         Implementing research levies for oats and cereal rye represents an extension of the Government's policy of encouraging increased contributions by primary industry for rural research, which was established in 1985. The Government made a commitment then to continue matching expenditure of approved industry levies on a dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of the relevant industry. This policy was reaffirmed in the May 1989 Government statement `Research, Innovation and Competitiveness'.

Production is centred mainly in Western Australia, estimated at 32 per cent in 1991-92; New South Wales, 28 per cent; Victoria, 19 per cent; and South Australia, 19 per cent.

         The greater proportion of the oats crop—an estimated 72 per cent in 1991-92—is used on the domestic market where oats have long been an important supplement to the successful operation of grazing enterprises involving sheep and cattle. Oats are used either as a grazing supplement and for fodder reserves, or for the production of hay and silage. Export sales of grain, which average around 220,000 tonnes annually, are also an important outlet which is expected to earn around $32m in 1991-92.

         Australian production of approximately 20,000 tonnes per annum is concentrated in the mallee regions of Victoria and South Australia. Although production is small, it plays an important role in overall farm management. Cereal rye is one of the few cropping alternatives for the mallee sandhills, not only allowing producers to obtain an economic return from land that may otherwise be left idle but also preventing erosion and stabilising these soils.

The recent upsurge in food and lifestyle awareness has resulted in a major upswing in the interest in, and demand for, health foods. Overall demand for rye has not always been satisfied from domestic production, which has necessitated imports in recent years which peaked at 10,000 tonnes in 1989-90.

         The Australian deer industry is an emerging industry moving from a rapidly expanding phase with heavy dependence on breeding stock sales, to a more mature situation where venison and velvet are the principal income sources. The deer herd has been growing at about 25 per cent per annum on average in recent years. It is estimated that there were about 155,000 deer on over 1,000 farms at the end of 1991. The main species are fallow deer and red deer, which make up 50 per cent and 40 per cent of the herd respectively. The remaining 10 per cent comprises mainly tropical species. Velvet production offers producers an additional source of income from deer farming, with most velvet being destined for medicinal use in Asia. There is also a small by-product industry producing leather.

        In recent times we have seen the rapid internationalisation of financial markets. In practice, geographic and political boundaries are becoming more and more irrelevant to the way in which the world goes about its business. This trend towards internationalisation has led in turn to world markets becoming increasingly interdependent. Trends in one national market have immediate effects on other markets throughout the world. No better example of this interdependence can be found than in the stock market crash of 1987 which spread almost simultaneously through the world's established and emerging securities markets.

         This process of internationalisation creates administrative, jurisdictional, detection and enforcement difficulties not only for the international aspect of trading but also for the regulation of domestic markets. This in turn increases the scope for the pursuit of undesirable market practices across national boundaries and the penetration of domestic markets by undesirable operators.

         At the Commonwealth Law Ministers meeting in Auckland in 1990, Ministers identified the need for mutual assistance in the area of business regulation.

         In answer to these international calls for closer cooperation, this Bill sets up the framework for Australian agencies, such as the Australian Securities Commission and the Trade Practices Commission, to provide assistance to their overseas counterparts. As a result of the legislation, these agencies will be better placed to seek assistance in their own investigations from their foreign counterparts. In short, the proposed legislation would enable prescribed Australian agencies, with the Attorney-General's consent, to compel the provision of information documents and sworn testimony in aid of requests from foreign agencies.

        The purpose of this Bill is to remove certain immunities available to witnesses under the Australian Securities Commission, ASC, law and the corporations law. The need for the legislation arises from difficulties encountered by the Australian Securities Commission in investigating complex corporate frauds, to which I shall refer shortly.

         At the outset, however, it is necessary to understand the background against which the issues addressed in this Bill arise. It has been an established rule of the common law, since the seventeenth century, that a person cannot be compelled to incriminate himself, and may refuse to answer any question, or produce any document or thing, which may put him at risk of conviction. This rule arose out of the principle, fundamental to our system of justice, that the Crown must prove the guilt of accused persons, rather than allow the Executive to require suspects to convict themselves out of their own mouths.

         In various circumstances, however, legislatures have recognised that the intended purpose of a statute may only be achieved by either limiting or abrogating this privilege against self-incrimination. The superseded cooperative scheme companies legislation, which preceded the current national scheme legislation, was such a case. Under that scheme the National Companies and Securities Commission could conduct examinations in which the common law privilege against self-incrimination was excluded by legislation. In return, the legislation provided an immunity, known as the `use immunity' which prevented answers which tended to be self-incriminatory from later being used in evidence against a person in criminal proceedings or proceedings for the imposition of a penalty.

         In 1983, the then Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, in the decision Sorby v. The Commonwealth (1983) 152 CLR 281, criticised a narrow application of such use immunities, stating that evidence obtained through, or derived from, the evidence protected by the use immunity should also be inadmissible in proceedings against the person—the so-called `derivative use immunity'.

         This suggestion was taken up by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, when in its 1984 report on the National Crime Authority Bill 1983 it advocated that where the privilege against self-incrimination was abolished by Parliament, the prosecution should be unable to use in evidence either the actual incriminating words and documents produced under compulsion, or any evidence discovered as a result of those words and documents. This `use/derivative use immunity' is now applied by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.

         In reporting on the Australian Securities Commission Bill, however, the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation stated, at paragraph 4.60, its belief that:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Subclause 68(3) [drafted in compliance with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's policy of `use/derivative use immunity'] will not unnecessarily or unacceptably act to abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination if it were amended to apply only to statements made by a person and not to any information, document or any other thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person making the statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Though suggesting that removal of the derivative use immunity would be appropriate, the Committee did not include a recommendation to that effect in its report. Subsection 68(3) of the ASC law therefore provides a use/derivative use immunity in respect of information obtained by the ASC in investigations.

         The Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions, the agencies responsible respectively for investigating and prosecuting corporate fraud, have been experiencing serious problems in bringing effective prosecutions as the `use immunity' prevents the admission of evidence of the fact that a particular person produced a particular document, and the `derivative use immunity' protects evidence gained as a result of answers to questions.

         The problems being experienced may be understood from a hypothetical example. To protect shareholders and creditors of a corporation under investigation, the ASC may consider that its assets should be frozen and its dealings restrained. To do this, evidence may need to be obtained under compulsion from a key person. However, as any incriminating information gained, together with any evidence derived from that information, would attract immunity, that person could not subsequently be prosecuted. To avoid this, the ASC may try to obtain the evidence without questioning major suspects. While it does so, assets may be concealed or dissipated, disadvantaging creditors and shareholders. Thus, pursuit of remedies for the protection of shareholders and creditors may prevent successful criminal prosecutions, while major suspects whose evidence could uncover other serious offences calling for wider inquiries tend to be questioned narrowly, if at all, because the derivative use immunity provisions would allow them to escape conviction and punishment.

         It is also possible for persons to exploit, quite consciously, the immunity provisions by claiming that answers may tend to be self-incriminating, then making a full confession, thereby ensuring that no evidence will be admissible against them in criminal proceedings.

         Another problem arising from the application of the provisions is that complex cases involve the admission into evidence of hundreds, even thousands, of documents, all or many of which may be challenged by the defence on the grounds of derivative use immunity. This has the potential to make cases extremely lengthy and costly.

         Finally, because the fact that a person has produced a document is not admissible against the person, the link between the person's original possession of the document and its introduction into evidence against the person is broken.

         The law as it stands at present fails to take adequate account of the difficulties faced by the ASC and the DPP, the bodies responsible for effectively investigating and prosecuting corporate crime. The practical position is that the ASC cannot use its powers to investigate certain suspected criminal activity. The problems of proof created by the derivative use immunity and the immunity for the fact of a person signing a record or producing a document are affecting its role in corporate law enforcement.

         The issue was recently re-examined by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities which, in its report tabled on 15 November 1991, recommended the removal of the derivative use immunity from the national scheme, together with the use immunity with regard to the fact that a person has produced a document. It also recommended that corporations be expressly excluded from claiming the privilege against self-incrimination. These recommendations followed the recognition that the availability of full use-derivative use immunity is threatening to defeat the purpose of significant portions of the corporations legislation.

It removes the immunity in respect of the fact that a person had produced a document from subsection 68(3) of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989, and confines the availability of the remaining use immunity to natural persons.

         The removal of the right to claim the privilege against self-incrimination from bodies corporate in the legislation is to overcome the uncertainty resulting from the decision of the High Court of Australia in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v. Trade Practices Commission, 1983, 152 CLR 328 where it was assumed, but not decided, that the common law privilege against self-incrimination applied to corporations. In that case Mr Justice Murphy, at page 346, expressed the view that:

        The privilege is personal, so that one required to produce documents cannot resist production on the ground that this would tend to incriminate another.

        The Bill does not, however, adopt a further recommendation of the Committee that there be a five-year sunset clause on these amendments.

         That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Air Traffic Service Centres, Brisbane and Melbourne.

        My colleague the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins) has endorsed a proposal by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to construct two air traffic service centres as part of the Australian advanced air traffic system (TAAATS). The strategy for the development of TAAATS is based on a far-reaching reorganisation of aerospace categorisation, resectorisation and air traffic service procedures, starting structures and facilities.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The CAA will change air space categorisation to bring Australia into line with international practice and international civil aviation organisations standards. Such an approach is considered the most cost-effective way for the CAA to provide air traffic services to the Australian aviation industry into the next century.

         TAAATS will replace existing air traffic service networks with an integrated system of computer and communications elements, enabling high operator productivity through the use of proven automation and support technology. The system will be commissioned by late 1995.

         The proposal being referred to the Committee will provide the necessary floor space to accommodate TAAATS. The proposal is for two new air traffic service centres of similar design, one in Brisbane and the other in Melbourne. Both will be to a maximum of 6,000 square metres on two levels comprising an operational area of approximately 2,000 square kilometres—which also includes the operations centre, which is the heart of the total facility, with all other areas and support functions performed in this zone—an equipment area of approximately 1,800 square metres where the technical services are housed, maintained and supported; a service area of approximately 1,200 square metres which contains all electrical and mechanical equipment, including a standby power generator and air conditioning plant; and, finally, an administration facility of approximately 1,200 square metres, which will accommodate amenities, including staff dining and recreation facilities as well as housing and administration support, and which will be the focal point for public access to the building.

         The CAA estimate for the proposal is $50m. The CAA will maximise the use of existing buildings and this may ultimately reduce the size of the building as the projects proceed. Signing of the prime TAAATS contract, of which these works are part, is scheduled for June 1992. To facilitate this program the proposals are being referred to the Committee at the schematic design stage. I now table the drawings of the proposal and commend the motion to the House.

         However, the Opposition welcomes this move and the recommendation that the Public Works Committee investigate it straightaway. As the Minister said in his preamble, what will actually be happening is that Australian aviation will be moving into the twenty-first century and we should see a great number of reductions in the cost of being able to provide air traffic control services not only to the airlines and the aviators of Australia, but also to the travelling public. The Opposition welcomes this motion and trusts that the Public Works Committee will investigate and undertake this work as fast as it possibly can. I am sure we all look forward to seeing exactly what happens in the tendering procedures and the issuing of contracts for the provision of equipment, which the Minister has indicated will come in 1992. I sincerely hope there will be a fair Australian component in that contract.

         The proposed amendments in this Bill for the electronic communication and lodgment of import information are a continuation of the improvements and updating of entry facilities which were initiated by the exit amendments for export information, introduced into the Customs Act by Act No. 111 of 1990.

         Similar to the exit scheme, the electronic lodgment system for imports, known as Compile, will operate on the basis of legislative amendments and contractual arrangements between the Customs Service and users of the system. The proposed principal Act legislative amendments are in a similar format and style to the successful exit amendments passed by this Parliament in the 1990 Budget sittings, and will essentially introduce an electronic computer option for the communication to Customs of information concerning imported goods, to complement the current documentary manual entry facilities.

         The Compile system includes a sophisticated regime of profiles designed to identify consignments as `high risk', `potential risk' or `low risk' for both revenue and community protection issues. These profiles can be altered by Customs to target specific types of goods or destinations and can be further refined on the basis of intelligence and data relating to importing practices. Such intelligence is received from a wide variety of sources, both national and international. The profiles may also be amended on national and regional levels and therefore are sufficiently flexible to be able to address local issues.

         Compile has been programmed to ask the user a series of questions to determine the exact nature of the goods being imported. In essence the information required under both the new electronic and the existing manual regimes is similar. When the full particulars of the goods have been keyed in, the Compile system has the facility to react to that information and make any necessary adjustment to the risk rating which applies to the goods. Immediately after transmission of an electronic entry, Compile will advise the user that the entry is available for any payment of duties which might be owing, or it will require the user to present documentation relating to the transaction if a risk has been identified.

        This Bill is an omnibus Bill amending three Acts administered within the transport and communications portfolio. While none of the proposed amendments involve significant policy changes, they are important for the general administration of the transport and communications portfolio.

         Part 2 of this Bill proposes a number of miscellaneous amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920. Many of these changes make the law in relation to international aircraft movements clearer to the aviation industry both in Australia and overseas. They provide for consistency in the area of aircraft operations and clarity in relation to offences committed under the Act. The changes also remove ambiguities which exist at the moment between provisions in the Act and provisions in the regulations. These changes do not impact adversely on industry as there is no proposed tightening of regulatory powers in this area. The amendments do, however:

        I will address each of these amendments in turn. Section 22 of the Act currently contains a general offence provision which sets a single penalty in respect of each of the offences contained in the Act. General offence provisions of this kind have been criticised by the courts for failing to provide any indication of the relative seriousness of each of the offences contained in the Act and therefore providing no guidance in the exercise of the discretion of a sentencing court. They have also been criticised as being unhelpful in determining whether an offence has actually been committed, that is, determining whether a particular provision creates an obligation with criminal sanctions or is purely administrative.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The offences are now stated in the Act itself. That is, the amendments contained in the present Bill describe each of the offences in the Act and allocate an appropriate penalty. Section 22 is repealed.

         The second group of amendments concerns the licensing provisions of the Act. At present, the Act deals specifically with the grant of international airline licences, permissions and approvals to foreign aircraft. Complementary provisions in relation to Australian aircraft are contained mostly in the regulations. The amendments will transfer and amalgamate these provisions into the Act so that powers for the regulation of Australian aircraft operating scheduled and non-scheduled flights are co-located and provide similarly to those for foreign aircraft.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Finally, the Bill amends the power to make regulations in section 26 of the Act. In accordance with Commonwealth criminal law policy, serious offences warranting a penalty of imprisonment will be contained in the Act rather than the regulations. Secondly, the regulations will enable a person who is alleged to have contravened a specified provision of the regulations to pay an on the spot fine as an alternative to prosecution. The level of the fine would not exceed one-fifth of the maximum penalty payable by a person who is prosecuted for a breach of the specified regulation. I emphasise that the payment of an on the spot fine is an alternative to prosecution which is not intended to deprive a person from seeking to defend the matter should he or she choose to do so.

         Except in the provision of a stronger deterrent for unlicensed scheduled operations, the Bill does not introduce any new regulatory powers. The new provisions of subsections 13A(3), 14(3A), 15(2C) and 17(1B) specify certain categories of flights which may be exempt from the requirement to obtain prior permission. This Government has deregulated many areas of the aviation industry as part of its micro-economic reform program. This Bill introduces, in a small way, some further opportunities for administrative savings for both the industry and the Department.

         I am advised by the Department that it has already begun to exempt certain categories of flights in accordance with guidelines issued by the Government for certain categories of charter flights. The provisions in this Bill make the legislative base for doing this very clear. Such measures mean less contact by aircraft operators with government bureaucracy and reduced public service surveillance and expenditure.

         Part 3 of the Bill contains measures to correct drafting anomalies arising from amendments to the Broadcasting Act 1942 contained in the Broadcasting Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991. Firstly, the Bill will make minor changes to the definitions of `AM commercial radio licence' and `non-metropolitan FM commercial radio licence' contained in the Broadcasting Act. Subsection 89D(5A) of the Broadcasting Act enables the holder of a non-metropolitan AM commercial radio licence to seek to convert to FM by applying to vary the technical conditions of the licence warrant. However, the existing definition of an AM commercial radio licence excludes those licences where the warrant includes an FM translator, even though the main service may be on AM. The amendment will clarify that the Minister may convert such non-metropolitan AM commercial radio licences to FM by changing the technical conditions of the licence warrant.

         Part 4 of the Bill corrects a drafting oversight in the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Act 1991. This concerns the level of licence fees to be paid under paragraph 6(2A)(e) of the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964. The current licence fee ceiling of 6.5 per cent for licensees with revenues greater than $10m contained in paragraph 6(2A)(e) should have been reduced by 50 per cent by the 1991 Amendment Act. The current 6.5 per cent licence fee ceiling will be reduced to 3.25 per cent by this Bill to give effect to the original intention of the 1991 amendments.

A mechanism has been included to require the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to refund the difference between the amount of licence fees paid by affected licensees as calculated under the existing formula—with the 6.5 per cent ceiling—and the amount that would have been payable under the amended formula.

        The amendments to the Broadcasting Act 1942 and the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964 correct anomalies arising from amendments in the Broadcasting Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991 and the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Act 1991. Accordingly, the amendments will ensure that the financial impact identified for those Bills will be achieved. In particular, the amendments to the Radio Licence Fees Act will ensure that the expected financial impact—a decrease in Commonwealth revenue of $8m in the 1991-92 financial year—for the halving of annual licence fees for commercial, supplementary and remote licences occurs.

        The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill makes various amendments to revise provisions concerning conscription and conscientious objection; enable the appointment of the Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Personnel) to the Defence Housing Authority; tidy up legislation providing for Defence retirement benefits and home loans assistance schemes; and repeal obsolete retirement benefits provisions.

         The only legislation currently in force which provides for conscription and conscientious objection is contained in part IV of the Defence Act, which limits compulsory military service to a time of war. In this context, it is important to note that `time of war' has a defined and limited meaning: a period of actual or apprehended enemy invasion of, or attack on, Australia. I would like to assure the House that the current amendments do not alter this fundamental threshold. The Government's view continues to be that conscription could be justified where Australia is directly threatened but not otherwise.

         The amendments now proposed stem from the Government's decision, announced in the Senate by Senator Gareth Evans on 5 December 1986, to accept recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. The essential changes would add recognition of conscientious objection to particular conflicts, as distinct from war in general, and require prior parliamentary approval of conscription.

         I doubt that anyone would argue these days against the requirement for prior parliamentary approval of conscription. The desirability of providing for conscientious objection to particular conflicts might not be quite so self-evident. However, the Government was persuaded by the view of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs that, in some cases, an individual's sense of personal integrity could be violated by compulsion to participate in a particular military conflict but not in other conflicts.

         An important element of the new provisions is definition of a person's conscientious belief as one that involves a fundamental conviction of what is morally right and morally wrong, whether or not based on religious considerations; is so compelling in character for that person that he or she is duty bound to espouse it; and is likely to be of a longstanding nature.

         This definition would give clear guidance to tribunals considering claims of conscientious belief but is sufficiently broad to ensure coverage of any genuine case. Although Australian legislation has recognised conscientious objection to compulsory military service for more than 80 years, the nature of the conscientious belief required has been determined largely by judicial decisions on claims. In this most significant area, the Government believes that the Parliament by legislation should set out the key characteristics of conscientious belief to ensure that there is clear and consistent guidance for future decisions.

         Another important innovation is provision for establishment of special conscientious objection tribunals. Of course, such tribunals would be established only in the most unlikely event of conscription to meet a threat to Australia. The old model, of traditional adversarial proceedings before a magistrate, has been abandoned as inappropriate. New tribunals would be established for the specific purpose of determining claims of conscientious beliefs. They would be composed of a presiding member who had at least seven years experience as a legal practitioner, and two other members who were capable of ascertaining facts other than by adversarial procedures.

         The legislation specifically requires conscientious objection tribunals to adopt quick, fair, just and economical procedures. They are also required to act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case, and are not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence. Although the tribunals are clearly expected to operate as informally as possible, they are given sufficient formal powers, such as the capacity to summon witnesses, to exercise their functions.

         Conscientious objection tribunals would normally take oral evidence in public but would have a discretion to take evidence in private or to take written evidence.

         —The House is debating the Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill. Perhaps one of the more interesting areas under the environment part of this portfolio has been the conflict over the use of native forests in Australia. I have tracked this debate in the Parliament for some years and I began to realise that often the conflict between the Commonwealth and the States over the use of forests arose simply because neither group knew exactly what was out there.

         Often when the Commonwealth was given advice by the Australian Heritage Commission about the importance of the need to conserve certain areas of native environment, we could not sit down with a State government, whether from New South Wales, Victoria or Western Australia, and agree upon the values that we could measure in respect of a certain forest. In other words, the groups at State Government level which managed the native forests were often seeking to preserve things other than those which were important to the Commonwealth. Often at no stage did the Commonwealth and the States talk the same language about the need to conserve the central and essential values of our native forests.

         What has often occurred is that, where conservation groups have sought to save areas from logging in native forests, they have come to the Commonwealth as a means of appeal and sought to use the Australian Heritage Commission Act to force the Commonwealth to put a stopper on the logging of native forests. They would list the forest under what we call a National Estate listing. That would cause the Commonwealth, literally, to become involved in a fight over the future use of Australian forests.

         The Government has moved in any manner of ways to resolve that sort of conflict. In fact, later we will be debating a Bill about resource security. I am not pre-empting that debate by any means, but there has been a terrific and really positive process worked out in the past couple of months, which I want to relay to this Parliament. It will obviate this need for conflict between the State and Commonwealth governments, between conservationists and foresters. We finally have a process between the Commonwealth, through the Australian Heritage Commission, and a State land management authority—in this case, in Western Australia—in which they can sit down, survey a whole region of forest and agree on those areas which ought to be preserved for all time and those areas which should decently be logged under proper and careful management. There is no need for us to go through this process of cat and mouse, of playing off one set of statistics and data against another.

         I refer to a recent joint proposal between the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia and the Australian Heritage Commission. Those two bodies have taken a very large region of south-west Western Australia and have now agreed jointly about the key values of forests in that region. When we list forests on what we call the National Estate, we are speaking the same language as that used by the Department of Conservation and Land Management, which has a responsibility to manage, often for forestry purposes, those same forests.

         We have now struck upon a means of operating together, and I predict that in this area of south-west Western Australia the Commonwealth will no longer be used as a sort of second court of appeal on behalf of conservationists to see whether we can put a stop on foresters. In a sense, we have already done that work; there has been an agreement about what should or should not be logged.

         I will describe some of that process which I think will be a turning point in the debilitating forest issues. The model was the culmination of more than a year's work between the Department of Conservation and Land Management and the Australian Heritage Commission. It is the very first systematic regional study of National Estate forests ever undertaken jointly by the Commonwealth and a State government department. We are hoping that it will become a model for similar agreements in the future between the Commission and other State agencies. In that process the two organisations have carried out an exhaustive analysis of the National Estate significance of no less than 1.2 million hectares of forests in the southern forest regions of Western Australia and 134 individual values in forests were identified and assessed.

         Talking about values, of course, if one were to talk to a forester about what is valuable in a native forest and then talk to someone who is concerned about the conservation of a forest, obviously the things they measure are quite different. Often—perhaps always—that was the source of conflict between conservationists and foresters: what are we seeking to achieve with our native forests? Under this legislation, the experts could get together and sort it out before we got into a major bunfight between two sides which often become political forces.

         In the past, places were listed on the Register of the National Estate in this ad hoc way as a dispute arose. Environmental groups have used this nomination process successfully to try to stop or delay proposed logging activities in listed forests in places such as East Gippsland, the Eden region and Tasmania. It was the apparent open-endedness of listings that created an uncertainty in the industry about future access to timber in places that were not currently listed in the Register but which could have been listed in the future, as well as uncertainty about future access to places which were listed already.

         The advantage of this new regional assessment—we have seen the first in Western Australia—is that it will result in all major forest areas of National Estate significance being identified and listed in the Register. That, of itself, will remove uncertainty about future listings. Furthermore, the regional assessment will provide a publicly stated framework for the way in which the Commission will provide advice about logging in forest areas. Again, this will reduce industry uncertainty about possible Commonwealth decisions about logging of the National Estate forests.

         We predict that as a consequence of this new regional assessment process there will be a great reduction in conflict about logging in the National Estate. I think there is a wide public perception—promoted by the industry and by environmentalists—that National Estate places are, or should be, treated like national parks. In fact, the two are quite different. National parks are established almost entirely by State governments for their own purposes and according to their own values. They sometimes cover National Estate forests; sometimes they do not. That is the sort of historical legacy we are now working through: getting the National Estate lined up with the sorts of values according to which the State management authorities would like to manage those areas.

         This has been a major source of conflict in forests in south-eastern New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.

We would have whole maps of areas which the Commonwealth would say ought to be saved and which the State would say ought to be saved and there would be barely an intersection between the two. There would be no decent basis upon which we could do other than see a fight between the Commonwealth and the State over the future management of forests.

         We have now found a means—a very obvious one; sitting down and working through the facts—by which we can obviate the need for that conflict. The advantage is that the regional assessment report provides a clear framework for the protection of National Estate values within a region, which includes listed areas occurring both in national parks and in multiple-use State forests—in other words, forests that might be logged. Where a State government is supporting a forest industry that affects National Estate areas, the reports clearly indicate that protection in national parks is only one aspect of protecting National Estate values within a region. It provides guidelines for the protection of National Estate values in multiple-use forests where logging will continue to take place.

         The beauty of this process is that at the end of the day foresters will know how much resource they can use. As seems to be the case in Western Australia, foresters will not be denied the resource; but, at the same time, the Commonwealth can be assured and reassured that its National Estate forests will not decline in the values for which we listed them. The regional perspective of where values are located, their abundance, their representation within nature conservation reserves and measures to protect values outside reserves provide a framework for government decision making which is far more likely to provide lasting solutions to National Estate forest issues than has been the case in the past.

         The memorandum between the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Government, for instance, provides the framework for protecting National Estate forests in Tasmania during forestry operations, but we have found that the MOU process is unwieldy. It requires, for instance, referrals for each forest activity proposed; for example, putting in a road or logging in a particular coop, an area of the forest. It involves very complex liaison between the industry, the Australian Heritage Commission, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and various other State and Commonwealth agencies.

         The Australian Heritage Commission's advice, without any context, has meant that often there were some difficult relations between one Commonwealth Minister and another—for instance, between the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. In other words, we had set up within the Commonwealth itself a certain amount of conflict which had to be sorted out. The MOU has most often resulted in fairly lengthy delays before Commonwealth approval is given, for instance, for logging to go ahead or for a road to be put in. Naturally, when we get those sorts of delays, the timber industry becomes somewhat agitated.

         Now, hopefully, when the regional assessment is applied in forests other than in Western Australia, we will find a comprehensive framework for Commonwealth decisions. There will be no need for these memorandum of understanding referrals. The costly delays in proceeding with logging will be avoided and the overall protection of National Estate values will be in a regional context, specifically to take into account the nature of conservation reserves.

         There are some further points that we believe will improve the debate about the Australian Heritage Commission itself. The Commission and its powers have come under an enormous amount of criticism from the forestry industry in the last couple of years, because it has been seen as the beast that stops forestry. It has not been; it is an important body that gives advice to the Commonwealth when we are unsure about the future use of native forests. I guess it is only reasonable and obvious that some would focus on the role of the Australian Heritage Commission. Here I think the Commission has got itself out from under that criticism. It has a way by which both sides, State and Commonwealth, can agree on the terms on which we will sort out which areas are to be forested or harvested and which areas are to be saved for all time.

        Estate places for the renewal of current woodchip export licences; for instance, in Tasmania, Western Australia and New South Wales. We now hope to find that the regional assessment will provide a comprehensive regional framework for the consideration of the impacts of logging, for feasible and prudent alternatives to logging, and measures to minimise the adverse impact of logging on National Estate places. I believe this will greatly speed the referral process between the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Commission and remove delays in the renewal of licences, such as has happened in the past.

         In Western Australia the MOU between the Commission and the Department of Conservation and Land Management provides the basis for ongoing cooperation for forestry operations related to export licence renewals. The other great pay-off is that there should be an improvement in discussions between the Commonwealth and States on those forestry issues. Again, the advantage of regional assessments, based on the experience in Western Australia, is that the cooperative approach to the regional assessment work will result in better relations between a range of State government departments, the Commission and, of course, Commonwealth departments. It should reinforce the improvements flowing from the intergovernmental agreement on the environment arising from the Special Premiers Conference.

         The regional assessment work provides a comprehensive, scientifically accurate view of a wide range of conservation values in any region. This knowledge base will assist in government decision-making in a range of areas; for example, biodiversity, endangered species, old growth forests and the development of representative conservation reserve systems. I congratulate both the Australian Heritage Commission and the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia for their excellent work.

Last night my colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) covered the amendments to six of those Acts.

         The amendments are fairly minor and deal principally with reporting procedures for those competitors who undertake drug tests in sport. Proposed new subsection 65A(1), (2) and (3) provide the Agency with the standard taxation exemptions under the Commonwealth, State and Territory law. It seems absolutely incredible to me that when the Government first drew up this Act nearly two years ago it failed to take that into consideration. Once again, we are cleaning up some sloppy drafting that should not have happened.

         I do not think any Senate inquiry in my time in this Parliament drew more interest, and in some ways more anger and more consternation, than the inquiry into drugs in sport that was headed by former Senator John Black and Senator Noel Crichton-Browne. I think a number of people in Australia were absolutely horrified when they learned how prevalent drugs in sport had become, not only in this country but around the world.

         My mind goes back to the debate a couple of years ago when this legislation was first introduced. It was said then that Australia was breaking new ground in this area and there was an opportunity for Australia to take the lead in world sport in trying to get rid of the problem of drugs in sport. Frankly, I think Australia has done very well in being at the forefront of the move around the world to get rid of drugs in sport. For those reasons, I congratulate the Chairman, the chief executive officer and the members of the board of the Drug Agency.

         It has been quite fascinating to see that Australia has very much taken the lead in getting international focus on the scourge of drugs in sport and international action to try to eliminate drugs in sport. In the debate a couple of years ago it was suggested that one of the things that should happen was that sports should be responsible for their own drug testing. Not only was it argued that a number of sports could not afford such a commitment; it was also argued that it was important to have an independent agency who could fairly test it and would gain recognition as an independent organisation. That has happened. It is good to see that the international working group on drugs in sport, which in fact is working on the international anti-dope charter in sport, includes the chief executive of the Australian Sports Drug Agency.

         Australia has also been in the lead in providing advice to the International Olympic Committee. In some 50 international events Australia has been very much involved in providing drug testing. Even those former Iron Curtain countries which tended to move towards drug use in some areas have acknowledged the tremendous work that the Agency has done.

         One of the comments that came out of a recent international meet was that Australia was like a warm light to the people of these areas as it was leading the way in trying to get rid of the scourge of drugs in sport. The independence of the Agency has meant that in a number of parts of the world Australia is being looked to as providing the lead in the establishment of similar agencies and in the eradication of drugs in sport, and that is good.

         It costs the taxpayers of Australia a relatively small amount to keep this particular Agency in place. The Agency is to be congratulated on already starting to earn some funds of its own through its testing programs. This has resulted from arrangements being made with organisations such as the Rugby League and the Australian Football League, which make some payments for these tests. The Agency is looking towards the international provision of services as another means of raising income. So in that respect there are also some great advantages for Australia.

         There are a number of programs promoted by the Agency which are probably not heard of terribly often but which give great justification for the Commonwealth continuing to support the Australian Sports Drug Agency. The programs provided for schools and individual sporting organisations should be commended. We should look particularly towards the arrangements the Agency has made with organisations such as the Australian Rugby League, the Federation of Police and Citizens Youth Clubs, the MLC Junior Sports Foundation and the ACT Sports Foundation as being fine examples of what can be achieved in the education of our young athletes in terms of their futures and in terms of keeping them drug free. Obviously, there is tremendous pressure on athletes to go out and win. In today's sporting environment winning often means the difference between making a lot of money and no money at all. I suppose the temptations are there, but the down side of drug taking associated with sport is horrendous. These educational programs, along with the school based programs, certainly should be commended.

         The whole idea of this program is to take the cheats out of sport and to provide the way ahead for genuine athletes. For that reason, we should continue our support for the Australian Sports Drug Agency. The amendments in the Bill before us today are quite minor. They result in some tightening up of compliance in reporting the drug tests that have been happening. I support the amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act as outlined in this Bill.

         It is through processes such as the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts into drugs in sport and the consciousness which has been raised within the community through the education programs which the inquiry generated that we have seen a considerable resurgence of research into sport and the kind of effect which sport has upon the Australian community.

         While all of us here would recognise that sport generally has played a very important part in the lives of many Australians, 54 per cent of our female population have been denied active participation in sport. Some of the facts relevant to women's participation, particularly that of girls, are very important. When we are looking at ways to ensure that sport is fairly treated and that the drugs in sport issue is acknowledged, we need also to look at encouraging all people to participate in sport. Some research has been done relating to sports participation of girls which has thrown up some very frightening statistics: there are more unfit girls than there are unfit boys; the aerobic fitness of girls on average declines after the age of 12 or the onset of puberty; and prepubescent girls on average tend to be inferior to those of boys of the same age in various performance measures of fitness, except in the area of flexibility. Yet, at this early age there are no significant physical differences to explain these different performances.

         We also have to ask why there are more obese girls than boys. It was found that girls in general have a lower self-esteem and more negative self-concept than boys, but that women and girls who are involved in physical activity have a higher level of self-esteem than others. So the active campaign of sports for girls is very important: it is not simply an issue of sport; it is also an issue of self-esteem and of developing self-concept, leading to a whole range of other abilities.

         One of the most interesting programs at present is the women in engineering program which is attempting to attract women into undertaking engineering courses at our universities. Some of the research done there has found that our girls are conditioned in years one to three of primary school into thinking that jobs such as engineering are a bit dirty and that they really should not do these sorts of things. If this is reinforced with the negative concept of self-esteem through their lack of sporting ability and lack of access to facilities, we are creating not simply a society with a large number of unfit obese girls and young women, and girls and young women who may be a little too fat, but a society more than half the members of which have low self-esteem and self-concept and are not pursuing the kind of courses and trades which will enable them to have employment into the year 2001.

         While we see changes happening to the Sports Drug Agency and are concerned to make sure that all aspects of sport are fair, we must also look at a whole range of ways in which we tend to treat sport within our community. Adult sport participation can be traced back to childhood reinforcements of parental interest, encouragement and participation in organised sport as youths. It is quite obvious that the behaviour of parents influences that of their daughters. It has been found that parents who play sport tend to have daughters who play. A recent US report states that 70 per cent of daughters who currently participate have parents who also engage in sports or fitness activities. We have no reason to believe that that would be any different in Australia.

The figures for the time factor and the interest in other activities are interesting. We need to ensure that sport is given equal status with some of the other interests in our community so that we can use some of the very good things about sport, such as the development of self-concept, self-esteem and confidence, as well as learning to work together as a team and so on.

         Our community as a whole has not always recognised the value of sporting women to us. Indeed, only 2.5 per cent of total sports reporting space is devoted to women's sport. This trend has not changed significantly in eight years. In space devoted to reporting all sporting results, women's sport occupies only eight per cent of the total. Even with photographs we get 12 to one, men as to women. It seems to be quite an extraordinary difference.

This is a remarkable achievement when one considers that only 22 per cent of the events are available to women, but only 19 per cent of the participants are women.

She is a doctor by profession and is interested in the health and fitness process. Senator Crowley had a cartoon which showed the Australian men's hockey team slinking off in 1988 with somebody saying, `They played like girls'. Somebody said, `They did not, because the girls won the gold medal and they were unable to do so'. There have always been those sorts of elements, I guess.

It is not a fact that women who achieve peak status and achieve very well at home do not achieve well in international fields; in fact, they achieve very well but do not get recognised.

Community and cultural pressures are such that we are creating fat little girls who are lacking in self-esteem and self-confidence. That is a real problem. One way this problem has been addressed is through the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program which was announced in last year's Budget with an allocation of $30m. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure your electorate will be participating in this program. It has provided real money for sporting grants within the community so the local netball association, the local softball association, the local croquet players, bowlers or whatever will get some sporting facilities for themselves.

A soccer group, and others, in my electorate have had an opportunity to participate in these grants through this program. The program provides the opportunity for smaller sporting groups in the community to make sport real, accessible and equitable for people.

It is probably the last remaining bit of bushland in that part of Sydney. It is like an oasis in an otherwise built up area.

A spectacular row of Norfolk Island pines were cut down during the second world war to make way for an aerodrome. This is still lamented by the old timers on the island who remember it. Unfortunately, it had to happen. There was no choice; it was wartime. An aerodrome had to be built. It is a price paid for progress. But the locals are still upset that the pines were cut down by the mainlanders, Australians, and that a lovely part of their environment was so compromised.

         But the environment can best be protected by countries who can afford to protect it. The environmental standards in some Third World countries are absolutely appalling. It is only affluent countries such as Australia, North America and Europe that provide protection for the environment. It is interesting to compare the standard of the environment in the old western Germany and eastern Germany. There were similar people under two different regimes: one affluent, able to introduce laws to control vehicle and plant emissions; and the other, eastern Germany, not as affluent because of the system under which it suffered for so long and a place in which vehicle and plant emissions were so bad that the rest of Europe was contaminated.

I think it is probably a signal that they will put the aviation industry on their agenda and take steps either to compromise it or close it down altogether, just as they have done with the mining industry.

         It is interesting to note that minerals and energy exports grew by 173 per cent to nearly $28 billion over the past seven years. The prospects for the years ahead are even more promising. These are industries that have due regard for the environment; they are not the savage predators who want to lay waste to our landscape, but sometimes when resource companies are critical of activities of the environmental movements, people get the impression that the resource sector wants to have open slather. That is certainly not true. The mining industry, which makes such a valuable contribution to the balance of payments, accepts the need for environmental regulation. While we are putting in place legislation that protects our environment, let us put into some perspective the need to provide long term security to this industry.

         Another example of extreme steps taken by so-called environmental groups in the name of protecting the environment is their unreasonable stand on the environmental impact study done on the third runway at Sydney Airport recently. The third runway will in fact reduce the number of people who will be subject to aircraft noise, but some people will experience aircraft noise for the first time. Some will get more noise but the majority will get less noise. There are also those who believe their property values will somehow be adversely affected by overflying aircraft.

         —In the second reading debate on this Bill I indicated that the Opposition would move an amendment to that part of the Bill that relates to the ACT planning ministry.

         The Opposition has suggested that this should be modified by requiring the Commonwealth Minister to consult with the relevant ACT Minister. Since the ACT has self-government we thought it was appropriate that there should be that degree of involvement. I foreshadowed an amendment in terms of moving that certain words be inserted. I am grateful to the Minister at the table that this suggestion was examined over night. There has been consultation between my office and that of Senator Parer, the relevant shadow Minister in the Opposition, and the office of the Minister. The Minister has suggested an alternative wording, which is satisfactory to the Opposition. I now move the amendment in the form that was suggested to us by the Minister. I am sure she will speak for herself but the Opposition believes this achieves its purpose in different words. Therefore I move the amendment, which is to page 2, proposed new subsection 20A of the Bill:

         The purpose of the fees is to defray the administrative expenses in dealing with applications for approval. It was always intended that they should be payable regardless of whether the approval is ultimately granted, granted only in part, or refused. As the provisions currently stand, they could be interpreted to mean that the NCPA may not collect, or must indeed refund, the fees if an approval sought is not wholly granted. These amendments avoid that possibility by providing that fees may be charged in relation to all proposals submitted to the authority, irrespective of the final outcome.

        Might I begin by saying that as we have just seen the handkerchief passed across the table, as it was yesterday, the leopard never changes its spots. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) sticks to the old ideas and the old arguments. There has been nothing new out of this man in the last nine years.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Might I also point out that it is a white handkerchief today, which I take to be surrender; yesterday it was a blue handkerchief. Yesterday we sought to show that this Prime Minister cannot be believed, that he has zero credibility when it comes to matters of economic management and economic policy. He has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented our economic circumstances during his entire period in government.

         Yesterday we gave you dozens of examples of how he had misrepresented the state of the economy, whether or not there would be a recession, the nature of the recovery and the `successes' of his so-called economic management. If our questions did not clearly establish that point yesterday, his answers certainly did because, again, he failed to live up to the pledge he made the day he became Prime Minister. To remind the Prime Minister what he said at that time, the day he became Prime Minister he put down three pledges. The second pledge was:

        He went on to say:

        In tough times, of course, the temptation is always to gild the lily. I'll be resisting that temptation as much as it's humanly possible. I'll speak honestly with them, to them, and realistically. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        At the first opportunity that this Prime Minister has had to do precisely that, and to honour that pledge—which was given yesterday in this Parliament in Question Time—he fell over at that hurdle. He failed to live up to the pledge to tell the truth. In fact, he deliberately and knowingly misrepresented the work of a respected academic economist and now business economist, an ex-Treasury officer, whose work has been fundamental to the development of modelling in Treasury, apart from a number of other places. He deliberately and knowingly misrepresented that person's views.

         Yesterday was a day, of course, when the Prime Minister was under a lot of pressure. He had to prove that he could really do it, and that he really still had it. He was worried about the image that would be created in the gallery: was he still the same tough old performer? So, as is typical of this person, as is characteristic of his career, he will say anything or do anything—he will lie, he will cheat, he will misrepresent; he will do anything, he will deal with anybody—

Nobody in Treasury believes that. Murphy certainly does not believe that and certainly did not say that. I ask the Prime Minister,`Who says that our package will make the economy smaller?' That is a total and deliberate misrepresentation of the facts. He also went on to say that Murphy was the economist who had simulated our package, he was the econometrician who had put our package together—a rather novel claim, given that Murphy joined Access Economics a few weeks before the Fightback package was delivered and he had only done a technical piece of analysis, which is included as an appendix. He did not design the Fightback package.

For example, he claimed that the recession only cost 3 per cent in GDP, which was less than the claim he said would flow from the Fightback package, which has been proved to be wrong. The overall cost of the recession so far is 7 per cent—and I say `so far'; he claims 3 per cent on his own recession. He deliberately and knowingly understated the effect of that change.

         —When we find that the author or one of the principal architects of that program is a mate of the Prime Minister's press secretary, we start to wonder whether this is not going to be a pattern. It begs the question whether we are not seeing a pattern where they ignore the facts, ignore the truth, ignore what is said, and just get on and manufacture circumstances in which they can run during the following week. So against that background I ask the Prime Minister whether he is going to draw on the resources of his staff in that way. Presumably they were the ones who made these miscalculations on the impact on GDP of his own recession that were referred to yesterday.

         I ask him why he did not look at the work of one of his other advisers, his principal economic adviser, John Edwards, who has actually assessed the Fightback package and who has actually made some very important statements about the substance of the Fightback package. For example, he said:

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">

        You do not like this, do you—one of your advisers being quoted back to you? Secondly he said:

         I don't think it is worth arguing that a goods and services tax will cause inflation as distinct from a one time increase in the price level or recession. It might, but in reasonable circumstances it will not.

       </para>
       <para>
        So on most aspects of the package the Government's own principal economic adviser has actually given us a clean bill of health and says it is worth doing. The particular element that he focused on in some of those quotes, payroll tax, represents a very important challenge to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is bringing down a statement tonight which is designed to create jobs. He himself said back in 1977 that the abolition of payroll tax at that time would create 200,000 jobs. Let us look at how many jobs he will create tonight and whether he has the courage of his convictions to actually deliver a substantial change in payroll tax that will bring about those sorts of results.

         We now know that the Prime Minister has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented the work of Dr Murphy, and Dr Murphy has responded by describing the Prime Minister's parliamentary performance as false, inaccurate, a significant misrepresentation, heavily distorted and `he got it wrong'. If you do not want to believe me, you can believe the author of the paper who has made those comments about you.

         There are two central issues to this censure motion. One is to pose a direct and deliberate question to the Prime Minister: did he deliberately misrepresent a respected academic's research to suit his own political ends? If he did, is he man enough to say that he did? Is he man enough to say that he was wrong? Is he man enough to apologise to the academic economist concerned? Secondly, there is the broader issue about whether this Prime Minister can be believed in anything he says. Can this Prime Minister be believed? That is the significant issue that should be an essential background to tonight's economic statement. This statement is supposed to bring a fresh start to this country. We have seen so many fresh starts before from this Prime Minister.

         Let us just go back and run over a few of the claims that this man has made in the past about his economic management. We will not go all the way; we will just start back in 1987 when he said in the May statement:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Tonight I can report that Australia is winning.
       </para>
       <para>
        In September 1987, following the Budget of that year, he said—and you want to wait and focus on this one because it is worth bottling:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is the great coming of age of Australia. This is the golden age of economic change.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sure the one million unemployed are going to be delighted to hear that. The golden age! Then in 1988 he was getting carried away with his rhetoric, which, as honourable members know, is not characteristic of this man. He said in terms of the Budget:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is the one which brings home the bacon.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was not anywhere near as far as he went on that occasion. I know that one has had a lot of publicity. He actually said quite a lot more. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . without a doubt the crowning glory of anything the Australian Treasury and any government have ever produced.
       </para>
       <para>
        A modest understatement, of course! Then in 1989 when circumstances were running against him he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like the Prime Minister to go down to some of the unemployment lines in Coburg and ask the people in them whether they think the social structure is improving and how deep the recession has actually gone. In August 1990 he capped it all when he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These are definitely the golden years of change. Of course they are the golden years of change.
       </para>
       <para>
        Everyone was getting a bit worried by 1990 that what he had been saying for several years was not happening; but he kept reassuring everyone. Remember all those other statements: `There will be no recession', `There did not need to be any recession', `We won't let there be a recession' and, `The economy is recovering'. There is a whole string of these on the subject of the economy recovering from late 1989 or early 1990 right through 1991, and always the economy is just about to recover. I am sure we will hear again tonight that the economy is just about to recover. It has been just about to recover under this man for a couple of years as it presently stands.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So there are two questions to the Prime Minister: is he man enough to admit he was wrong, to admit that he deliberately misrepresented the facts, and is he man enough then to apologise to Dr Murphy? Secondly, what is he going to do tonight to set aside nine years of gross misrepresentation and distortion, a characteristic of which we saw yesterday on his first attempt in this Parliament. He does not worry about facts; they get in the way of his political career. He abuses them, twists them, contorts them and does whatever he wants to do in order to turn his circumstances around.

         The real issue tonight is whether this man can face our problems and can deliver the economic package that this country needs. We will scrutinise this package from two points of view: first, in economic terms, we will see whether this is an attempt to be more honest about our economic circumstances. Will the Prime Minister admit—as Access Economics has estimated and others are now confirming—that our Budget deficit this year is blowing out? Access Economics has said that it could be as high as $9m and, when you exclude the asset sales, as high as $12 billion. Will he be prepared to admit that? Will he be prepared to go with genuine labour market reform? Will he be prepared to go with genuine infrastructure reform?

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We have talked about micro reform. The Prime Minister has talked about micro reform for years. He has claimed that there is nothing more to reform. The only people who talked about micro reform were the galahs in the pet shop. Do you remember those statements? The Prime Minister had done it all years ago. It will be interesting to see whether he comes back tonight and admits that he has not done it all and that there is quite a lot to be done in infrastructure reform. Will he be prepared to face the issue of tax reform?
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One of the interesting and most telling points against this man and his attack on us, our package and the GST, is that he was the strongest advocate of this package back in 1985. I will just remind you of what he said in 1985. He said that this would result in a manifestly fairer tax system and would create the foundations for a more efficient system to promote stronger economic growth and higher living standards. That is what this man said in 1985 when he was advocating tax reform and a broad based goods and services tax. Yet now, when it suits his attempt to save his political hide, he distorts, misrepresents and takes the opposite side of an issue that he says he believed in in 1985.

         Secondly, tonight we will assess his package as a kickback package. We will look for the extent of the kickbacks, the political deals that have been done with Joan Kirner, John Bannon, Wally Curran and the ACTU, and all the factions on the other side.

         —The Leader of the Opposition made these claims and then withdrew them, as you requested, but then made others. The fact is that he could not tolerate one criticism of the central tenet of the Fightback GST package yesterday which goes right to the heart of it, and has suspended the Question Time period to move a proposition which says that I should be censured for deliberately misrepresenting his package. Then in the most petulant, brittle and glass jaw manner, he hops into me for being a liar, a cheat, a misrepresenter and a distorter.

You want to put this monkey on the back of every Australian worker and taxpayer and you want them to repent at their leisure as you sit up with the most economy-busting measure.

         —Mr Speaker, it is amazing: the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) still has not got the point. After four days, the penny is still to drop on the world's greatest Treasurer. Did you hear him: `The package will contract the size of the economy.'? Murphy did not say that; he never said anything like it. Yet this mug, with all the Treasury advice and all of the economists from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, still does not have the point. Maybe we got it wrong; we said that he deliberately misrepresented the situation. But even after that performance he still does not have the point.

         I say to the Prime Minister: I have the table before me. It is not a hard thing to do: go to the top left-hand corner, read the first line and when you have done that you will get the point. You should then read the second line, which states, `Deviations from baseline'. You should read the second line. You have to get the point. Murphy did not say that GDP would reduce under the coalition's package; he was talking about deviations from a baseline.

         . As the Prime Minister sees it, all of this debate is about the totality of what we are doing: unemployment is going up, inflation is going up, interest rates are going up, the economy will contract, and all hell will break loose if people vote for the coalition. Murphy did not simulate the totality of the package.

         When Murphy went on air this morning, and when he issued his press release last night, in one stroke he completely demolished this man, this great pretender, this arrogant, abrasive, insulting Prime Minister. The truth of the matter is that Murphy looked at one small part of the package and came up with some results on a very technical basis against a deviation line. If we ask Murphy, `What is the bottom line?', even if we look at the little bit that the Prime Minister is so excited about, the bottom line is that it is good news for the economy, a benefit over time.

         One can look at the deviations. He reckons our package is of tenth order significance—a classic prime ministerial statement. He, of course, was one of the keenest advocates of this sort of change years ago. He came up with the figure of 4 per cent, but the Murphy figure was actually 0.04 per cent. We are in the worst recession in 60 years and this bloke is out by a multiplier of 10. No wonder we have a prediction that the Budget deficit is heading towards $9 billion and he is still on $5 billion. It is incredible. The only grace I can provide to the Prime Minister is that he does not even understand the significance of what ought to be a very simple point. There is no pressure on us. Was it not a classic line when he said, `This Opposition, it is on the back foot'—the classic Keating line? He is on the back foot. The best form of defence is offence, and very offensive he is.

         Yesterday we went through the Prime Minister's answer to the question that was put to him in respect of the Murphy modelling, to analyse what the Prime Minister was saying about the Murphy model in the closest possible way. I will make these observations available to those who want to scrutinise them more carefully. We came up with over 20 clear misrepresentations of the coalition's package. From start to finish, in about 10 minutes, he failed to tell the Australian people the truth about the one set of economic policies that really do provide this country with an alternative vision and a chance finally to get out of the recession that this bloke deliberately engineered and has the gall to boast about. He starts with, `The headlines show "Academics are a bit crook on the GST." I tell you what—by God they are'. Even that is not true. Murphy, in fact, reports that the great majority of support at the conference was for the indirect tax reform package, which essentially is what the GST is about. That is no surprise, because anybody who sits down and looks at the issue objectively will come to the same conclusion. He goes on to say:

        Murphy is a very good bloke, but as a matter of fact he did not receive from us a consultancy to use his model and to base and test the GST on that.

One of the bases upon which the Prime Minister builds his insubstantial case is the worst case scenario that Murphy modelled for the sake of, in his words, `logical completeness'—an absolute distortion of what Murphy says. I am pleased that Dr Murphy has crushed the Prime Minister on that point. I quote again from the Prime Minister's two answers in Question Time yesterday:

         , is that we provide the greatest support to those in the greatest need. This debate about the Prime Minister's misrepresentations is ironical because he uses Murphy, who worked for Access, who worked for us, to attack us—and he distorts and misrepresents Murphy—yet his own principal economic adviser, the top honcho in his office, has publicly acknowledged the progressiveness of our Fightback program. In other words, this man comes in here, with the advice of Treasury and his senior economist, knowing that our package does look after those who are needy in our society and has the gall to say exactly the opposite. I think he ought to be hauled before the court of public opinion and declared guilty of that constant misrepresentation. He said:

        Of course they will claim it in wages!
       </para>
       <para>
        I say that is a misrepresentation as well. I have quotes as long as my arm of the Prime Minister saying exactly the opposite back in 1985. There is to my knowledge not one reputable economist in the country who would really do otherwise than accept a simple proposition which is based on international experience. Subject to having a sensible package—which we do—inflation is not a problem. A GST is not inherently inflationary. That fact is well known amongst those who have studied this issue or who have seen its application internationally. In misrepresentation No. 23 he says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . we are about preserving low inflation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have dealt with that point. It reminds me of, `We're bringing home the bacon', which we hear every year from this bloke. The Prime Minister said in 1987, `This is the golden age of economic change'; in 1988, that he was bringing home the bacon; and in 1990, `I won't let there be a recession'. Then when we got one he said that we had to have one in the first place. After that he said, `I knew we had to have one, but I did not want to tell you that we had to have one'. Tonight he will say, `Don't worry; it is all going to be well. You vote for me. You support me. The recovery will be with us now'. That is simply not the truth.

         The truth for this country is that we have a lot to do by way of fundamental reforms to our economy. Sure, the economists are brought into the debate about what ought to be done but, quite frankly, most of the things that have to be done to improve our economic circumstances are obvious and are common sense. In most cases, our competitors made the changes which we now propose many years ago.

There is a chance. There is opportunity in the future of this country if you support the changes which we recommend'.

Members of the Opposition are the ones who promised to have a sensible debate about political and economic alternatives in this country but, at the slightest suggestion of criticism from anybody—not just from us—they do not argue the point; they attack their critics; they demean their critics; and they question the motives of their critics.

         We have seen two of the most paltry speeches ever associated with a censure motion in this House. A censure motion is a very serious device used by an Opposition about very serious matters. It is usually accompanied by serious minded speeches which actually go to the point of the political debate. But what was this censure motion about?  This censure motion was actually about the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had grasped some criticism of the Opposition's package—criticism which actually came from some of those who were associated with its description and who were responsible for looking at its effects on the economy—picked up on some of the results of this work and revealed to perhaps a surprised nation that the actual effect of a switch from income tax to consumption tax would actually have a depressing effect on GDP, a depressing effect on employment and an escalating effect on unemployment.

         This political apprentice who now leads the coalition on the Laws show the other day lamented that there was far too much politics in the political system. What he wanted was a bit more leadership—whatever that might represent. But what the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) displayed here today was the antithesis of leadership. If he wants to be a leader, if he wants to set himself up as the author of an alternative package, he has to be prepared to support it; he has to be prepared to argue the point; and, more particularly, he has to be prepared to take a bit of criticism.

         That is an example of his originality. But in the process of his annotation of what I thought was a pretty good answer from the Prime Minister, he gave us a string of just the kinds of misrepresentations that he himself and the Leader of the Opposition were complaining about. For instance, he said that, whenever he looked around the world to see what had happened in the wake of the introduction of a consumption tax of the kind that the Opposition has been proposing, he found that there had not been any inflation. I can tell the House that in those circumstances, where there has not been any increase in inflation, any inflationary pressures have been squeezed out of the economy by paralysingly high rates of interest, which is what the Opposition is really on about. That is the point which it will not come clean about. The one device it has to achieve any purpose which it pretends it can achieve is a result of using high rates of interest in order to crush any tendency towards wage increases. But what happens when there are paralysingly high rates of interest is that the economy becomes so depressed—

         The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders, went on to quote Dr Murphy. I do not want to get into any particular argument with Dr Murphy, but he did say on the wireless that it was wrong for the Prime Minister to say that there had been a reduction in GDP of 3 per cent. He said it should have been 7 per cent. He said that what had to be measured was not just the decline in GDP, as the Prime Minister referred to it, but also what GDP might have been had it not been for the recession. That is, had there been normal growth as opposed to a recession, what would the difference have been? Dr Murphy said the difference between the one and the other was 7 per cent.

We see then that the rate of growth which occurred as a result of our efforts has added something like $50 billion to GDP.

         Let us recall that over the last year or so there have been 11 reductions in interest rates. Who has opposed every single one of those reductions? There are no prizes for guessing that it was the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has opposed every reduction in interest rates that has occurred over the last year or so. What does he say now the proposition arises that maybe the Government has the room to apply a bit of fiscal stimulus to the economy—not fiscal stimulus which will be applied in a cavalier or capricious way, but a stimulus which will be applied in a sensible way, in a way which will in fact underpin sustainable growth and not simply exploit an opportunity capriciously? He says, `Of course, you cannot do that unless you fund it'. He has this notion of a funded stimulus: `Oh, you can spend a bit of money on job creation or on something else or on infrastructure so long as you save it somewhere else'. This is a very quaint observation about the way in which the Budget operates. Of course, there are some circumstances in which one could switch some form of expenditure from one activity to another, but the opportunities for that are very limited and are certainly not immediate. So what the Leader of the Opposition is saying is actually contradictory. One cannot have a funded fiscal stimulus in the circumstances which we are now contemplating.

There is no suggestion that these people might have the national interests at heart; there is no suggestion that these people might actually be interested in the Government doing something about providing jobs for the 800,000 or 900,000 people who currently do not have jobs and want them.

        . . . there is now a lot of volatility and instability in the World economy. And that severely constrains what a small trading nation like Australia can hope to do in the course of this decade.

        To find out what he really meant by that, we need to read what he said a little later:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        We have been there for a couple of years now and the World economy is slowing down. So it will mean a much longer period of recessed activity in Australia, much more economic hardship, much more adjustments to be made.

         That is what the Leader of the Opposition is really about. He has been going around Australia like some half-hearted sad sack talking down Australia and our economic prospects, simply because he does not want them to improve. It does not suit him for our economic prospects to improve. It is about time he started to discover some of the inherent strengths of Australia and the Australian people, some of the great successes that we have already had, despite our current difficulties, and some of the great advances Australia has made in the world and in the region. It is about time he started showing a bit of respect for the efforts that Australian working men and women and Australian management have put in over the last few years in order to make this a more robust economy, an economy which can now contemplate the prospects of more vigorous growth and, more importantly, of sustainable growth and better standards of living for the Australian people.

         I want to pick up two particular things that the Treasurer said. He likes to hark back, as does the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to the performance of the Fraser coalition Government and the fact that the period 1982-83 was dominated by a recession. I concede that 1982-83 was a period of major recession, but it is about time that the Government realised that during that period there was an all time record drought—a drought far exceeding the current drought, bad as it is—in many parts of Australia. It is high time, if he is to make those comparisons, that he allow for the truth of the matter: the drought of 1982 was devastating for Australian rural production and Australian export income and impacted on the recession when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer of this country. To argue otherwise is a total falsehood.

         The truth of the matter is that the Prime Minister made the mistake of partially quoting from a clipping without reading the underlying paper which was available to him. Even when he did try to read the underlying paper today, he still got it wrong, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) so conclusively showed.

Is the Government going to abolish the diesel fuel excise which costs Australian National $22m a year; State Rail New South Wales, $48m a year; Queensland Rail, $24m a year, and V/Line, $18m a year? As accurately pointed out by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), on top of that our rail system pays $130m on a diesel fuel excise and $128m on payroll tax, so they start each financial year $260m behind the eight ball whatever the Government decides to do in respect of rail tonight. Let us see that in its proper context. The Prime Minister has failed in his first real test on the floor of this House. He deliberately misquoted the Murphy papers and the ultimate umpire on this—Dr Murphy himself—has confirmed the case for the coalition. For those reasons the Prime Minister deserves the full censure of this House.

         In the past, when people have debated a goods and services tax, nobody has actually seriously got up and debated a goods and services tax as the way to productivity. Goods and services taxes and VATs were introduced basically in Europe because governments found them an easier way to raise money than increasing income taxes when they were supporting a very much larger state than we support here, or because they had to supply subsidies for the farming population of the European Economic Community. That is why they introduced those taxes. That is what VATs go to. Nobody has introduced a VAT in Europe because somebody has come along and said, `I have a really beaut idea to improve productivity and equity in this community.

         Recently I entertained a British Labour Party colleague who came to Australia. His surprise was to discover that the goods and services tax sought to be imposed by the Opposition was to be imposed on food, on babies' clothes, on vegetables, on school uniforms—on all of the things which are exempt in the United Kingdom. People there do not pay goods and services tax on them. Indeed, when Maggie Thatcher was invited—I repeat, when she was invited—to extend the goods and services tax to incorporate those things, she said, `Oh, no. These are the necessities of life for people. I don't do that sort of thing'. That is the position she found herself in when she came to look at the tax.

         The Leader of the Opposition has also had something to say about what we intend to do tonight. He alone amongst just about every conceivable economic commentator, bar one or two, has said that there is no room for any fiscal stimulus. He has said that if we are going to do some spending then we have got to pay for it. Fine. Dr Hewson, on your own criteria, there are one or two things that Dr Murphy did not mention about your goods and services tax but about which we need to know a few answers. That is, where Treasury and Finance have identified a $4 billion gap in your figuring, how do you intend to close it? It is Treasury and Finance which have identified that gap, not the Government. I think if we sat down and really worked our way through this politically we could find something a fair bit bigger than a $4 billion gap.

         If you were elected to government, next week you would put your policies before the Treasury and Finance departments and say, `Give us cost estimates of these'. They would come back and say, `Yes, Prime Minister Hewson. We have done cost estimates of these. You are $4 billion out. You are going to have to adjust policy'. That is what they would have to say to that. But we have not heard one word from the Opposition on the subject of how it would make up that $4 billion shortfall or whether it would simply cop it. If it is just going to cop it, what a pounding, thundering amount of hypocrisy those opposite have imposed on us in the nonsensical censure motion they have put up here today.

         This censure motion is as near as a censure motion gets in this place to being a joke. It is a running away from Question Time. It is a running away from serious issues in an attempt to turn this House into the common room of an economics department in a university. That sort of ridiculousness must be resisted by this House in defence of its own dignity. To give the House the opportunity to do that, I move:

        However, I received advice that section 44(iv) of the Commonwealth Constitution was an absolute, though anomalous, bar. The explanatory paragraph at the end of the section is regarded as overriding the concept of the `divisibility of the Crown' in which the High Court now distinguishes between `the Crown in right of the State' and `the Crown in right of the Commonwealth'. The final paragraph was inserted to cover transitionary arrangements on the establishment of the Commonwealth on 1 January 1901.

        —Some months ago in a speech to this House on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990, I made the statement that this Government's ongoing program of defence reform has aimed to give this country a military capacity consistent with our strategic position, our financial resources and our future needs. I made the statement following three years of detailed work by the Government in which our defence forces, our defence support networks and, indeed, our fundamental defence philosophies underwent a wholesale readjustment process.

        Work began in earnest with the Dibb report on the Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities, which heralded both the pulling to pieces of the colonial doctrines of the philosophies of the 1940s that branded our defence forces as an

        In mid-1990 the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) made a statement to the House regarding the results of a Government inquiry which has completed the process I have described. A defence force inquiry which was commissioned by the Government in May 1990 and which has been the most wide ranging inquiry in 20 years, covering every aspect of the defence question, has led to changes which will shape the Australian Defence Force to meet its operational requirements well into the twenty-first century.

        It has been an inquiry that has built on the foundations of related co-inquiries, such as the defence logistics redevelopment project, which aims to reduce costs and increase efficiency in the delivery of logistic support to the ADF;  the defence regional support review which has been examining the question of service-civilian arrangements; and the Interdepartmental Committee review of the report by Mr Alan Wrigley
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         The Defence Force and The Community: A Partnership in Australia's Defence
        </emphasis>
        . The inquiry looked in great detail at issues such as the structures of our forces, training and support, the role of the Defence Force reserves, defence expansion in times of potential conflict, our defence industry and exports and the role of the civil sector in defence support activities.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">

        In specific terms the key changes announced by the Minister include: increased naval basing in Western Australia;  increasing the Army's presence in the Northern Territory;  enhancement of the forward development strategy of the Royal Australian Air Force; closure and/or relocation of strategically redundant military facilities; giving a higher priority to civilianisation and commercialisation in many areas of the ADF; and creation of a new form of reserve service to be called the Ready Reserve program.

        As honourable members are aware, some aspects of the force structure review, as it is known, have already been the subject of a blaze of publicity, very little of which has been of a positive nature. I am sure that all of us in this House have read or have heard of some of the disinformation that is permeating the community, particularly the nonsense that has been hurled about in relation to the intended expansion of our reservist capabilities, the role of Defence personnel and civilians and the rationalisation of the defence operational and support arrangements.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        One must say that it is hardly surprising that some hostility exists in sections of the community which are directly affected by defence force rationalisation, such as the communities around the bases earmarked for closure: for example, the airfields at Laverton and Point Cook and the naval bases HMAS
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Nirimba
        </emphasis>
        and HMAS
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Platypus
        </emphasis>
        . It is certainly reasonable for communities in such circumstances to question the effect of the respective closures on their well-being, although I would hasten to say that it is perhaps a little premature for this feeling of concern. In the case of Laverton and Point Cook, it is only the airfields which will be closed down, not the associated facilities. I think it would be odds on that the airfields would be snapped up for commercial purposes. In all of the closure cases it should be remembered that the Government is conscious of the local sensitivities. The Minister for Defence (Senator Ray), has already said that community interests would be kept in mind during any sell-off process.

        The big disappointment that has accompanied the release of the force structure review has been the claim by certain vested interest groups that the whole exercise is about saving money and downgrading our defence capabilities. The major weapon of these disinformationists, many of whom sadly reside within the defence structure, is the claim that our Army is being partially decimated and replaced with pretend reserve soldiers. Likewise, we are hearing that millions of dollars of much needed prime defence property is going to be sold, training is to be cut back to the bone, and defence purchases wound back drastically. The inference is that the Government is promoting a second class defence capability.

        The review is now suggesting that we need to move on to the last step in the process—a movement towards higher levels of readiness so that we are able to respond to such threats when, and if, they arise. Irrespective of whether vested interest groups like it or not, the Government's intention to replace 10,500 ADF personnel progressively with reservists and civilians is an important part of the defence upgrading process. So too are the plans to reduce, through efficiency savings, permanent RAAF personnel by 1,800 and Navy personnel by 600.

        review have of course had a field day with cheap shots at the concept of reservist soldiers. They have pushed hard the message that Australia will have a defence force consisting of annual leave soldiers who will play soldier for a fortnight every year. Although I am inclined to dismiss such critics, as they are probably the same people who supported the purchase of aircraft carriers and the clustering of Australia's defence capabilities around Sydney and Melbourne—thousands of miles away from the real security threats which would have to materialise from the north—I believe it is important for us to understand comprehensively the rationale behind the upgrading of reserve capabilities.

        Firstly, we need to remember that there is no reason why the Reserve force cannot be of a first class standard. Just look at the Israeli, Swedish or the American Reserve records. Secondly, the ADF Reserve force will be far more than just a pretend army—it will be a professional army which will operate at two levels. Firstly, there will be a Ready Reserve force, of which 20 per cent of its members will be regulars. The Ready Reserve program will initially number some 4,100 personnel, of which 450 will be Navy, 3,200 Army and 450 Air Force.

        There will be two methods of entry to this force. Former permanent or trained current Reserve members will serve part time for five years. New enlisters will undergo 12 months full time training and then serve a further four years part time. The end result will be a force of well-trained soldiers who will be able to achieve operational status quickly in the event of a security call-out. Clearly, those soldiers will cost a great deal less than an equivalent force of regular soldiers. However, they will be just as potent.

        One should also stop to think that such a force will, in all probability, have a great attraction to many Australians who are prepared to help in their country's defence and could do with the extra money, but who prefer not to be tied down permanently in a Regular Army position. Ready reservists will have an annual part time training commitment of about 50 days, generally including two periods of two weeks. They will qualify for a large number of benefits, including tax-free pay and allowances of 85 to 90 per cent of permanent Army rates, superannuation, education assistance and a yearly commitment bonus of $1,500.

        There are some matters canvassed in the ministerial statement with which the Opposition agrees. They are, for example, certain aspects of the civilianisation of the armed forces, cuts in the number of non-combatant personnel within the ADF structure, and some elements of the proposals relating to base rationalisation. But if this report is adopted in its entirety, the Opposition holds grave concerns about the future of the ADF reserves—not only the existing Reserve components in each service, but also in particular the new form of Reserve service referred to as the ready reserves.

        The statement of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) certainly raised many important questions about the future role of the reserves, but, regrettably, has not provided many acceptable answers. As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I participated in the wide-ranging review of the Reserve component of the Australian Defence Force recently undertaken by the Defence subcommittee. This review included a comprehensive examination of the possible alternatives to the present Reserve structure.

        During the 18 months that the subcommittee spent studying the Reserve component of the ADF, the arguments put forward in support of the Ready Reserve concept were far from convincing. Amongst other things, the Committee concluded that the Ready Reserve program may operate as planned in terms of its recruitment and manning targets in each of the three services.

        Whilst the establishment of a Ready Reserve may offer economic savings for the Government, there is little evidence to suggest it will provide any military gains or benefits. In fact, there are strong indications that the Ready Reserve will effectively and significantly limit Australia's defence capabilities. In the final analysis, the anticipated savings may not even be achieved. As the shadow Minister for defence science and personnel, Senator Newman, has pointed out, when it comes to the bottom line we may well find that we are paying more and getting less. Instead of being an asset, it may well prove to be a very real liability.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Minister is understandably reluctant to explain how the Ready Reserve will actually enhance our military capability. The reason for his hesitancy in this regard is obvious: he cannot provide the necessary explanation, because he knows the idea just will not work.

        According to the ministerial statement, two of the key principles adopted by the force structure review were to maximise the combat capabilities of the Defence Force and to maintain the required overall force readiness levels.

        The Minister has indicated that the Government intends to reduce the number of Army battalions from six to four and is seriously suggesting that the Ready Reserve can fill the gap. The Opposition does not accept that the Ready Reserve will be able to effectively replace these two significant battalions. There is no proof or logical argument in support of the Minister's contention that a regular unit, training and working with the armed forces on a full time basis, can be replaced by a part time civilianised Ready Reserve. Irrespective of training or resources, it is just not possible for a part time reserve service to adequately fulfil the demanding role of full time defence forces. There is no doubt that the combat capability of the ADF will be reduced as a consequence of the decision to replace regulars with reservists.

        In regard to maintaining overall force readiness levels, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) pointed out in his response to the ministerial statement, there will inevitably be significant delays between a decision to mobilise all or part of the Ready Reserve and its availability to be deployed on operations. Delays, even minor delays, in operational readiness, which for a number of reasons do not apply in the case of the regular forces, may be crucial in the context of the resolution of an unexpected crisis in which military involvement is required.

       Australia's role in international politics is continually changing. The end of the Cold War has made Australia's region of defence interest less stable and certainly less predictable. Both the former Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) have said that under a new world order Australia will have to consider regional as well as national defence issues. Our military capability must change with the changes in our foreign policy. Our defence policy and our foreign policy must share a common direction. We must recognise and acknowledge the influence of the one upon the other and ensure that the one is responsive and able to adapt to the other.

        As Australia's role changes and we more fully develop our involvement and responsibilities in regional affairs, we must be prepared to accommodate additional demands on our defence forces; for example, the provision of peacekeeping forces. At present, one such force is serving in Cambodia. Mr Michael O'Connor, Executive Director of the Australian Defence Association, has warned that when our troops are deployed offshore in this manner, the capability of our Regular Army to defend Australia is significantly undermined. We simply do not have sufficient manpower to adequately fulfil both roles. It is quite clear that the Ready Reserve concept will further erode Australia's already limited capability to actively participate in any role except that of defending our own national security. Even their effectiveness in this regard would be very doubtful.

        Questions have also been raised about possible legal constraints in regard to calling out the ready reserves in times of national crisis other than war.

        Capability, adaptability and operational readiness are not the only problem areas. Another significant question arises in regard to long term recruitment prospects. Despite claims to the contrary by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), the present level of interest generated by the recently launched Ready Reserve recruitment campaign does not indicate that the scheme is a success. The Minister knows that the initial response is largely due to other factors. The current high youth unemployment rate, together with the deplorable reduction in tertiary education opportunities, has forced young people to examine options that they would usually never bother to even contemplate. Realistically, albeit very unfortunately, at present the prospect of serving with the Ready Reserve is for many young people a last resort rather than a first choice.

        Not only does the Opposition reject the Government's argument that the Ready Reserve can be developed sufficiently to replace two Regular Army battalions; there are several other aspects of the proposal that are causing some concern. For example, the problem of the conventional reserves still remains. With the introduction of the ready reserves, the role of existing reserves will be diminished. They will become less important in the overall scheme of things.

Already the existing reserve forces are starved of resources. They lack equipment and access to adequate and appropriate training facilities. Morale is generally low. Attrition rates are unacceptably high. This situation will almost certainly be exacerbated by the creation of the Ready Reserve. The existing Reserve is a very capable force which has, unfortunately and inexcusably, been sadly neglected by this Government.

If that will to win is sapped, then we are indeed in danger. In my view, that will to win can be instilled only in a community that has unity, equity and prosperity.

        The next step is to look at what we need strategically in Australia. In my view, these needs are quite small:  all nations need a degree of medicine, and because of the nature of Australia we need surveillance, communications and transport expertise. All these are areas in which Australia has shown expertise in the past but all are sadly underdeveloped and neglected. If we are to have a meaningful defence force and a meaningful defence capability we cannot ignore this fact any longer, for the best trained army in the world will not survive long if it does not have that sort of support.

        I would like also to draw attention to the incursions on Australia, for these too pose a threat. If these incursions are allowed to go unchecked or if Australia is seen by the world to be weak and not to act quickly in response to these incursions, they will continue. I was personally terrified when I saw the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on television talking about immigration. He said that when the economy improved he would vastly increase immigration—in my view a very foolish policy—but then compounded it by saying, `If we don't, somebody will do it for us'. I admit that there are people in my own Party who think this way, but to hear the Leader of the Opposition giving away Australia's sovereignty so glibly I think is terrifying.

The reality is that, if we do not take a stand, sooner or later we will be confronted with not 30, 40 or 50 but thousands of people—perhaps 10,000 of them on a steamer—steaming into Darwin harbour and saying, `Here we are'. It is conceivable that, in the changed circumstances of the world, our neighbours could rattle their sabres and say, `You have to take these people because to do otherwise would be racist'.

An idea was put to me some years ago, and again recently, which I believe has some merit.

I believe Australia could gain a lot by looking into the available literature on lighter than air aircraft. I believe they have the capacity. I am also told they are in fact very hard to shoot down. The Zeppelin had 16 compartments. It could lose quite a few of those without losing lift. It was in fact a very hard vessel to destroy, except for the fact that hydrogen was very flammable.

The British made us an offer to joint venture a thing called the TSR2, which was an excellent aircraft.

        This statement is unusual in that it has resurfaced, thereby allowing us the opportunity to debate its contents, albeit nearly 12 months later. In this sense it could be said that the statement keeps bad company. It was made by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on 30 May 1991. Honourable members may not remember that until yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had not spoken a word in this House since 29 May 1991, when he spoke on a matter of public importance. So this statement is not alone in having disappeared from the proceedings of the House, only to make something of a miraculous appearance nearly a year later.

        The ministerial statement is the outcome of a force structure review designed to meet Australia's defence requirements until the end of the current decade, that is, the end of the century. The review was designed, we are told, to achieve several things. It sought to improve the cost effectiveness of the Australian Defence Force through the rationalisation and commercialisation of Defence Force activities. It sought to facilitate the reorientation of the ADF's strategic focus towards the north and west of the Australian continent through the redeployment of some units. It also sought to make greater use of reserve forces, again in the search for greater cost effectiveness.

        The review resulted in some very important changes to our defence policy. These changes make a significant contribution to the achievement of the three objectives sought by the Government's force structure review. It could not be said, however, that the review makes any great contribution to the enhancement of Australia's defence capabilities or to our overall national security. In fact, the review glosses over some of the serious problems with the Australian Defence Force and makes some changes to the force structure of the Army, to which the coalition is seriously opposed.

        The overwhelming sense one gets from this ministerial statement is that defence policy is being driven by budgetary considerations rather than by consideration of our overall defence requirements. Of course, we can only defend ourselves on the basis of our national resources, and under this Government those resources have been declining for six consecutive quarters. But it is fair to say that defence has borne a disproportionate share of the burden of fiscal restraint in recent years. This is undoubtedly because the defence forces are severely constrained in speaking out publicly against government policy. This makes them easy targets for budget cuts, coupled with the fact that only the defence forces feel the effects of those cuts.

        Defence spending is currently at historically low levels. There has been virtually no real growth in the defence budget over the last few years. In 1987-88 we actually had negative growth in the defence budget of 1.8 per cent. It is interesting that Bill Cole, in his annual analysis for the Institute of Public Affairs of possible Federal Budget cuts, invariably excludes defence as a candidate for spending reductions. Defence planning and Defence Force operations have been consistently undermined by the failure of the Government to provide adequate funding as set out in the defence White Paper of 1987. Do honourable members remember it? The defence White Paper stated that defence spending would need to be set at between 2.6 and 3 per cent of GDP in order to meet the basic defence requirements set out in that document.

        At the same time the Government's five-year defence program has consistently failed to meet its forward projections of real growth in defence spending of between 2 and 3 per cent. There is now a shortfall of some $2 billion between the White Paper funding projections and actual defence budget outcomes. Clearly defence is being severely short-changed by this Government.

        The failure of the Government to meet projected spending requirements has not stopped the massive capital equipment purchasing program that has taken up a large proportion of the defence budget in recent years. This has meant that economies have had to be made elsewhere. The number of days spent training, personnel numbers and defence stocks have all suffered cutbacks in order to keep the capital equipment purchasing program on schedule. There has been a resultant loss of operational readiness and combat effectiveness in the ADF to the detriment of Australia's security.

        Despite these shortfalls this ministerial statement presents yet another list of large capital expenditure items to be funded in part by the savings to be made in other areas of the defence budget.

        A major failing of this Government's approach to defence has been its inability to provide a stable funding base for the ADF. Nevertheless, many of the savings that will result from this force structure review are to be welcomed. They are savings that will result from rationalisation of various Defence Force operations, contracting out and civilianisation. Targets for commercialisation include catering, stores, transport, clerical support, non-military training, repairs and maintenance, communications, health care and firefighting. These are all activities that can be performed more cost effectively by civilians in the private sector, and should never have become military functions in the first place.

        These are developments which have close parallels with moves overseas by Western governments to rationalise their defence establishments in the light of changing economic and strategic circumstances. The United States has recently embarked on massive rationalisation of its armed forces and the facilities which support them. New Zealand embarked on a similar review of rationalisation in 1989. The British Government also is currently undertaking a defence review which it has given the title `Options for Change'. That is not necessarily to endorse everything that has come out of these foreign developments, but merely to make the point that there is common interest on the part of Western governments in making best use of available funds for defence.

        Certainly, the Defence Department should not be exempt from micro-economic reform. Indeed, defence has arguably been insulated from such reform measures for many years since it has often been regarded as a special case in debates over public policy.

        However, savings in the management and other non-combat functions of the Defence Department are fundamentally different decisions from those we make about the structure and capabilities of the defence forces. These should be set according to our defence requirements ahead of any budgetary consideration. It is disturbing then to see changes being made to the force structure and capabilities of the Defence Force for budgetary reasons with little regard for the impact of these decisions on our defence requirements. I am thinking in particular about the decisions to reduce the number of Regular Army combat battalions from six to four, and the Government's new Ready Reserve concept. These two decisions are linked in that it is the intention of the Government that the Ready Reserve should compensate for the scaling down of the size and capabilities of the Regular Army.

        There are a number of political and legal constraints on the use of reserve forces which will compromise Australia's security if we rely on reserve forces too heavily.

There are also operational problems in making use of reserve forces at short notice. United States national guard forces performed very poorly, I understand, in the Gulf war last year.

        If we are to rely more heavily on reserve forces, we must demonstrate a greater willingness and a greater capacity to mobilise those forces if and when needed. The Government has rightly rejected the Wrigley report's proposals for a citizens militia as being too risky; but the Government's ready reserve concept demonstrates similar weaknesses. The Government gives no indication that it has given serious thought to these problems.

        It is an inescapable fact that the strategic environment in which Australia finds itself today has changed radically since 1987. It is difficult to set out reliably the implications of these changes as the world is in a state of flux. But this does not obviate the need for analysis, especially on the part of this Government. However, the Government has shown little desire to think about these changes, at least not within the context of the defence portfolio. The Government continues to rely on the 1987 Defence White Paper for its defence guidance. Even if we had not witnessed some of the profound changes in the global strategic environment, this would be an inadequate approach because the White Paper has always been deficient in terms of strategic guidance.

The White Paper can accommodate those changes and anything else the world might throw at it because it was so bereft of content to begin with. We clearly need a new strategic guidance document to take us into the twenty-first century.

        I would mention just one of the apparent mistakes that has cost Australian taxpayers dearly: the Defence Department, through one of its senior officers, insisted on the need for a Shell filling station facility at St Mary's Munitions Works. That was constructed at a cost of some $10m, but I understand that the facility will never be used. It has been completed and is locked up; it has never been and will never be used.

Australia will continue to receive support from our allies, including access to advanced technology, intelligence and emergency resupply. I do not know whether we can always depend on that happening because of commitments by our allies to other theatres of war that may eventuate from time to time. We must plan on carrying out our primary combat tasks ourselves. The Gulf war has not changed these fundamental assessments, nor should it drive our force structure decisions.

        In 1941 I happened to be working around the Laverton Air Force Base, which was then in its infancy. The American Air Force had very modern aircraft which were stationed there, but we were still carting goods from the railway station by Army horse and cart; we did not even have trucks in those days. That leads one to think that the forward thinking in those days was inward and certainly not outward.

        Notwithstanding these efforts, and despite what Defence Ministers may have said in the initial stages of this debate in May last year and since, it needs to be recognised that our naval effort, although modest, could not have been sustained had operations been escalated to a shooting war at sea and then prolonged without United States logistic support. Our land and air forces, had they been involved, would not have fared any better. That indeed is very pertinent to the debate before us.

        I suggest that developments since have reaffirmed those views. We have seen one of the most prestigious joint standing committees of this Parliament table in November last year a most damning report into defence force reserves, which flies largely in the face of the statements of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) just six months earlier in the debate. We have seen the farcical, uncoordinated and ad hoc nature of our coastal surveillance effort being highlighted in Montague Sound in the north-west by the so-called Chinese boat people several months ago. We have seen media reports in recent weeks of the euphoria of the commissioning of the first Australian built FFG, HMAS

        The basic problems are these: the funding expectations created by the 1987 Defence White Paper have not been fulfilled; operational exercises have been cut back; operational capability has declined; training and exercise opportunities have been allowed to run down; personnel wastage rates have been high and costly, particularly amongst officers and at the command level and other specialist ranks; the reserve forces have been neglected shamefully and are in divided disarray; a morale problem amongst defence personnel exists; and, finally, some defence management practices remain outdated and highly inefficient.

        In a nutshell, there is a perception by many within and outside the defence machine that defence policy has lost direction. While we should not draw invalid lessons from the Gulf war, one thing is clear to me and to the Opposition: the strategy that underpins the 1987 Defence White Paper and its defence policy is questionable, particularly the concept of warning time as a key ingredient in defining defence preparedness and our national ability to respond quickly to other than a regional incident. Even in regional terms, our operational capabilities during the 1987 Fijian emergency highlight our serious operational limitations.

        The Government has done nothing to redress these since other than to persist with the line that the White Paper remains a valid cornerstone of its national security policy. In particular, our commitment to the Gulf war started to focus public attention on some of the real limitations of our defence capabilities. In some quarters—this is a view I share—there has been a basic question mark as to whether the 1987 White Paper was written so that it meant all things to all people. The result is an uneasy compromise between competing strategic and financial views. However, I would suggest that the White Paper now poses bigger problems for this Government. Although the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) will not bring themselves to admit it, many of the underlying strategic assumptions have been overtaken. More significantly, it has locked the Government into a multi-billion dollar capital equipment purchasing program despite its failure to live up to the Budget allocations which the White Paper identified.

        The consequences are that other areas of defence spending, particularly manpower and operating costs, have to be squeezed to pay for the equipment. This is a real reason for this force structure review. The Opposition rejects the comments of the Minister for Defence that its approach to defence policy making is both ad hoc and contradictory. Instead, for example, those opposite should be looking at their own Government's sorry record in its high priority aim of coastal surveillance and its head in the sand approach to the security strategy which underpins its outdated 1987 Defence White Paper. Defence Ministers need to bite the policy bullet on both.

        Clearly, the previous Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister for Defence were poles apart in their public utterances on these points. The most recent boat people incursion, and its aftermath, cannot be restricted to criticism of the Australian Customs Service or Immigration authorities. Other Federal Government departments are involved, not the least of which is the Department of Defence. I agree with my colleague, the shadow Minister for defence science and personnel, Senator Newman, that the Government's so-called high priority for coastal surveillance as part of its defence strategy has failed, and failed very badly.

The Government cannot continue to sit back complacently and depend on the strategy that underpins the 1987 Defence White Paper.

        What the force structure review confirms is that the promises made in the 1987 White Paper cannot be met. What is required is a new White Paper which addresses all the elements of our defence policy in a sensible, coordinated way. That means addressing the strategic situation and force structure implications as well as the budgetary situation. The force structure review comes as a deep disappointment to all those who had hoped for a statement that would make defence planning more predictable and that would be more directly related to the changes in our regional and international security. In the event, it is an inadequate response to the critical situation in which our Defence Force finds itself. The Government strategy is neither credible nor affordable.

        On the other hand, the Opposition is approaching the issue of force structure in quite a different way from the Government.

Wait for it: we will not be getting into the game of ad hockery or of endorsing or amending any of the aspects of the uncosted equipment shopping list which the Government has produced in this structure review.

        The point I wanted to get across is that I am somewhat surprised at the view taken by the honourable member for Groom.

        It is a matter of historical record that within the British armed forces there were people who made other social choices in terms of whom they cohabited with. Whether or not that interfered with the operation of the armed forces is another matter, but some people in the defence forces believe it would not. I find the honourable member's view surprising. The honourable member was correct in what he said about health concerns and coordination of the unit. But it does not require a torrent of interjections to overcome the point I am making, which is that in the past it was operationally effective. Some people may be able to produce evidence to show that it was not.

The Dibb report did that remarkably well and it made a very significant contribution to Australia's defence approach.

They felt that they really had vessels that, in terms of their capability, were well suited to that task. We really have to focus on these realities.

        There is something I should say. I think my colleagues opposite would accept this. I was really alarmed to learn that the Australian defence forces cannot receive Radio Australia during Gulf deployment. We know the position taken by Radio Australia at the time of the Gulf War, which I think was unacceptable. Families in Australia could not use Radio Australia to broadcast messages to members of their family deployed in the Gulf. I thought Radio Australia's initial attitude was an extremely short-sighted one. It did, however, respond in the end.

        I am also alarmed that Radio Australia cannot be received by the defence forces in the Gulf on a regular basis. Quite frankly, the members of the crew were all news hungry. They wanted to know what had been happening in Australia, they wanted to know something about Australian sports results, they wanted news and so on. This really highlights the inadequacy of Radio Australia. If I can be honest, I think it comes back to the Government to consider whether it is going to further resource Radio Australia to improve the quality of the transmitters and to ensure that Radio Australia provides an effective service for people overseas.

        I was particularly alarmed—and I say this to the honourable member for Groom—to find out that apparently expatriates have a very low priority in Radio Australia's allocation. Frankly, that is appalling, because after all Australians are the ones who pay the taxes for Radio Australia. Radio Australia costs approximately $13m annually. It takes many of its feed broadcasts from the ABC and from pooled resources. For Radio Australia to mount a bigger operation, particularly for our defence forces, would be a remarkably good service. The Americans and the British can expect radio broadcasts when they are deployed overseas; our service personnel should also be able to. Again, I find it appalling that expatriate Australians are given third priority in the list after Radio Australia has served other purposes. I find that unacceptable, particularly for defence forces which rely a great deal upon communication.

        The commanders of those ships did say to me that one of their priorities was to ensure that they gave as much information as they could to their personnel. But Radio Australia could do that relatively easily without a great increase in cost. It is something that we as a Parliament should be pushing to do. We should certainly be pushing to change this absurd rule that expatriates remain low on the list of priorities for service. I do not think  Australian defence personnel should be treated as third class citizens in terms of communications in this respect. It is an issue I will continue to press.

        The honourable member for Groom mentioned the question of coastal surveillance, which I want to take up because it is very close to us in Western Australia. Clearly, in relation to coastal surveillance Australia is in an enormous predicament. First there is the large area required to be patrolled and there are the difficulties in terms of actually mounting effective surveillance. In my view, many effective operations are performed in the region, particularly the north-west of Western Australia, but I would be foolish to accept that the situation was ideal. It is not, and I believe that an increase in resources is required.

In my view we are better placed than we were in the past, but I still do not think that, given the changes in our region, we can accept or expect that we can simply under-resource the issue. I believe that it needs an increase in resources. It is certainly an issue in Western Australia, but I believe it is a wider issue than that.

His name is Reg Davies, and he is a member of the upper House in Western Australia. He was telling me with great satisfaction about the work that he did in developing Aboriginal recruits into Norforce in Western Australia. That sort of exercise is to be commended because it proved to be very effective, certainly in terms of the difficulties that some of those communities experienced. It was able to give them focus and pride in their work, and I believe that we ought to recognise the worthwhile work that is being done.

        There are a couple of other observations I wish to make. The other major thing we ought to observe is that the world in which the honourable member for Groom learned to operate as a serviceman has changed dramatically: that is, the notion of a Cold War with two over-arching superpowers, where one could predict within limits the outcome of certain conflicts. The Gulf war showed that, if an authoritarian figure such as Saddam Hussein is prepared to stop at nothing to achieve his ends, in the end we have to rejig the world so it can come to terms with coping with that eventuality. In that case we had to get the United Nations to move before we could get world cooperation. That situation will not disappear. We cannot assume in the future that it is a question of getting on the hotline telephone from Washington to Moscow, or Moscow to Washington, and resolving a problem. That will not happen in the future. What we have to understand is that we now need a new circumstance for dealing with those conflicts and eventualities, and I believe that is important.

        Another point we all ought to be aware of—it is one that worries me, and we have raised it with officials in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation—is the question of an arms bazaar that is resulting from the breakdown of the former Soviet Union, now called the Commonwealth of Independent States, where clearly all the member states are strapped for money. Their economies are in a mess because of the mismanagement of the previous administration. It is with great concern that one must wonder what will happen, first of all, to the dispersal of conventional weaponry, particularly if it was to find its way to the Middle East and, secondly, what will happen with the nuclear scientists—about 100,000 of them—who have been employed in previously Soviet projects related to the nuclear program. What will happen in terms of their deployment? If they were to find themselves working for people such as Saddam Hussein or Gadaffi, I believe the world would be at some risk.

That contract provides for nine ammunition loaders and fuse setters for the Anzac frigates, to be built between 1994 and 2003. The equipment will automatically feed ammunition from the below deck magazines to the frigates' 127 millimetre deck mounted guns.

        Australian Defence Industries in Bendigo is looking forward to being successful in obtaining further contracts under that Anzac frigate contract. It is quite clear to me that the quality of workmanship at Australian Defence Industries is of the highest class not only in Australia but on an international level. In this particular contract it was able to compete on quality, efficiency and price, and Australian Defence Industries was playing a major role in equipping Australia for a solid, reliable and trustworthy defence capability within Australia.

        Just recently Australian Defence Industries has embarked on an upgrading of equipment and has moved into the twenty-first century with equipment which is used in the production of components for defence vessels. That equipment can also be used for other major boat building contracts.

Sometimes when people do not have the opportunity to visit a plant of that nature, all sorts of fears and misrepresentations may come into the debate about that plant. I am sure that when people visit and see the type of work that is being carried out there and are able to assess from their own view just what is being achieved to improve Australia's defence capability, they will get a great deal of assurance that Australia needs that defence capability and needs to keep it at the ready.

        Another example I would like to give to the House about moving into the twenty-first century and the future of defence relates to the Australian headquarters of the Army Survey Regiment, which is also established in Bendigo. It is a very self-sufficient group. In fact, it is responsible for the production of maps and charts for the defence forces. Many of those maps are produced by the Army Survey Regiment based at Fortuna Village, which was previously owned by George Lansell, who was known as the quartz king in Bendigo. The regiment is housed in a magnificent old home which dates back to the 1800s and is built on top of many gold mines. Lansell built his home alongside the gold mines and the stamping mills so that he could hear the mills going in the middle of the night and know that more gold was being stamped out. It has a wonderful history. I am delighted that the Army Survey Regiment is expanding its presence in Bendigo at that site. It has taken great care of this building.

        I think the whole of the Defence Force and the defence Reserve units have a great desire to reach a very high level of professionalism. Recently I saw this professionalism in action when I visited 15 Transport Squadron, which is located is Bendigo. I went to the advanced driving facility at Monegeetta, not far out of Melbourne, and saw the squadron in action in the high level of training given to the transport operators. I had the opportunity of joining with other local civic leaders on this open day at Monegeetta to see the dedication of the Reserve forces and the type of training that those people were prepared to undergo. Many of them do this as a purely voluntary service to the community and to their country.

        The recently formed Ready Reserve, whilst a noble idea in theory, still neglects the real needs to take Australia's defence capabilities into the twenty-first century. Until the recent force structure review, our Army could muster six regular infantry battalions and 15 reserve infantry battalions. Most of these units are under strength. The reserve battalions are badly equipped and at the moment are not receiving sufficient training. In addition, the six regular battalions will be reduced to four, by converting two of them to reserve units manned by the new Ready Reserve. I do not believe that this is adequate for Australia's defence purposes. That means that since 1972 Australia's first line of defence, the regular battalions, has been more than halved from nine to four.

I think it is a tribute to the working men and women of the factory that we had that display. They have certainly gone through a process of dramatic change. Not only are they serving the Defence Force and meeting its needs, but they are also undertaking quite a wide variety of commercial work and they are winning work both in defence and commercially against stiff competition.

As I did in Bendigo, I wish to record the nation's appreciation of the service of all those who have worked at the factory in that period of 50 years. The ADI factory has undergone some quite dramatic changes. I certainly wish them well in the future.

Certainly, my colleague from Bendigo was seeking a bipartisan approach; I wish we could take a bipartisan approach to defence.

        It is true to say that the Labor Government has really undertaken the hard work in defence by tackling issues. If one talks to officers they will say that this is a period of challenging change which they are accepting and meeting head-on. In terms of tackling the difficult issues, I give no better example than what we had to do with the Office of Defence Production. It was grossly inefficient; it was not commercial or competitive. We had to corporatise it. We had to go through a lot of pain in terms of structural changes, but the benefits are starting to come through.

We have made an enormous commitment to the Australian Defence Force and its capability by doubling the acquisitions budget.

        What has been the effect of that? We have lifted Australian industry participation from 40 per cent to nearly 70 per cent in that major capital acquisitions program. That is an outstanding contribution. We have done this for Australian industry by providing preference for local content. We have specified the scope for contracts on specified work; for strategic reasons, we have had to engage Australian industry to supply these goods; and we have used defence offsets. I believe we also have a good record in the area of exports. We are encouraging the export of Australian military products wherever possible. We are starting off from a very low base. Last year it was something like $160m. I believe that we will be able to do more.

        The Opposition mentioned coastal surveillance in a defence context and the recent incursion on the north-west coast of Western Australia. I think it is to be regretted that the honourable member for Groom, a former serving officer, raised that matter. Firstly, as he would know, the Department of Defence is not responsible for coastal surveillance; that is a matter which falls within the jurisdiction of my colleague the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall). Secondly, it occurred in an area which has absolutely no strategic military value at all. Thirdly, looking at the small number of people who made that incursion, and given the difficulty of the terrain and the desperate plight they were in when we were able to find some, but not all, of them, what is the military significance?

        In Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1991-92, appropriations totalling $5.3m additional to those made in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1991-92 are sought for recurrent expenditures of the parliamentary departments. The increase sought relates primarily to essential and unavoidable costs associated with activities of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. I commend the Bill to the House.

         The first of these initiatives is a one-off payment of a family allowance bonus to all those in Australia who receive a routine family allowance payment on or in respect of 2 April 1992. The bonus will be an amount of $125 for a family with one child; $175 for a family with two children; $200 for a family with three children; $225 for a family with four children; and $250 for a family with five or more children. A one-off amount of $125 will be made for each child in an approved care organisation who attracts payment of family allowance to the organisation on 2 April 1992. The family allowance bonus is payable only to those whose family allowance is usually paid to an account in Australia or otherwise is paid in Australia.

Speaking in terms of the current legislation, the intention is to increase from 15 per cent to 16.2 per cent of the combined pensioner couple maximum basic rate the benchmark used in indexing family payments in respect of children aged under 13 and from 20 per cent to 21.2 per cent of the combined pensioner couple maximum basic rate the benchmark for indexation of family payments in respect of children aged 13 to 15 years on 1 January each year.

         The third initiative involves the abolition of all rent assistance waiting periods for social security recipients except those waiting periods which apply to single beneficiaries without dependent children who are aged below 18. In the 1991 Budget it was decided that the existing 26-week waiting periods should be reduced to 18 weeks as of 20 March 1992. This new decision supersedes the 1991 Budget decision for all except those aged single beneficiaries under 18. Some beneficiaries will still serve a de facto waiting period where the standard one week waiting period or other longer waiting periods for payment of a social security benefit are involved.

         This package of social security measures continues this Government's proud record of increasing social security and veterans' payments required by those most in need. This package is a compassionate response to the current recession and will help to stimulate economic activity by injecting $317m into the economy in April. Ongoing extra expenditure will be $65m for the rest of the current financial year, $290m in 1992-93, $301m in 1993-94, $299m in 1994-95 and $304m in 1995-96.

        (1) I have been advised by the DPP that it appears there may originally have been five warrants for the apprehension of Mr Manners obtained in 1984 and 1986. These warrants related to Mr Manners' alleged involvement in taxation fraud. Two of the warrants being Victorian warrants were withdrawn when Mr Manners was advised in August 1990 that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions withdrew its request for his extradition. Mr Manners was advised in October 1990 by the Associate Director that as far as the Office of the DPP was concerned all criminal proceedings against him were at an end. He had earlier been advised through his solicitors in similar terms by the Melbourne Office of the DPP in September 1990. It would appear from records of the former Special Prosecutor's Office that there may be three inactive warrants issued from the Queensland Magistrates Court. Despite enquiries made of the Brisbane Magistrates Court the Court has advised that they have no record of any outstanding warrants.

        (3) In the 1990 Budget, the Government announced a package of reforms to provide a more certain and efficient basis for offshore petroleum production taxation and to encourage efficient exploration activity in Australia. The reforms which took effect from 1 July 1990, replaced the excise and royalty regime on the Bass Strait project with the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) and introduced full deductibility against the PRRT for all company exploration expenditures in Australia's offshore areas outside the North West Shelf exploration permit areas WA-1-P and WA-28-P and the associated production licences.

      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The production based excise and royalty regime was inhibiting the enhanced development of the mature Bass Strait fields. The crude oil excise had evolved over time into a complex range of rates that varied according to annual production levels, and the timing of the discovery and/or the date of development. These arrangements discouraged full economic development of the Bass Strait reserves. In contrast, the PRRT obtains an equitable community return from the Bass Strait resource without inhibiting economic development because it is levied on net income rather than production and is therefore sensitive to changes in prices and costs. All production costs are deductible. Following the reforms, a further $1-1.5 billion is expected to be invested in Bass Strait, generating an additional 200-300 million barrels of oil and enhancing gas production.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Company-wide deductibility of exploration costs against the PRRT encourages the broadening of Australia's exploration effort. Previously, deductibility was limited to individual permit areas; as a result, for a company, after-tax exploration costs were lower in a PRRT paying permit area than in prospective but relatively unexplored areas. The change to a company-wide system equates a company's after-tax costs for exploration in all PRRT offshore areas.

        Note: that from 1987-88 added duty also applied to `old' oil if the crude oil price increased above a threshold price. Added duty effectively increased the top marginal tax rate on a sliding scale up to 80%. If the threshold price was reached the top marginal rate was increased by an added percentage.

        It is the Authority's aim to inspect approximately 25% of all foreign flag vessels over 500 gross tonnage calling at Australian ports in any year. This figure accords with established international practice. The procedures employed for the inspections are in accordance with International Maritime Organization resolutions. Resources have not enabled the target level to be achieved in every year.

        These inspections are carried out on a random basis on all types of ships visiting this country. They ensure such things as ship certification, manning levels, crew qualifications, hull structure, life saving appliances, fire fighting and navigational equipment, load line and radio equipment comply with the standards of the relevant convention.

        Inspections were implemented on 1 April 1985. A system for the formal recordings of port state control data was not introduced until early 1986. As a result, the records prior to that are incomplete.

        The control provisions of the international conventions confine the port state to inspection of the validity of certificates issued under the relevant conventions unless there are clear grounds for believing that the condition of the ship or of its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of the certificate or has not been maintained so as to conform with the convention requirements. In order to ensure the integrity of the inspections and to establish "clear grounds" the instructions require marine surveyors to record all departures from convention standards as "deficien-

       cies". It follows that a considerable number of deficiencies recorded during such inspections are of a relatively minor nature and do not pose an immediate hazard to the safety of the ship or its crew. In many such cases the deficiencies may be, and are, rectified by ships' crews during the normal stay in port, without delay to their schedules.

        The decision on whether specific intervention action, eg detention of the ship or refusal of outward Customs clearance, is warranted as a result of a deficiency is a matter for the judgement of the individual surveyor on the basis of all of the facts of the case. The Authority's data base does not permit identification of the seriousness of the deficiencies and thus the statistics show all deficiencies found during inspections.
