              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Patrick moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to the Biosecurity Amendment (No Crime to Return Home) Bill 2021.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've not sought the grace of the Senate to immediately consider a bill before, and I would not do so except in exceptional circumstances. The exceptional circumstance and the reason why we should be dealing with the bill this morning is that on 1 May the Minister for Health and Aged Care made a high-risk country travel pause determination under the Biosecurity Act, making it a criminal offence for distressed Australian citizens to return home from India.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't say we should open our doors and just let everyone come back in without any sort of quarantine or any measures put in place. My bill does not seek to prevent the exercise of other existing powers under the Biosecurity Act to require persons, for example, to quarantine on arrival or to go to a particular destination. It doesn't stop any of that from occurring.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are a bunch of Australians out there who would say: 'Tough luck. You left the country. You shouldn't be able to compromise our health.' I know that that sort of sentiment is driven by uncertainty and fear. I understand that. But we shouldn't be losing our compassion and our humanity in relation to our Australian friends and neighbours.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:</span>  Senator Patrick, I am listening carefully and I do remind you your contribution really needs to be around why you consider the bill urgent or not urgent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator PATRICK:</span>
                  </a>  Sure. I'll go to exactly that at the moment. Last week it was revealed that there are 173 unaccompanied Australian children in India who are affected by the determination. If we don't deal with this determination this week, that will continue. Not only that; there is a possibility that, throughout this pandemic, the minister could extend that determination. The minister could make a new determination that is similar. It's important to understand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night I read through the explanatory memorandum of the Biosecurity Act around section 477, which is how the power is being exercised in these circumstances, and there was nothing in there that suggested in any way, shape or form that that particular act would ever be used to prevent an Australian from returning home. We're in a situation where a determination that wasn't foreshadowed has been made. So, the urgency in dealing with this is the fact that a right has been taken away that the parliament never intended to take away. That's the problem we've got here. That's why we need to deal with this issue urgently. We have had a determination made that is not disallowable, so the Senate can't use its normal processes to deal with this determination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I checked the explanatory memorandum last night, and the reason for not having these determinations disallowable was that they were going to be determinations that were based on technical and scientific requirements. This doesn't go anywhere near that. This is about the removal of a right for an Australian to return home—to criminalise an Australian's return home. That was never the intention of a non-disallowable instrument under the bill that was debated back in 2014. So there is absolute urgency in dealing with this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wasn't in the chamber yesterday when Senator Fierravanti-Wells talked about this determination, but I did read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>this morning. She made it very clear that these sorts of determinations are quite dangerous—where the parliament has no oversight over the exercise of a power. So I am now forced to come into the chamber and seek to expedite the passage of my bill through this chamber in order to deal with a situation that should never have arisen under the bill that was originally presented to this parliament. I invite people to go back and have a look at that explanatory memorandum. I invite them to have a look at the debates. The exercise of this sort of power was never mentioned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to deal with this bill. I'd love to be able to do it by way of disallowance. I'm unable to do that, and that's the reason we should be dealing with this bill this morning.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:36</span>):  I rise to contribute to this debate on the suspension of standing orders to consider Senator Patrick's motion, and I indicate that the Greens will be supporting the suspension. We believe this is a matter of urgency that needs to be dealt with now. We also believe amendments need to be made to the Biosecurity Act. People may recall that earlier in the week I circulated an amendment to the biosecurity bill that was supposed to be coming to this place after being dealt with by the House of Representatives. We thought that was a way we could deal with this issue, by amending that bill, which would of course amend the act. However, that bill hasn't come on for debate, so that has not been able to occur; hence our support for the suspension of standing orders to discuss this bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind this chamber that there are 9,500 Australians and permanent residents stuck in India who wish to come home. They were devastated when the ban was put in place but even more devastated when, overnight, on a Friday night, the minister chose to put in place and announced criminal sanctions on people returning home. That was a further devastation for those people, a reminder of those 9,500, including 950 vulnerable people, 173 of whom are unaccompanied minors. I'm sure everyone in this place has heard the very tragic accounts of parents separated from their children. They need to come home. I can barely imagine being one of those parents who heard about the ban and then the criminalisation of their child's potentially coming home. That's why this is urgent. Although the Prime Minister at the moment is saying, 'Oh, yeah, we'll have three repatriation flights and maybe a few more,' there's nothing to stop him enacting this again and making it happen again. That is why this is urgent. That is why we will be supporting the suspension of standing orders, to ensure that this situation does not occur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That takes me to the points Senator Fierravanti-Wells made yesterday, reinforcing the concerns that the Greens have had for a long time. I used to be a member of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, as Senator Rice is now. This issue has also come up, repeatedly—that is, legislation that is coming through with instruments that are not disallowable. It is an outrageous way to govern this country, when ministers—and prime ministers—can make decisions that cannot be questioned and that we cannot come into this chamber and seek to disallow. When you're getting something so momentous as banning 9,500 people from coming home, of whom 950 are vulnerable, which means they need urgent support and attention, that power should not be put in the hands of a minister. That's just one example; there are a whole lot of other instruments that are not disallowable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Increasingly, it's the trend of government to move to putting in place instruments that are not disallowable. This is certainly one. I commend Senator Fierravanti-Wells. I don't often commend Senator Fierravanti-Wells, to be honest and open, but on this one she's right. We shouldn't be governing in this manner. In some legislation there are a few principles, but there's not much meat on the bones and everything else is through regulatory instruments, increasingly many of which are not disallowable. That's why this is urgent. It's so we make sure that the Prime Minister doesn't change his mind again to stop people, particularly those in India—citizens and permanent residents—from coming home. It is absolutely critical. The situation in India, we know, is critical. That is why this debate needs to be had, and that's why we'll be supporting this motion to suspend standing orders to bring on this bill.</span>

However, decisions in relation to Australia and decisions in relation to legislation remain in the purview of the government. The idea that Senator Patrick, with the support of the Greens, would seek to come in here and decide that he himself is the one who decides how this chamber is operating—there is a process—sort of surprises me. Senator Patrick has always been one of the people who have been particularly consistent in understanding the processes and the procedures of this chamber. I understand that Senator Patrick is a great respecter of the processes of this place and respects this chamber. So I find it quite surprising that he comes in here today and decides to rearrange government business. </span>

We also take our responsibility in relation to all Australians very, very seriously. We will always make sure that we operate in the best interests of the health and safety of our citizens, because there can be no more important thing that a government can do than to protect the safety of its citizens and its country. We will continue to do so. But we will continue also to defend the right of the government to determine the operation of the business of this chamber. I'm sorry, Senator Patrick, but I think this is, once again, a stunt. I'm particularly disappointed because I know how widely held your views on convention are in this place, and for you to come in here and seek to abuse that I find quite surprising.</span>

Why I think this is important is that, yes, India is going through a pandemic, but the courts ruled on this and they threw it out. It was not breaking the constitutional rights of the people; it was for health reasons. It's exactly the same—the premiers didn't open up the state borders for exactly the same reason the courts have ruled. They supported the government on its stance.</span>

Senator Patrick has always been exactly the same: he has always looked at the procedure of the chamber and government business.

But this motion would see the introduction of a bill for debate that would see the Senate override the advice of medical experts, and that is not the Senate's role. The only way we can bring home the 40,000 stranded Australians, including from India, is for Scott Morrison to finally roll out the vaccine here in Australia and accept his responsibility to safely expand Australia's quarantine capacity so that all Australians can again call Australia home.</span>

First of all, let's be honest: Liberal Party, you have failed so far. We've got just over 2½ million vaccine jabs on the road, so we're miles behind on that. It's not just Australians in India. We're now 15 or 16 months into this and we've still got stranded Australians who want to come home from countries that have now got COVID under control, and we still can't get them home. That is a failure of the government. You still have not set up places to quarantine them so that we can get them home. It really has been a failure, and, for that, they're paying the price.</span>

We will not do that. I'm sorry that there are Australians overseas, whether they're in India or not, but now they're going to have to pay the price. They're going to have to pay the price, if they're there, for the sake of everybody else. I do apologise. I know what you're saying. This is about jailing Australian citizens. Well, I'm telling you right now: I don't think threatening them with jail was a good idea, but, if you want to come home and put other Australians at risk, when there is no need to put the other 25 million of us at risk, you've got to weigh it up.

Although the current measures are due to expire on 15 May, it is quite possible for the minister to roll them over and to continue to attack the rights of Australians to come home. Citizens of Australia being able to return to their home country is a fundamental right. That is what is at stake, and that's what there has been ministerial override of.</span>

We feel very strongly that it is not. The minister has acted in a way to disallow people coming home, to block the borders and to keep Australians in India, where they are becoming sick and dying from COVID. Australian citizens are dying because they are not being allowed to return home to Australia. This is absolutely an urgent issue that we must address, because there are Australians who are dying in India because of the actions and failures of this government.</span>

I do not understand why the federal government has not accepted its constitutional responsibility to deal with quarantine. All this government needed to do was to actually act as a federal government to put appropriate quarantine facilities in place so that Australians would be able to return home, but it has refused to do that. It seems that it's refused to do that because it's left it up to the states so that, if things go wrong, it can blame the states.</span>

                  </a>  It's urgent because people are dying, and it's urgent because this measure that the government has put in place could be rolled over in just a few days time. It is critical. This is our last day here for a month, and we know that there's the possibility that this government could just roll over this issue and keep Australians away from home—lock them out from home—while they are getting sick and they are dying in India. Isn't the fact that people are dying one of the most urgent things we could possibly be considering here? The fate of Australians who should be able to come home is why this is urgent. That's why we need to be discussing this today. The Morrison government has failed to put in place appropriate quarantine facilities. If we don't discuss this motion today, what pressure is there on the federal government to actually put in place the appropriate quarantine facilities? If we don't discuss this today, we will just go on, for another few months, basically blocking our borders to Australians—blocking Australians from their constitutional right to be able to come home.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is absolutely urgent. This is absolutely right at the core of what this Senate should be discussing, because this Senate is here as a watch on government. We are here as a chamber to oversight what happens. We are here in control of our own destiny. This legislation is entirely appropriate for discussion today; it should be discussed today. We need to have measures in place so that we can keep Australians safe. We need to have measures in place that allow appropriate quarantine facilities. We need to keep the pressure up on this government to set up quarantine facilities like Howard Springs right across the country to allow Australians who are in India to come home. If we don't, then it is on the heads of this government when more people die.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to finish up by saying we did not put measures in place like this when COVID was racing through Europe. The only reason this measure has been put in place is because it is India—because this government does not see Indian Australians as Australians; it sees them as Indians. This is a racist measure that this government has put in place. It is impacting upon people who are of Indian heritage and— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, Senator Hanson and I are passionate about developing the northern part of our country. The 2015 government white paper clearly articulated the unique challenges facing our north. It's a no-brainer. Consider these things: long distances; highly variable weather, with more extreme weather in cyclones; services; shortage of services; and reliable and accessible infrastructure—which we simply take for granted here in the south. There are no economies of scale in the north, and they have smaller populations and plenty of communications blackouts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In spite of the best intentions, a big pot of money and all the knowledge required to develop a robust fit-for-purpose infrastructure fund to meet the needs of the north, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility has not been fit for purpose. As a member of the Select Committee on the effectiveness of the Australian Government's Northern Australia agenda, I repeatedly felt disappointed to hear witnesses across northern Australia stating that getting money from NAIF was impossible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Northern Australia is operating from a lower base than in the south. The foundational pieces that we take for granted here in the south—all-weather road access, reliable internet and access to a skilled workforce and highly qualified professionals, be they in the trades, engineering or medicine—are not readily available across northern Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">NAIF needed to be adding value to northern development at a grassroots level, yet missed that target altogether. It's significant that, for a 20-year development horizon, the first five years have been far from optimal. We welcome the changes included in this legislation, but the ground lost during the last five years was an unnecessary opportunity cost and loss of momentum. The government had all the information it needed to have made better decisions from the start. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A more accessible NAIF is not the only element, though, that needs to be addressed. It's ironic that the issues that need addressing to facilitate development in the north are systematically being dismantled in the south due to atrocious federal and state governments. For example, energy, land tenure and water access and price are severe problems and hurdles in the north. How the hell can these be addressed and solved with policies currently destroying energy, destroying water access and raising water prices, and destroying land tenure in the south? The problems in the north cannot be solved with these destructive policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's wonderful to have NAIF improved, but we need to get the governance in this country fixed. The core issue suppressing development in the north is atrocious state and federal governance. People, their talents and resources are being suffocated under the stifling morass of bureaucracy inherent in the interference, overlap and duplication of government agencies, state and federal. Until this poor governance is addressed, the good work that NAIF can bring will be diluted and development in the north will remain painfully slow, to the whole country's detriment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to the next review to see how quickly and effectively this last $2.5 billion brings northern Australia along with the rest of the country. We will be support being this bill, especially given the deadline of 30 June for the changes, and we will be closely scrutinising all amendments. We will not be supporting racially based amendments. We will improve assistance to the people in the north, and I point out some of the comments in my dissenting report to the Northern Australia agenda inquiry. We will be balanced and measured, but we will always ensure responsibility is with the right people.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McMAHON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:16</span>):  I rise to support the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Extension and Other Measures) Bill 2021. The NAIF has been an important vehicle for a number of Northern Territory enterprises, and I am advised that there are potentially another 50 proposals from the Northern Territory in the NAIF pipeline at the moment. In the Northern Territory, NAIF is providing nearly $700 million in loans through investment decisions and conditional approvals to infrastructure projects, supporting over 1,500 jobs. The Northern Territory projects supported by NAIF so far include: supporting economic growth through the funding of a new ship-lift facility in Darwin; expansion of facilities at Humpty Doo Barramundi, helping to grow the Northern Territory aquaculture industry; upgrades at Northern Territory airports to increase capacity and support export industries; and improved infrastructure at Connellan airport, operated by Voyages, supporting tourism for the Yulara region and supporting Indigenous enterprises. I want to talk about some of these projects in more detail shortly, but let me first turn to the amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will help further turbocharge this government's investment program for northern Australia and make it easier for projects to receive funding and generate economic development and jobs, as the country emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the 2020-21 budget, our government announced reforms to the NAIF to provide more flexibility, to increase risk appetite and to widen the scope of eligible projects. This is in addition to the 20 July announcement, which extended the NAIF's operation until 30 June 2026. The proposed reforms seek to address stakeholder criticisms of the NAIF, regarding it being risk-averse and not providing enough, and follow recommendations from the statutory review of the NAIF.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The following are the proposed amendments to the NAIF Act 2016. The time period in which NAIF can make investment decisions will be extended by five years, to 30 June 2026. Given that we have approximately 50 projects in the pipeline from the Northern Territory, this is an extremely important change from the Northern Territory's point of view. It will accelerate lending. The amendments will also allow NAIF to lend directly to proponents under certain circumstances.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This option for NAIF to lend directly to project proponents will simplify the lending process and reduce administrative burden. Currently all NAIF loans are made through the relevant state or territory jurisdictions. While the state and territory governments remain important stakeholders for NAIF, the ability to lend directly empowers the NAIF to move projects to contractual close faster, so projects can get on with creating jobs and developing the north—which is, after all, what this is all about. This change also permits the NAIF to establish on-lending partnerships with local financiers to improve access to NAIF finance for smaller project proponents. Those partners will have the expertise to work with smaller proponents to demonstrate their suitability for NAIF finance and will extend the NAIF's reach to those smaller projects that need added assistance in these economically challenging times.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like you to note that the Select Committee on the Effectiveness of the Australian Government's Northern Australia Agenda, chaired by opposition shadow minister Murray Watt, recommended that the reforms that were recommended by the statutory review be passed by the parliament as a priority in 2021. Other relevant info on NAIF's investment includes that total NAIF investment is now at approximately $2.9 billion. This $2.9 billion is generating $9.4 billion in economic benefit across northern Australia, including a forecast of more than 9,000 jobs. In Queensland more than $1 billion has been committed across 10 projects. In Western Australia more than $1.1 billion has been committed across eight projects. In the Northern Territory more than $697 million has been committed across seven projects.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government in general is investing $9.3 million over the next five years, from 2021-22, to pilot regions of growth in northern Australian locations. These pilot regions are: mine and produce to port, Mount Isa to Townsville; agriculture, aquaculture and manufacturing precinct, Cairns to Gladstone; strategic gas basin, Beetaloo Basin to Darwin Port; and north-west agriculture corridor, Broome to Kununurra to Darwin. We're also improving digital connectivity, with $68.5 million for a dedicated northern Australia round of the Regional Connectivity Program and the Mobile Black Spot Program, including $41.4 million for the Regional Connectivity Program and $25.1 million for the Mobile Black Spot Program.</span>

The investment will be supported by a 'strengthening northern Australia' Business Advisory Service. This shows the commitment of this government, our side of politics, to those of us who choose to live, work and contribute to Australia's economy in the north.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, let me go over what this bill is doing for the NAIF. It is going to extend the investment period for the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility by five years, which is important for those 50 projects in the Northern Territory that are in the pipeline and whose survival will depend on investment. It will expand the functions of the NAIF to include the provision of financial assistance to projects that contribute to northern Australia's economic and population growth and it will amend certain governance and administrative processes of the NAIF.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me mention some of the projects that the NAIF has enabled so far. One of my personal favourites is Humpty Doo Barramundi, a family owned business. Bob and Dan Richards are two of my favourite human beings in the Northern Territory. The story of Humpty Doo Barramundi is rapidly becoming one of the great success stories of the Northern Territory. As I mentioned, Bob Richards and his son, Dan Richards, have been driving this project for the past 28 years. In fact, Bob likes to say to everyone who will stand and listen that he is an overnight success story that was 28 years in the making. Humpty Doo Barramundi is 100 per cent Australian family owned and operated, from a farm located halfway between Darwin and Kakadu National Park. Since 1993, they have farmed premium saltwater barramundi on the Adelaide River. I think it's fair to say that the Northern Territory is the spiritual home of the barramundi.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Humpty Doo Barra is on a journey that began as a pioneering barra farm back in 1993. The annual harvest has grown from 300 kilograms in its first year of sales to over 3,000 tonnes of barra per year today. The success of this business has been through trial and failure followed by improved processes of research, trial and error and passion from a unique team of people. This has led to recognition as a premium producer of great-quality farmed barramundi. These guys have set themselves the target of becoming a world-leading barramundi farm, utilising technological advancement, with increased opportunities for training and employment in northern Australia in aquaculture, one of the world's fastest-growing industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you this about them: when COVID struck last year and restaurants all around Australia closed down, they were struck extremely hard, with no outlet for their produce. This didn't deter them. They set out to develop other markets, which they did. This included selling through supermarket chains, something that they hadn't done before. During this period, which was extremely tough for the family, they did not lay off or cut back the hours of any of their employees. They care for their employees. They are passionate about what they do, and they managed to keep their business running through what were extremely trying and difficult times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How does this fit in with NAIF? As I've said, these guys were helped by NAIF and probably wouldn't be where they are today without investment from NAIF. They received a NAIF loan—the first NAIF loan—of $7 million in 2018. This was also matched by the ANZ bank. The result of that loan saw the business successfully deliver increased capacity for barra aquaculture at their farm and increased employment, as well as a new hi-tech nursery facility, introducing a higher level of care for the fingerlings, the baby barra, before they enter the grow-out ponds. Then these guys at Humpty Doo Barra invested a further $48.4 million in aquaculture infrastructure with a new loan through NAIF, matched again by funds that were loaned through the ANZ bank. Dan said at the time:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This loan will take us further down the path of making Australia self-sufficient in saltwater Barramundi production, plus secure our supply of Barramundi through a purpose built Barramundi hatchery.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As Australia's iconic fish, demand for quality, Australian saltwater Barramundi is growing. We aim to meet that demand through improving our facilities to provide the best growing conditions, leading to a healthy, great-tasting fish.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister for northern Australia said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NAIF loan, alongside private bank co-funding, will support the construction of a purpose built hatchery for saltwater barramundi that will provide a significant boost to the Northern Territory's aquaculture industry and generate economic activity in the Territory as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This latest round of funding through NAIF will support around 110 jobs during the construction phase and a further 160 jobs when the new hatchery is up and running. 'NAIF support will ensure Australian farmed barramundi will be available in restaurants and at home and around the world,' Minister Keith Pitt said at the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the type of facilitation that NAIF provides, and it is why it is so important to the Northern Territory. A hundred and sixty extra jobs may not sound like much, but, in the Northern Territory, where we have a very small population, it is extremely significant—as is the income generated by the export of farmed barramundi around Australia and, potentially, around the world. This is the sort of life-changing economic support that NAIF can produce across northern Australia, where it is so vitally needed. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DODSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  I rise to speak on the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Extension and Other Measures) Bill 2021. There is no doubt that the NAIF is in need of urgent reform. Its operation over the last six years is indicative of the failure of this government to deliver, especially for the people of northern Australia. It is symbolic of the pattern of announcements without follow-up or follow-through that has become the hallmark of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleagues who have spoken before me have highlighted, by October last year the NAIF had released only $218.4 million of its $5 billion budget—$218.4 million out of a $5 billion budget. Fewer than 10 projects have begun or completed construction. Only two First Nations projects have received NAIF support, and communities in northern Australia, particularly First Nations communities, are calling out for investment, and not just any investment but investment that is smart and sustainable, and investment that encourages prosperity without destroying culture, land and resources for future generations—in other words, a balanced approach to development. The NAIF represents an opportunity to achieve these goals, but it has fallen far short of that expectation to date. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege of being part of the Senate select committee investigating the effectiveness of the government's northern Australia agenda, which was chaired by my colleague Senator Watt and has recently handed down its final report—and I recommend the report to all in this chamber. The committee spent two years investigating the impact of government policies across communities in the north, including the NAIF itself. Despite being hampered by COVID-19, the committee travelled to Cairns, Townsville, Thursday Island, Darwin and Nhulunbuy, and we heard video evidence from many more other places across the north, including my home community of Broome. We heard from community groups, entrepreneurs, local governments, chambers of commerce and First Nations organisations about the challenges facing northern Australia. And what was our conclusion? It was that this government is stuck in the slow lane when it comes to northern Australia. There are no roaring engines going forward here. The failures in relation to the NAIF are just one example of promises not being delivered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's interim report reflected that, while there is support for the idea of NAIF, the reality has been profoundly disappointing. We've heard numerous criticisms about the complexity of the application process for NAIF funding. The administrative burden of applications is considerable, and it is no surprise that this has stymied First Nations projects most of all. The NAIF is simply not accessible for many First Nations entrepreneurs and organisations. Evidence submitted to the committee highlighted the many barriers faced by First Nations seeking to access NAIF funding, from the lack of liquidity equity to the inability to afford administrative costs and lack of credit history. This means that northern Australia is not benefiting from the innovative development led by First Nations. It also means that First Nations peoples are being left behind, despite the burgeoning wealth of some in the region. The committee received a report by Professor John Taylor, who studied the impact of the mining boom on social indicators for the Pilbara Aboriginal people. His research found that 'in many respects, outcomes are worse now than they were before the mining boom'. As representatives of the eight traditional owner groups in the Pilbara noted 'there has been a failure to "raise all boats" on the back of massive government and private sector investment in the region'. This will not improve without better engagement with First Nations peoples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we debate this bill, it is important to note the extent of the First Nations presence in northern Australia. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples make up approximately 15 per cent of the population of northern Australia and over 25 per cent of the Northern Territory population. The First Nations land tenure covers a vast proportion of the northern Australian land mass: 66 per cent of northern Queensland, 80 per cent of the Northern Territory and 94 per cent of Western Australia. Given this context, it is unthinkable that the future of northern Australia could be charted without the involvement of First Nations peoples. The government's white paper on developing northern Australia acknowledged that 'developing the north will need to be in full partnership with Indigenous Australians'. But this government has demonstrated again and again that it does not understand the concept of partnership with First Nations. Defenders of the NAIF's current structures point to the procurement and employment opportunities for First Nations peoples arising from the NAIF funded projects. While these opportunities should undoubtedly be strengthened, they are poor substitutes for First Nations being able to control and direct projects in their own right and a poor substitute for being assured a seat at the NAIF decision-making table.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill includes a number of amendments that federal Labor has called for for many years. We hope it marks a step in the right direction, but we also think we can do better to ensure both that First Nations people are truly benefiting from the NAIF and that the projects it funds are sustainable in the age of changing climate. To this end Labor will move a number of important amendments to the bill, which my colleague Senator Watt has outlined. One of these amendments would ensure that there is a First Nations member on the board of the NAIF. The government's current proposal is to add experience in economic development in Indigenous communities—that's the category—to the list of experts sought for the NAIF board. This is simply too weak. We must relegate to history the days when others speak for First Nations, particularly as they are property owners. I've outlined the amount of property they have in northern Australia. Labor's amendments are simple measures that would mean that First Nations peoples are assured a seat on the NAIF decision-making table. That is consistent with similar requirements that apply to a range of other federal bodies, including the Australian Heritage Council and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Valid concerns have also been raised about the effects of this bill on the north Australian environment, particularly whether projects funded by the NAIF will help or hinder us in addressing the serious impacts of climate change. Bear in mind that First Nations peoples in the north are likely to experience the brunt of harmful climate change or any other form of pollution of their lands and waters. We are already seeing these impacts across our communities, and nowhere more stark than in the Torres Strait.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's action has eroded any trust that they will be doing the right thing when it comes to managing the necessary transition to clean energy. We saw that in the extraordinary decision of Minister Pitt just last week to veto NAIF funding to the Kaban wind farm near Cairns, against the express recommendations of the fund. So Labor will be moving amendments to ensure that the minister cannot allocate funding in a way that is inconsistent with Australia's achievement of net zero emissions by 2020. These and other Labor amendments are straightforward, sensible proposals that will make this legislation better. I urge the government and all in this chamber to support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is considerable beauty and potential in northern Australia; much of it is fragile and unique. This time of the year is one of the best times of the year in northern Australia. Let me tell you: I look forward to going home to Broome next week. Much of its manifestation is in the richness of the First Nations cultures, its languages, its knowledge, its relationship to the land and its willingness to share some of that, if you don't destroy it. The NAIF could be a vehicle to harness this potential for the benefit of the whole of Australia. But it is currently failing to do so. It's up to the government and Minister Keith Pitt to deliver on the promise of the NAIF. This bill represents a second chance. Those of us on this side of the chamber will be watching this closely, and we will also be listening continuously to hear how people in the north are benefiting from the actual release of funds rather than its promises.</span>

The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Extension and Other Measures) Bill 2021 is only going to make it worse. It's such a pity. Infrastructure is so critical, and appropriate development of northern Australia is so critical. There are such opportunities for ecologically appropriate, socially appropriate, economically appropriate development to occur in northern Australia. In a better world with a better government we would be able to set up processes to facilitate, encourage and support that type of ecologically, socially and economically appropriate development. But the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund is not the vehicle to do that. It has already been shown to be a failure. It is already not directing investment to where it should be directed, and it is clear, from the amendments to the act that are being put forward in this bill, that it is only going to get worse. Rather than having a facility that ensures that investment goes to appropriate developments, this is going to set it up as a slush fund for the government to fund their mates, to invest in the most inappropriate developments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially, the government are climate denialists. We are in a climate crisis. The world is in a climate crisis. The No. 1 global priority needs to be to work out how we, as a global community, shift out of burning polluting coal, gas and oil. Governments all around the world are tackling this big problem. Governments all around the world are committing themselves to working in the interests of the globe by urgently slashing carbon pollution to zero as quickly as possible—but not this government. This government, in this bill today, is saying that it wants to provide 'flexibility' to deliver for the Northern Territory and northern Australia. But, translated, what this means is that this government wants to deliver for its mates, the big fossil fuel companies.</span>

It's very clear, from the statements that the minister has already made, what he wants to see the NAIF being used for. Keith Pitt, the resources minister, as we know, is a climate denialist; he does not understand, support and accept the reality of climate change and climate change science. He wants to see the NAIF doing things like opening up more opportunities for the Beetaloo infrastructure financing. That is just going to be a total carbon bomb, as well as destroying huge amounts of wonderful Northern Territory landscape. The amount of carbon that fracking the Beetaloo basin will release is, on its own, going to significantly increase carbon pollution globally. This is exactly the sort of development that should not be going ahead. It's exactly the sort of development, though, that this government wants to see funded under the NAIF. With infrastructure, as I said, we really have the opportunity to support the transition to a zero carbon, ecologically sustainable, socially sustainable economy, and that's what the NAIF could be, but it's what the NAIF is not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go through some of the problems with this bill. There are four, basically. The first of the problems is that it's actually going against everything that this place is saying needs to happen, in terms of facilities like this: to maintain the independence and the ability of an organisation like the NAIF to make decisions on the basis of good information from the people who are advising them. Requiring the secretary of the department to be a member of the NAIF board is actually going to increase ministerial influence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've already seen that this minister has got form in terms of influence. We have had, in recent times, the minister, extraordinarily, exercising his ministerial veto to stop a project that the NAIF board had recommended. The NAIF board had recommended, in fact, the sort of project of which we, as Greens, say, 'Yes—this is the sort of infrastructure that government should have a role in, to help our transition to a zero carbon economy.' It was a wind farm that was going to be supported by a battery. It was going to create 250 jobs. It was exactly the sort of infrastructure that we need to be seeing here. There are massive opportunities in Australia for this sort of renewable energy infrastructure. Why did the minister exercise his ability to block this project? The only way you could see for the minister to decide to do this was on sheer ideological stubbornness, really, because here you had the board recommending this investment in a wind farm with a battery, and the minister, when asked about it, could not even bring himself to say the word 'battery'. He could not even accept that batteries actually might be the way of the future. We keep on hearing from the government side of politics: 'There are problems with the renewables. What happens when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow?' There are actually answers to that, and batteries are a huge part of the answer to that. You invest in a wind farm and a battery—</span>

                    </a>  Coal—exactly! Senator Canavan, I will take the interjection, because Senator Canavan has only just walked in the chamber and has actually missed the beginning of my speech when I have been talking about the need to transition to a zero carbon economy. And, sadly, maybe Senator Canavan doesn't realise that coal is carbon. Maybe he doesn't realise that the mining, the burning and the export of coal results in carbon emissions going up into the atmosphere. It's actually the sort of thing that we need to be avoiding. It's the sort of thing where around the world countries are saying, 'Sorry, Australia, we're not going to want your coal in the future, because of the amount of carbon pollution.' Other countries are recognising that the world is on a precipice, that we are facing an existential crisis because of our climate crisis, because of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Yet we have this government that is ideologically committed to delivering for their mates, to delivering for billionaires, to delivering for the big mining companies and not just continuing but expanding the burning of fossil fuels, expanding the burning of coal, expanding the fracking of our country and the burning of gas. That's exactly the direction that we just cannot afford to be heading in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to the problems with this bill, the first one is removing the independence, but the second one is removing the veto right of states and territories. Again, we're in a situation where the only way our carbon pollution is not worse than it is at the moment in Australia is because some of our states and territories are actually recognising that we need to cut our carbon pollution. Some of our states and territories are getting on board with that, and they have got far more ambitious targets for cutting carbon pollution than the federal government has, so in fact there is the potential for the governments of the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland to actually be listening to the science, listening to their communities and saying: 'We don't want these fossil fuel projects. We don't want the Adani coalmine, because it's going to be a carbon bomb. We don't want the fracking of the Beetaloo Basin, because it's going to be a carbon bomb.' This is what state governments should have the ability to say in the interests of their community and of their state or territory and in the interests of the world, to say that these fossil fuel projects should not go ahead. But no. This government is saying, 'We're going to remove the right of states and territories to actually have that say, that these projects shouldn't be going ahead.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third thing that this bill does which is a problem is it expands the funding mechanisms to get into riskier developments, and that's important, because we know that if you look at the risk of investing in fossil fuel projects they are incredibly risky, they are likely to be stranded assets in the future—so actually investing in investments that are not only problematic climate-wise but also problematic economically. But these measures in this bill would say: 'Forget about that. We're going to allow you to invest in riskier investments.' Again, it's in order to suit their ideological position, in order to suit the business interests of their mates, in order to suit the business interests of the big mining billionaires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth problem of this bill is of course it extends the NAIF for another five years, which means that all of these things can just go on for longer. Rather than coming to an end and rethinking what sort of investment mechanism you should have for investing in clean, green, economically and socially appropriate infrastructure—no!—we're going to get another five years of this climate-denialist, carbon-polluting, big-business-supporting approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do we do about it? We've got a number of amendments that the Greens are putting up, and I know there are a number of amendments that the Labor Party is putting up as well, that are basically saying, 'Well, you could have a NAIF that would work better, that we could shift to be actually delivering appropriately.' So I foreshadow that I am going to move a second reading amendment, which I really hope will get the support of the Senate, that says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the motion, add ", but the Senate is of the view that no public money should be invested in coal, gas or oil projects".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that the world's in a climate crisis, given that we know we must slash our carbon pollution and given that we know the science is saying we need to have at least a 75 per cent reduction in our carbon pollution by 2030 to have a hope of tackling the existential threat of the climate crisis, I think that's a reasonable measure. It's not saying, 'Close down every fossil fuel project in the country'; it's just saying: 'Don't invest in any more. Don't add to the problem.' We've already got a massive problem here in Australia with the amount of coal, gas and oil that we are mining, burning and exporting. This second reading amendment basically says, 'Just don't make the problem worse.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to cut our carbon pollution. I will keep on saying it because it is an existential threat that the world is under. Look at the Black Summer fires. Fires like that will become more frequent, more intense, more extreme and more widespread. Look at sea-level rises. A massive proportion of Australia's population lives within a couple of metres of the sea. A sea-level rise of one, two or three metres—tens of metres potentially, depending on how quickly the ice sheets melt—will have huge impacts on us. Look at the number of people who die in heatwaves. Look at the area of our country that is going to be unlivable. Look at the area of our country in which we're not going to be able to grow food. By the end of the century, we will not be able to grow wheat in virtually all of our wheat-growing areas. These are the realities of the climate crisis that this place needs to come to terms with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The community have come to terms with it. The Australian community know that we should not be investing in fossil fuels, that we need to get out of coal, gas and oil as quickly as possible. But the government are just doubling down. Why? It's because of their billionaire mates, their big mining company mates, the people who have so much power in our society. They're not listening to the community, to the vast majority of Australians who want some leadership from government. The community want government to lead by saying: 'Yes, we know we have to get out of fossil fuels and this is how we're going to do it. We're going to have a transition and we're going to invest in infrastructure that helps that transition. We're going to invest in wind farms with batteries. We're going to invest in solar farms. We're going to invest in electric vehicles.' But, no, we've got this ideological denialism that insists we go backwards as a country. We are the pariahs of the world, the absolute laggards. Everyone else is getting on with it, even conservative governments. Why aren't we emulating the UK government's carbon targets? We've got far more potential renewable energy than the UK. But, no, we've got this commitment, which is expressed through this NAIF bill and has been expressed through the budget this week, to saying: 'We are just going to keep on keeping on. We're going to keep on digging up and burning coal. We're going to keep on digging up and burning gas. We're going to keep on with our dirty internal combustion engines.' It is such a travesty, such a backward way in which this government is operating, and it needs to change.</span>

It's an even better honour, though, to confirm the continuation of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. This facility was set up six years ago by the government for an initial five-year period. When this bill, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Extension and Other Measures) Bill 2021, passes, we will extend that period for another five years. What is important about that is that it shows that the government—indeed, the Australian parliament—is in the north for the long haul.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have great opportunities to develop northern Australia for the benefit of Australia, and it is going to take a long time. It was right and proper to set up a new and innovative facility like this for a limited time at first to see how it went. But it's great to see that it will continue its life, I believe, with the support of this chamber because to build the north we'll need to be there for the long haul. We need to work at this over many years, decades even, to really accomplish the creation of opportunities in and the potential of northern Australia. The NAIF, the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility, is being extended through this bill because it is working. It is delivering major projects that are creating jobs right across northern Australia and benefitting the whole country. It now has made nearly $3 billion worth of investments around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I saw firsthand the impact of these investments. I was at Beef Australia 2021, beef week, in Rockhampton, and there a company called Signature Beef had a stall run by Blair and Josie Angus. Signature Beef is a great Australian company. They are in the process of building a new meatworks near Moranbah in Central Queensland. It'll be one of the first meatworks opened in this country for decades and it will be smack bang in cattle country in the Fitzroy Basin. There are more cattle in the Fitzroy than in the whole of the Northern Territory. It will be a fantastic opportunity for graziers right through central and northern Queensland to have an alternative for their product to be processed, especially in a way that keeps their ownership of the product. They want to set up a facility that will do what are called 'service kills' to allow graziers to process and sell their own beef with their own brand on it when it comes out the other end. It is a great project. They had a video of the building being funded by the NAIF. It's almost complete; without holding them to it, it should be opened in August this year, and then 80 people will have a job at that facility in Central Queensland, giving an alternative opportunity for people to find work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also the Kidston hydro project, which in the last couple of months has reached financial close. It's been a long process to get there, but that's a massively innovative project, costing almost $1 billion and creating hundreds of jobs in North Queensland. They are using an old gold mine to install a pumped hydro project which will help back up energy in North Queensland, a massive project also creating jobs and lower energy prices for North Queensland. There are other projects as well. Metro Mining is doing bauxite in Cape York. It will have substantial benefits for Indigenous Australians with employment in a mining industry there on the cape. One of the projects I'm most proud of, as a former northern Australia minister who ticked off on this, was the loan the NAIF has made to the Australian Aboriginal Mining Corporation. They are currently constructing Australia's first Aboriginal owned iron ore mine. It's a great outcome for our nation to see Indigenous Australians not just getting a job in the mining sector but also owning the mine itself: taking the business decisions, taking the risks, hopefully making the profits. Certainly, if the iron ore price stays where it is, they'll have no problem there. But they're making a go of it on their own land in their own country and building something for the long term for their peoples. That has been facilitated and come about thanks to the NAIF.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also the Kalium Lakes project providing the first production of phosphate products in a long time in Australia. It's producing a fertiliser that will help farmers to increase our food security, so we're not relying on imports. In the Northern Territory there have been fantastic projects at Humpty Doo. I think a barramundi farm there is going back for a second NAIF loan after the first one expanded its barramundi output. In Darwin itself there have been NAIF loans to expand the great port of Darwin, especially to help maintain more of our naval fleet in northern Australia. Further south in the Northern Territory there's been the investment in another Aboriginal corporation, Voyagers, to upgrade the airport near Ayers Rock, at Yulara, a fantastic initiative that will help attract tourists and grow their business. All these investments are making sense. They are creating jobs, they are building our nation and that is why it's important to extend the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility, so we can keep doing more of those things in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we should invest in northern Australia is not just for the people of northern Australia. Around six per cent of Australians, or just over a million Australians, live in northern Australia. Of course, it's important that they're looked after. They deserve to have money spent on nation-building initiatives in their part of the country. Just as we built the Murray-Darling, the Snowy scheme and the Kalgoorlie-Perth pipeline, we should also seek to have nation-building initiatives in northern Australia. It's important for those people, but it's also important for our nation, because the economic output of those six per cent of Australians—the just over a million Australians who live in northern Australia—represents around 12 per cent of our nation's output. So they punch above their weight. They actually produce double per person in terms of economic output than the average around Australia. That is because northern Australia is home to our nation's biggest exports. It is where more than half of our exports originate from. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More than half of the boats that leave our shores, making us money so that we can afford the things that we spent money on in the budget the other night, leave from northern Australia. Big iron ore vessels filled with red rocks from Western Australia help pay for public services. Those boats leave with lots of black rocks from Central Queensland, where I'm from, with the coal that helps us to pay the bills, making us the great nation that we are. Increasingly, big refrigerated boats that carry liquefied gas are helping to pay the bills for this nation. Of course, northern Australia is a powerhouse for our beef industry. There are plenty of grains and cotton produced in northern Australia. All of these products help our nation to pay its bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does a good business do? A good business invests back into those parts of its business that make the money. If you sat down in the boardroom and said: 'Where should we put our capex to manage the budget for next year?' You'd probably look at the parts of your business, the lines of business, that are actually making a profit and making money. You'd say: 'Okay, let's put more into those areas.' That's why as a nation we should put more into northern Australia: you get bang for your buck. There is so much opportunity there to build more dams, to capture the water, to grow more food and to expand our mining industries—our coal, gas, iron ore. There is a massive demand for all of these products throughout the world, and we produce some of the highest quality minerals in the world. We should focus on those.</span>

If she had actually read the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Act 2016—she says, apparently, she's the representative for northern Australia—she would know there's a map that's referred to in that act and that Brisbane is not in northern Australia. It's about 600 kilometres south of Gladstone, which is where the border is on the coast of Queensland for northern Australia. So that's a little bit embarrassing for Senator Waters.</span>

                    </a>  Sorry, I just saw Senator Waters get up. The Greens spokesperson for northern Australia, from Melbourne, Senator Rice, said that we should not invest in fossil fuels in northern Australia because it's all bad, it's terrible, and it's going to blow up the planet if we continue to do these things. What she doesn't understand and doesn't mention is that half of the economy in northern Australia comes from mining—50 per cent. Half of the jobs, half of the income, half of the cash flow, half of the tax revenues that we all take, down here, come from the mining sector in northern Australia. So if you move an amendment here that cuts off a big part of the mining and resources sector, and I'm including LNG as part of mining there—just to clarify—and say, 'No, none of that can be invested in,' you are cutting off half of northern Australia and you are completely limiting the opportunities for our part of the world where I live in northern Australia to grow and develop, because we have enormous opportunities to grow and develop our mining sector even further. We have enormous opportunities to grow and develop the coal basins of North Queensland, because people want high-quality coal around the world, and we have it. We have enormous opportunities to continue the enormous trade in iron ore that we have going out of the west. We have enormous opportunities to continue exports of gas, especially in the Northern Territory, where our country's first shale gas field exists in the Beetaloo Basin. Wouldn't that be a great thing for Darwin? It is a great port, it has great access to the Asian region but it doesn't have cheap energy at the moment; that field offers that. Let's hope it is developed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is the NAIF did get off to a rocky start; there is no doubt about that. It is hitting its straps now but it got off to a rocky start. One of the reasons it got off to a rocky start was that the Labor Party teamed up with the Greens to stop the NAIF investing in the Adani Carmichael mine. That was going to be a big project for the NAIF. It could have built the rail line out to Adani, it could have been built to a bigger capacity than is currently being built, but the Labor Party, with Jackie Trad in Queensland, with Bill Shorten down here, with everybody supine over there on that Senate side, teamed up with the Greens to kill any investment in a new rail line out to a new coal basin, the first coal basin that would have been opened in 50 years; that was taken off the table. Thankfully, the Labor-Green alliance wasn't successful in killing the project overall. They were successful in killing the size of the project; the rail line is not as big as it could have been, thanks to them. We could have had more jobs going up there now, but for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, the project is going forward, and the rail line is currently being built. Just the other day Adani did hit first coal at their Carmichael mine; although the coal seam they hit is not one they will mine. In a few months they will hit the coal seams they actually will mine, and later this year they will export the first coal from the first coal basin in 50 years from this country to another one, to India, and it will be a fantastic day for our nation. And it will be no thanks to any of those people here in this chamber in the Labor and the Greens parties; they actively tried to stop it. Thankfully, the Australian people rejected that at the last election, and we are getting those jobs. We have that mine and we are going to have future opportunity for northern Australia and North Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I do need to say, though, thanks to one person—that is, former Greens Senator Bob Brown. He was of enormous assistance getting the Adani mine going. I was trying for years, banging my head up against the wall, pushing, fighting, begging for the project to proceed. Bob Brown turns up and, within weeks, the whole thing is going forward. He was a magician, an absolute magician. There is one particular amendment I would suggest the Greens move that I might consider supporting. If they want to put Bob Brown on the NAIF broad, I might support that, almost as an honorary position for Bob Brown to come on to the NAIF board for his work in helping create jobs in northern Australia, and we would love to see him more in the north. I would love to have him back. Unfortunately—I have invited him many times—he is not coming, apparently. He has blamed COVID; now it is gone. But maybe if he was on the NAIF board he would actually come and visit us a bit more. He would come up to the Beetaloo Basin and help Senator McCarthy get shale gas going in the Northern Territory. He would come up to the west Kimberley in Senator Sterle's area and help us get cotton farming going around Kununurra; he would hate that too. He would do magic. He would do wonders up there. We could get that moving. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is so much opportunity across northern Australia and there are a lot of people from down south, like Senator Rice and others, who constantly want to downplay those opportunities, who often bring, can I say, a European mindset to our nation, where they think the north is hot and humid and infested with pests, and we should keep our population development down in the more sanguine Mediterranean climate of our south-east. But I think our nation's mission is actually to grow and develop across this great continent. It is great what we have done in cities like Melbourne and Sydney; they are fantastic testaments to what we have achieved as a nation. But we can actually build similarly successful and popular cities in other parts of our country as well, where there is plenty of water, where there are high-quality minerals, where there are high-quality soils to grow food in. If we invest in those areas, we won't maintain our position as a country where we are concentrated in just one small corner but we will spread, grow, develop and create the opportunity for thousands and millions more Australians, as we have done in the south.</span>

It doesn't help when we think about the $5 billion. Just imagine what we could be doing with $5 billion to improve the lives of the most impoverished Australians and those Australians who live in northern Australia. How about opening up the opportunities to those northern Australians who would dearly love to be able to access that $5 billion to build better homes and to have employment strategies that are long term, consistent and enable people to provide for their families, without the kind of sarcasm that comes from members opposite, who so want to dwell on their mates, punishing and rubbishing the people of the north who do their best, in circumstances where, economically, they are not on the same level as those opposite?</span>

The NAIF needs a bold correction, because $5 billion is not something to sneer at, not something to wave in front of the most impoverished people in this country and say, 'Hey, look at what we've got, and you want this.' That is not what this discussion here in the Senate is about. There needs to be far greater responsibility and acknowledgement of the mistakes—and there have been plenty of mistakes on the five- or six-year journey of this northern Australia infrastructure fund, or, as my colleague Senator Murray Watt has termed it, the 'no actual infrastructure fund'.</span>

Sure, I commend businesses like the Humpty Doo Barramundi fish farm. I had the opportunity to go out there and have a look. I think they are doing a terrific job, a wonderful job. They were doing that anyway, but they've certainly been assisted, as they rightly should be. And there are people who work at Voyages in Central Australia, First Nations people wanting opportunities in the hospitality industry, businesses in Central Australia, who desperately need tourism to do well for that part of the country. They shouldn't be laughed at and mocked for wanting to persevere in having access to $5 billion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the budget came down on Tuesday night, the people of the Northern Territory were told that budget 2021 would include an additional $150 million for the Northern Territory national network highway upgrades, for strengthening and widening, and $48 million for road safety projects. But none of this funding will hit the road in the coming financial year, and the Northern Territory will only see crumbs of the promised new roads infrastructure. But always there are strings attached to that kind of funding, aren't there, Madam Acting Deputy President, and, let me tell you, I will certainly be investigating those strings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninety-nine per cent of new Northern Territory funding is beyond the forward estimates. Let me repeat that: 99 per cent of the Northern Territory funding—new moneys—is beyond the forward estimates, perhaps as much as three elections away. So, hello, what do we have here? An announcement and no delivery. An announcement specifically for a purpose: to either prepare for an election or bring about a great wedge amongst First Nations people who want to look after country. Our roads are on the never-never when it comes to this government. This will hold up vital development, jobs creation and a hope of new industries and economic development in remote regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What it also does is show what's missing here. What's missing is the genuine engagement with First Nations people across northern Australia. I know the NAIF and those board members on it will highlight the two projects that have been involving First Nations people. We talk about an Aboriginal mining company in Western Australia. I would like to know more about that relationship, but I want to see those First Nations groups who look after country and sea country—our rangers, our seafarers—have ability to engage in the NAIF and to access this $5 billion. Where is the support and encouragement for them? Why is it that there has to be a siloed view that what you take from country is the only thing that is good enough for NAIF? How about giving back? How about giving back not just with country but in terms of the cultural connection that First Nations people have with the different kinship groups right across northern Australia in the desire to be able to create a home and family life with access to funds that ordinary Australians, most Australians, have?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what I want to see with the bold correction that this NAIF requires—the bold correction of enabling First Nations people to be consulted and genuinely engaged, not come to at the last minute and asked to sign off on things simply because it suits whoever it is that might be pushing forward a particular development in northern Australia. We've seen far too many examples of that, and it's got to stop. Australia, it has to stop. First Nations people are made to feel that they come to the table when it suits those who are making the deals, and it has to stop. There has to be thorough engagement. In the Northern Territory, there are only one or two projects that have come through NAIF, and that is not good enough for the people of the Northern Territory. Five or six years of waiting. There cannot be another five or six years of waiting to come. Things have to change. Stop wasting the opportunity of the north.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's amendments here to the NAIF, when implemented, are supposed to be a step in the right direction, but people in the north have every right to be sceptical of promises made by this government. Last week it was revealed that Keith Pitt used his ministerial veto power to block funding to a NAIF approved renewable energy project in North Queensland. That project would have created 250 jobs and delivered cheaper, more reliable power for Cairns. It's just another example of this government neglecting the north.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Northern Territory, we have work going on into building one of the world's largest solar farms. The Sun Cable $22 billion project in the Barkly region includes a 10-gigawatt solar farm. It's a massive project and, if it proceeds to financial closure, it may be looking to the NAIF for financial support. But even that project still needs thorough investigation in terms of the relationships with First Nations people. And that's not to put that project down. It's actually about reminding all businesses right across the country that we, as First Nations people, mean business. And we would like, and need to be, respected in that process. We can't let the renewable energy dinosaurs on the other side veto another key project, which could drive so much development opportunity in northern Australia. There are also many smaller groups who want to use the natural resources of the wind and sun energy of the north. Let them do it. Encourage them. Provide an incentive within this program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will be moving a number of amendments to this legislation, one of which would remove Keith Pitt's veto power so he can't put a stop to any more job-creating projects in northern Australia. And also in a bid to encourage more investment in renewables, one of our amendments will allow the NAIF board to encourage projects that assist in achieving net zero emissions by 2050. We would also require for-profit private sector projects to meet a rate of return in line with that of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. I would like to add here that Labor's amendments require the inclusion of the Indian Ocean territories within the definition of northern Australia. A massive shout-out to our constituents on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island. We have a family in detention who desperately need to get out. I say thank you to the families on Christmas Island who are trying to work with us on many issues, particularly the issue of removing that family from detention. So, as far as Labor is concerned, hopefully Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands will be included in the definition of northern Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another of our amendments will require First Nations representation on the NAIF board. Currently the NAIF board is made up of Western Australian and Queensland representatives. I understand there was a Northern Territory representative on the board in the initial stages, Barry Coulter, who has now retired. But we do need to see First Nations individuals and organisations represented as part of NAIF going forward, and that is an amendment that we will certainly be putting forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I would just say that the NAIF does need a bold correction. It has an incredible number of faults. The $5 billion is not to be sneered at. I urge this Senate, I urge the parliament, to consider those Australians in the north who do not have access to the kind of wealth that is clearly out there for many others and to use wisely this opportunity to enable those Australians to have a go.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0U" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  I rise today to speak in relation to this piece of legislation, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Extension and Other Measures) Bill. I must say I find it pretty bad practice for the Senate to be debating this today without first sending it to a Senate inquiry. This bill and its ramifications on our climate, our environment and our communities should be being inquired into. It seems pretty clear that the government is desperate to rush this through as quickly as they can. 'Why?' you may say, Madam Acting Deputy President. It's pretty easy—because the minister in charge has made a promise to his mates in the fossil fuel industry that they can get their claws into some of this money, the $5 billion that's going to be extended to allow the fossil fuel industry to get another handout from the taxpayer, to prop up what is a polluting and incredibly damaging industry for our climate, our environment and our children's future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is exactly the wrong way to go: to spend taxpayers' money opening up new gas fields, building new gas pipelines and propping up the coal industry when, in fact, we know the science is very clear. The rest of the world is begging Australia to get on board and to transition our economy from one that is fuelled by dirty fossil fuels to one that embraces the clean, green technologies that are going to power the world into the future, if we're going to deal with dangerous climate change. We've been encouraged over and over and over again by countries that we often compare ourselves to—the US, Canada, Germany and the UK. We've been told by the IMF, the UN and various economic think tanks around the world that, as we grapple with the economic recovery from COVID-19, we should be investing in the transformation to a clean, green economy, yet this bill and the changes that this bill makes, coupled with the billions of dollars handed out to the fossil fuel industry under Tuesday night's budget, is the exact opposite to investing in a clean recovery. In the United States, President Biden is spending $2 trillion in an infrastructure fund designed to invest in clean, green transformation of the economy. That is a good use of stimulus funding and an infrastructure fund—the exact opposite of what we are confronted with here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Billions of dollars are going towards gas and coal—dirty fossil fuels that are going to continue to pollute our environment and our planet. Germany is spending $47 billion on a green recovery. Canada is spending $36 billion on a green recovery. If we were debating today billions of dollars going towards an infrastructure fund that was going to transform our economy to where we need to go, we would be backing it, but that is not what we're confronted with today. We're confronted with outdated, old thinking that puts public money into the hands of the dirty fossil fuel industry. It's not reading between the lines of this bill that proves that that is what is going on; the minister responsible has boasted about it. The minister responsible has no qualms about saying he wants to open up more opportunities for the Beetaloo infrastructure financing—public money being spent on dirty fossil fuels. I always think the irony here from the conservative side of the parliament is that they're all okay for social spending when it comes to money for the fossil fuel industry and subsidies to the coal and gas industry, but oh, no, we couldn't possibly give some money to the unemployed or to environmental restoration. The hypocrisy in this place is rank, and this bill says it all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only has Minister Pitt bragged and boasted that this extension of the NAIF scheme and this piece of legislation will deliver for his mates in the coal and gas industry but he's then used his veto powers to stop projects that are actually good for climate action and good for transforming the economy. He vetoed a wind farm that had battery back-up. This is exactly the type of project that we should be seeing infrastructure spending going towards. This is an industry that should be supported by this government. This minister has stood for stopping jobs. That project in Kaban, near Cairns, in Queensland, was going to create 250 jobs. Minister Pitt is a job-killer and a planet-killer and is handing out cash from taxpayers to his mates in the fossil fuel industry. That's what this bill is about. It's going to cost jobs, it's going to cost our environment and it ultimately costs the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the rest of the world is transitioning, in our trade negotiations with other countries we're starting to be frowned upon by not looking towards a transition out of fossil fuels. We're getting marked down for that. In our negotiations with the EU they're starting to say, 'Hang on a minute, we're not going to keep negotiating with a country like Australia if all you are doing is continuing to prop up polluting industries.' It's starting to cost us around the world not just in reputation but in terms of our negotiations and ultimately our future economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this piece of legislation is a false economy. This is denial in the extreme: $5 billion for the rules to be rewritten so that it can just be handed over by the minister, by the fund. By the way, this bill stops the NAIF board from having any sense of independence by putting the department secretary on it. This is the Liberal National Party's slush fund for the coal and gas industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have been concerned about this fund from day dot. We raised serious concerns at the beginning, and now we're seeing the rules changed even more to make it easier for the slush fund. It beggars belief, to be honest, that the Labor Party is not standing stronger against this, because at the end of the day this is a slush fund for the LNP in Queensland, and that's all it is: $5 billion of public money so that they can keep their mates in the coal and gas industry happy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, we have everyday Australians who are struggling with zero wage growth, hundreds of thousands of Australians who are struggling to find permanent work and hundreds of thousands of Australians who are underemployed. Australians can't get to the dentist to get their teeth fixed, because the government won't fund proper dental care. But the government are more than happy to put $5 billion of public money on the table for their mates in the dirty fossil fuel industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be moving an amendment to this piece of legislation. I know Senator Waters is moving a series of amendments which would stop this money going towards those projects that would make our climate worse. We should stop putting public money behind fossil fuels, which are making our climate worse. You can't take seriously anyone from this government on climate action while, under the table, they're propping up the industry that's making things worse. Senator Waters' amendment will make it clear that this $5 billion should be going towards projects that are good for the planet, that help transition our economy to put us in line with the countries that we always like to compare ourselves with around the world—Canada, the US, the UK and Europe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to stop making climate change worse. We have a lot of work to do to try to stop it from becoming dangerous and to keep temperature rises below 1.5 degrees, but it's near impossible to do that while, at the same time, we're continuing to let the fossil fuel industry pollute and pollute and pollute. One step forward, two steps back; it's a false strategy and it is deeply buried in denialism and vested interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I hope there is support for Senator Waters' amendments. I'll be moving an amendment that says at the very least we shouldn't be spending $5 billion of taxpayers' money on projects that trash the environment, that run through conservation protected areas. I know this government's obsessed with spending public money on fossil fuels, but could we at least think about the rest of the environment—our national parks, our protected conservation areas, the farmland and agricultural areas that have been earmarked by their owners as being looked after for conservation? There are lots of parts of Australia that will be impacted by a number of these projects that the government wants to push on through with taxpayers' money, and some of them at this point are listed to run right through or dig up some of Australia's most unique environments and areas of nature, putting at risk bushland and unique desert areas and threatening our native species.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you can't come at stopping this money going to polluting fossil fuel industries then at least do something about protecting the environment in which these projects are being mooted to be housed. Let's think about the fact that we need to protect our precious Australian outback. Our native animals that live in some of these places are found nowhere else on earth. Once you've devastated their homes and they've become endangered and extinct, they'll never, ever come back. We need to be thinking more long term about the impacts of these types of projects on the climate, on our nature, on our wildlife, on our precious places, on our bushland, on our grasslands, on our forests and on our unique desert. Handing out money to projects that degrade Australia's environment should be a no-go zone. We've already lost so much of what makes our environment so precious and unique. We've got to stop ruining the little that is left. It's important for the long-term survival of our wildlife and our native species, but it's important for us as a community too.</span>

                    </a>  Exactly. No conflicts of interest there at all! Completely independent advice! It will also remove the requirement to gain the support of the host state or territory for future projects supported by the NAIF. In other words, it removes the state veto power. In other words, the Commonwealth can come in and fund a development in my home state of Western Australia—for example, in the magnificent Kimberley—which the state opposes, which perhaps the First Nations peoples oppose. For example, a dam on the Fitzroy is something that I've opposed for as long as I can remember and campaigned against, but this bill might let the Commonwealth do that, because they think it's a very good idea, which, of course, it isn't.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to offer a few observations, if I might, in support of the motion that the Greens are putting. Firstly, I want colleagues to know that what we're all suffering under here is yet another dirty deal on refugees struck between the ALP and the Liberal-National government. What this bill seeks to do is to undermine a decision made last year by Justice Bromberg, who ruled that the immigration detention of a particular person, known in that court case as AJL20, by the Commonwealth was unlawful and ordered the government to release him from detention immediately. The ruling also entitled AJL20 to claim damages. In that decision, Justice Bromberg further ruled that government cannot hold people in immigration detention indefinitely for no reason—that is, the government must actively pursue an outcome for the detainees they keep locked up, whether that be deportation or release into the community or to a third country. What the government is trying to do is come in here and, with the support of the Labor Party, subvert Justice Bromberg's decision and make it easier for the government to detain people indefinitely in immigration detention. I'll point out that the Labor Party took to the last election a policy of ending indefinite immigration detention onshore in Australia and providing a 30-day limit for immigration detention. Now here is the Labor Party ganging up with the government, doing a secret, dirty deal with the government, to once again do over refugees and make it easier for the government to detain people indefinitely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not all that this bill does. The other thing that this bill does that is extremely troubling is that it includes a new power that would allow the government to reconsider a person's refugee status. So, even if someone has previously been found to be a refugee in Australia, the department or minister could reopen that decision at any time under section 197D(2) of the government's amended act. What this means, of course, is that someone could have been found to be a refugee a decade ago or a couple of decades ago in Australia, they could have built a life here—built a home here, built a career here, established a family here, paid taxes here and lived here, effectively, as an Australian—and then the government could turn around and say: 'Well, the conditions in your home country have changed. It's now safe for you to go back. Ta-ta, off you go. Go back to where you came from.' This is the government's philosophy that now, apparently, has been signed up to by the Labor Party, believing that our protection obligations are only temporary. They are not only temporary. They should be permanent. If somebody is found to be a refugee and has fled because they have a genuine and well-founded fear of persecution, they should get permanent protection and they should be put on a pathway immediately that would allow them ultimately to obtain Australian citizenship and reside here. But that's not what this bill does; it overturns that principle and will allow the government to reopen those refugee status determinations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shame on the Liberal Party for bringing this bill on. It is a complex bill that should be referred to a Senate inquiry, which is what our motion is proposing. This bill has the potential to have massive, potentially life-or-death impacts on people's lives. Totally unsurprisingly, once again here are the collaborators in refugee torture, the Australian Labor Party, who invented the last iteration of offshore detention, who have blood on their hands for exiling people to Manus Island and Nauru. They're once again coming into this place and teaming up with the Liberal and National parties in order to do over refugees in this country. Shame on you all for even thinking about it, and another layer of shame on you all for jamming this bill through the parliament with no Senate inquiry and no opportunity for stakeholders to share their views with the Senate, jamming it through effectively without meaningful debate today. This bill was only introduced into the parliament this week, and here it is being jammed through by a motion that will have support from both the Liberal and National parties and the ALP. Seriously, just when you think life for refugees couldn't get any worse in Australia, here we are.</span>

It should not be left up to school programs, which are so often based on ideology of the day, to be educating our children in sex education. While we support schools complementing the work of parents in this area, primary aged children cannot, by default, be taught about consent when they are not in a position to either give or deny consent. They are children. Our parents have the first responsibility to ensure their children are equipped to engage in respectful relationships. We will be opposing this.</span>

We are doing our bit by meeting and beating our emissions reduction commitments and by investing $20 billion in low-emissions technology, to drive at least $80 billion of total public and private investment by 2030. Our gas-fired recovery is focused on ensuring Australian gas works for all Australians. It is supporting a resurgence in our manufacturing sector, which more than 900,000 Australians rely on for their livelihoods. The senator would be aware that the International Energy Agency director, Fatih Birol, has said that carbon capture technologies are necessary on a global scale if we are to meet the Paris Agreement.</span>

                  </a>  So far we've had a global warming emergency, then a climate change emergency, then a climate catastrophe emergency. Now we've got a climate collapse emergency. One thing we've never had is any empirical scientific evidence showing that carbon dioxide from human activity needs to be cut. I first challenged Senator Waters to debate me and to provide the scientific evidence 10½ years ago. She immediately declined. She declined again in 2016 and again 602 days ago in the Senate. There has been nothing since, because there is no such evidence justifying the collapse of our electricity sector. What is threatened with extinction here is not our planet; it is our civilisation and it is science.</span>

                  </a>  The Morrison government has committed $1.1 billion to women's safety as the down payment to the next national plan. There's been no cut to homelessness funding nor a reduction in crisis accommodation by the South Australian government. To suggest otherwise is blatant fearmongering. Under the reforms, at Catherine House crisis bed numbers will remain the same and at-risk women will continue to get the support they need when they need it. In 2020-21, the Morrison government will spend $1.6 billion specifically in payments to states and territories under the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  It is no surprise that no Labor senators stood to speak on the second reading here, because what we are faced with is yet another bill to make life far more difficult and potentially put refugees' lives at risk being jammed through this parliament because of collusion by the LNP and the ALP, who, as always, are in lock step on the shameful way that we treat refugees in this country. The Migration Amendment (Clarifying International Obligations for Removal) Bill 2021 now is going to be ushered through with an exemption from the cut-off order. It will be denied a Senate inquiry, and we are now facing debate being guillotined in 10 short minutes time, thanks to a dirty deal between the ALP and the LNP, who like nothing more than colluding with each other to destroy the lives of people who come to this country seeking our help and protection from persecution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill comes about because the government introduced section 197C of the Migration Act in 2014, when the now Prime Minister was Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. I put on the record that that provision, section 197C, was supported not only by the LNP but by the ALP and was of course not supported by the Australian Greens. That section requires the government to disregard its nonrefoulement obligations when deporting people from Australia under section 198 of the Migration Act. The introduction of that provision, 197C, therefore created a tension between the government's stated policy of compliance with nonrefoulement obligations and its now self-imposed obligation to remove people from Australia irrespective of nonrefoulement obligations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That section, 197C, was challenged in the Commonwealth of Australia v AJL20, which was a landmark case based on a habeas corpus argument. AJL20, the person that was the subject of that case, languished in indefinite immigration detention because he couldn't be returned to war-torn Syria when it wasn't safe to do so, and yet the government refused to grant him a protection visa. That person languished in indefinite immigration detention, like so many others. Let's be clear about this: Australia's record on immigration detention is the shame of the world. There are no countries similar to Australia that have average lengths of immigration detention anywhere near what Australia has. It is not unheard of for people to spend more than a decade in immigration detention in this country, and the average time that people spend in immigration detention in Australia is significantly longer than in any similar country in the world; for example, the United Kingdom or Canada. Last year Justice Bromberg ruled that AJL20's detention had been unlawful and ordered the government to release him from immigration detention immediately. He further ruled that the government cannot hold people indefinitely in detention for no reason. They must be actively pursuing an outcome for the detainees they keep locked up, whether that be deportation or release into the community or a third country. This was a landmark precedent, and now the government is coming in, with the cooperation of the Labor Party, and trying to subvert Justice Bromberg's decision, or the effect of Justice Bromberg's decision. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will have serious impacts on the visa cancellation process, particularly for refugees who may face cancellation for minor incidents, because under these powers the decision-maker would no longer be able to consider the risk of indefinite detention or harm from refoulement while making the decision to cancel their visa. Instead, these considerations could only be dealt with through a separate, later protection visa application made while the person is in detention. Not only are the government and the Labor Party colluding to try to achieve those outcomes; the government has also inserted into this bill the inclusion of a new power to reconsider a person's refugee status, so that even if someone has previously been found to be a refugee by the Australian government—that is, it is found that we owe them protection—the department or minister could reopen that decision at any time under proposed section 197D(2) of the government's amendment on sheet RV151. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a complicated, highly complex amendment to a complicated, highly complex section of the Migration Act. What chance has this parliament had to scrutinise it? Absolutely none: rammed through the House this week, jammed through the Senate as we speak, under an exemption from the cut-off order. There has been no Senate inquiry whatsoever, so we've not been able to hear from stakeholders on this issue. This is a disgrace. This bill could result in people dying. Those who vote for this bill will have blood on their hands. But do you know what? They'll be comfortable with that because they've already got blood on their hands; for example, Reza Berati's blood and the blood of the other at least 13 people who died in our horrendous, racist offshore detention regime. Now these major parties want to put more blood, potentially, on their hands by ramming through a bill that would allow for someone's refugee status to be overturned and for them either to languish in indefinite detention as a result or to end up being sent back to danger and persecution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We would have liked to interrogate this bill in the committee stage. We have some questions about whether or not the government has actually been refouling people under the 197C provisions. There are only two possible scenarios here. One is the government has been returning people back to face danger, which would be an extreme international embarrassment and contrary to our international obligations, or it's been in breach of its own stupid law, and we would like to know which it is. We're not going to get a chance to ask those questions today because the government, along with the Labor Party, is guillotining this bill through, and in five minutes time there'll be no further opportunity for debate, no further opportunity for questions in this place, and the remaining questions on this legislation will be put without debate. This is what the Labor Party has allowed the government to get away with in this place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will lead to more refugees languishing in indefinite immigration detention in Australia without a habeas corpus claim. What is this country coming to! You've got to be careful how you allow governments to treat refugees, because, if you let them get away with treating refugees like they are subhuman, which is what the Liberal-National coalition and the ALP do, sooner or later they'll be coming for the rest of us. If you want any evidence on that have a look right now at what we've dealt with over the last two weeks for Australian citizens stranded in India. We let the coalition and the ALP, despite the best efforts of the Australian Greens, get away with deliberately harming people by detaining them indefinitely in offshore detention. Now, because the government's become emboldened and wants to have an election based in part at least on border control along with, of course, the beating drums of war that are so beloved by the coalition, we have a situation where the government is threatening to put Australian citizens attempting to come home from India, which has been ravaged by coronavirus, in jail if they try. That is what happens when you allow governments to get away with treating people as subhuman: sooner or later you get scope creep, you get bracket creep, and other people are treated in that same way. That is the situation facing Australian citizens who wish to come back to this country from India.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wanted to ask questions about the dirty deal that Labor did. These two pieces of legislation that are being debated together, despite the Greens' attempts to separate them, appear to be collectively the result of a deal between the coalition and the ALP. The Labor Party selling their soul so cheaply for a minor increase in transparency with regard to introducing a requirement to table notice of certain character decisions that are made under section 501 of the Migration Act just goes to show how little the modern Labor Party in Australia value human rights and how cheaply they are prepared to sell themselves to this government: very, very cheap. You couldn't even get a decent deal out of the government for your complicity in riding roughshod over human rights, riding roughshod over Australia's international obligations. And those are not just contained in the refugee convention and the protocol to that convention, I might add; there are numerous other international statutes and agreements that Australia has signed up to that this legislation flies in the face of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Labor, the price of selling their soul yet again will not only sit very heavily on all those who support them as the progressive party; it will sit particularly heavily on all those who will be affected by this brutal and callous piece of legislation. Defending human rights should be core business for all of us in this place, and yet time after time it is only the Australian Greens who stand up for human rights, who stand up for the rule of law in this place and who stand up for fairness and justice in this country. So we would have liked to have moved an amendment to this bill. I understand I'll have to try and do that by leave now. I want to say to colleagues: just when you think this parliament could not sink any lower in the way that it treats refugees and people whose only crime was to reach out a hand to our country and seek our assistance and protection, the bottom comes out of the debate and down the elevator we go. This is yet another chapter in a dark and bloody story.</span>

As I said this morning on the ABC, our objective is to offer every Australian the opportunity to have a vaccine before the end of this year. The assumptions in the budget papers are very different to government policy in that the objective is to offer all Australians access to a vaccine by the end of this year. We have, as I said yesterday during question time, continued to grow and develop the vaccine rollout based on the availability of vaccines. As more vaccine supply has become available, we have expanded the vaccine rollout. We have commenced with stage 1A as we scheduled and then we commenced the process of vaccinating those in 1B as we scheduled. We've brought on GP practices and vaccination clinics around the country to expand the vaccination rollout this week. We're expanding the availability of vaccines.</span>

It was narrowly constructed. I'm listening carefully. If he's only talking about the government's vaccination policy, I believe that is covered and directly relevant to the question, even if it is to be debated after question time.

It would be nice if Labor listened to the answers that government members gave, because I have in my answer already directly addressed the question that was asked by Senator Kitching and I am providing additional information to the parliament with respect to the vaccination rollout. As of close of business on 12 May, 2,894,770 Australians have received a vaccination, with 82,284 in the last 24 hours. The vaccine rollout continues to gather pace as we have available more vaccines, and it has been controlled by vaccine availability, all the way through. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

All Australians would understand that, as the vaccination rollout has progressed, there has been the issue of supply, and, as more supply has become available, we have made more available to Australians. Once we understood the circumstances with respect to AstraZeneca and had the AstraZeneca vaccine available to us—which required a 12-week period between the first and the second dose—that had an impact on the vaccination rollout, and of course the time at which people would have their first and second dose. As we have had additional access to vaccines, we have continued to roll out the vaccine.

Australia entered the COVID-19 pandemic from a position of economic strength. Those opposite, prior to COVID, liked to talk the economy down but it was performing strongly, as we know. For the first time in 11 years, the budget was in balance. We actually had workforce participation in Australia, prior to COVID, at a record high. In excess of 13 million Australians were in work. Of course, as Senator Ruston well knows, we also had welfare dependency at its lowest in a generation. That is something that we should all be very, very proud of. The strong fiscal position that the government was in at the time enabled us to respond decisively in putting in place a $290 billion economic support package.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms now, though, of the government's economic and fiscal strategy, the budget very much does set out the economic recovery strategy that we have, in particular by supporting sustainable, private sector led growth and job creation. We are looking to drive down the unemployment rate lower than precrisis levels. As we know, in terms of workforce participation at this point in time, we still have now, even though we've been through COVID, more Australians in employment than ever before. In fact, the unemployment rate has fallen rapidly and is set to recover five times faster than the last recession, in the 1990s. This is a government that is committed to putting in place the economic framework so that businesses can employ more Australians.</span>

Certainly the budget that came down on Tuesday night is well and truly supporting regional Australia's economic recovery, helping to create jobs and, more importantly, to grow regional industries. Around 43,000 Australians last year moved from the city to regional Australia because they appreciate the benefits that are afforded to them in regional Australia. The budget that we handed down on Tuesday night is investing, as we know, in infrastructure and in regional infrastructure right across the Northern Territory. This is all about, as Senator McMahon knows, making roads safer and reducing travel times but at the same time supporting more than 900 direct and indirect jobs for Territorians. Again, this is a government that understands putting in place the right policy framework to create more jobs for Australians.</span>

Almost a million people have now returned to work. Those jobs have come back into the economy since the trough of COVID-19, and Australians moving back into the workforce is something that we should be celebrating. The 2020-21 budget is the next stage of the Morrison government's economic plan to secure Australia's recovery. The budget is all about creating jobs—because that's what this government does; we create jobs—guaranteeing the essential services that Australians rely on, and ensuring that we build a more resilient and secure Australia. Certainly we are putting in place the policy framework to do just that. Personal income tax cuts are creating more economic activity, and, when you create more economic activity, what do you do? You actually enable job creation. There are business tax incentives to get businesses to invest in their businesses and to create more jobs. There are new apprenticeships and new training places. Again, this is a government that understands that you put in place the right policy framework so that businesses can prosper, grow and create more jobs for Australians.</span>

That's the objective of the government. As we have more vaccine available, we will increase the availability to more people in Australia to get the vaccine. We started with phase 1a in February and then phase 1b in March, and we've continued to expand the rollout as we've had more vaccine available. The availability of vaccine has always been the constraint in the context of the rollout and, of course, the rollout has also been guided by the medical advice. The medical advice with respect to the AstraZeneca vaccine, where there's a requirement for a 12-week gap between the two doses, has had an impact on the process and the timing of the vaccine rollout. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor were honest and hadn't spent all of their time trying to undermine the confidence in the vaccine rollout, they would acknowledge that. They would acknowledge that the availability of vaccine, the medical requirements and the advice of the health professionals, all of which have guided the vaccine rollout, have had an impact on the vaccine rollout all of the way through. As we've had more vaccine available, we've made it available to Australians, and we have taken the advice of the medical and health experts in the application of the vaccine all of the way through. That has required some resets in the context of the vaccination rollout, and we've been quite open and honest with the Australian people about that as those circumstances have arisen. But the Labor Party have not been honest. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The timing of their full vaccination will be dependent on when they take that up. Senator Birmingham said recently that some Australians may still be getting vaccinated next year because that may be their choice. If they have the first dose of a vaccine that's made available to them late in December, they won't get the second dose of AstraZeneca, if that's the choice of the vaccine they take up, until 12 weeks later. Those are the simple facts. Our intention, as I've said a number of times today, is to provide every Australian who wants access to a vaccine to have available to them that vaccine by the end of this year. I could not have been clearer. If the Labor Party don't want to listen to the answer, I can't help that. I have been very consistent with all of my answers today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We have continued to roll out the vaccine and make it available to Australians in the context of supply, and we will continue to do that. We will continue to roll out safely the vaccine to Australians, making available to them the opportunity to have a dose of the vaccine by the end of this year. We will continue to do that. The availability of the vaccination process will be contingent on supply and, as supply grows, we will make the vaccine available to more Australians. </span>

Minister, in recent weeks violence has engulfed Israel and Palestine following the threatened evictions of Palestinian families from East Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood and restrictions on and violence against worshippers at al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan. In the last few days the violence has escalated and resulted in the deaths of 67 Palestinians and seven Israelis so far. Minister, do you agree that this latest devastating outbreak of violence stems from the unlawful and unjust occupation of Palestine by the Israeli government? Isn't ending the occupation the best way to end the violence? </span>

We unequivocally call on all leaders to take immediate steps to halt violence, to maintain restraint and to restore calm. We also call on parties to refrain from unilateral actions that destabilise peace. The focus of all parties should be to return to genuine discussions as soon as possible. Australia has for many years supported a two-state solution, and this has not changed. We continue to welcome any initiative that can assist the resumption of direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. We encourage the representatives of Israel and Palestinian representatives to enter into good faith negotiations and discussions.</span>

Australia regularly raise our position about settlement activity with Israeli authorities. Indeed, the Prime Minister and Minister Payne have both done so. The Prime Minister has already said that settlements can at times undermine peace and contribute to the stalemate, and that indeed is why the government continues to urge parties to engage appropriately in discussions.</span>

The rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel are never justified and represent indiscriminate acts that fuel the cycle of violence and bloodshed. They must cease. We do note that Israel, like any state, always has a right to self-defence under the UN charter. That does not change the government's position in relation to the long-term importance of discussion between the parties and ensuring that the parties avoid all measures and matters that can escalate the chance of conflict and violence.</span>

What I can confirm is what the government has done in this budget. There is a $110 billion pipeline of infrastructure projects around the nation over the next 10 years, including in Queensland—for example, $400 million in funding for the Bruce Highway addition and many, many other projects. There's $400 million for the inland freight route from Mungindi to Charters Towers, for the upgrades there; $240 million for the Cairns western arterial road duplication; $160 million for Mooloolah River interchange upgrade, for packages 1 and 2; and an additional—</span>

Far from Queensland being left behind, Queensland, across many government programs and infrastructure projects, is receiving billions of dollars from the federal government, which is creating thousands and thousands of jobs right across Queensland.</span>

The senator talks about water projects. In this budget the Australian government has committed to an additional $7.5 million towards the Rookwood Weir, half a million dollars towards the second stage of the Warwick recycled water and treatment upgrade, and there are many more. It is one thing for the federal government to allocate the money, but the state government has to deliver it, so I suggest that the question should be better directed towards the Queensland premier.</span>

                  </a>  I know, I know. My question is to Senator Birmingham, representing the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The State Grid Corporation of China is a 60 per cent shareholder in a foreign owned company trading as Jemena. Jemena owns electricity-generation assets and is the second-largest owner of Australia's gas pipelines, including gas pipelines in Queensland. Jemena pays no tax in Australia, because it says it has borrowed at 10.5 per cent from its parent company. Jemena says it is subject to an ATO audit for transfer pricing because of this arrangement. Despite a serious trade war with China, Jemena is seeking funding from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility for a proposed pipeline from Mount Isa through the Galilee Basin to Roma. My question is: how much money is the federal government planning to loan to the Chinese government so China can own critical infrastructure assets in Australia?</span>

It's a serious question in relation to the protection of critical infrastructure and security assets across Australia, and indeed our government has moved at successive points over the years to make sure that we tighten areas of foreign investment laws—that we ensure, for example, that assets sales by state or territory governments that previously were not captured by foreign investment approval processes are now captured under those processes. Through our security-of-critical-infrastructure reforms we have also put in place new measures and are strengthening those measures even further in relation to how it is that crucial, critical infrastructure assets such as our energy systems and communication systems are appropriately protected from risks in relation to cyberattacks or other types of attacks that could undermine their operations and, through that, the nation's security.</span>

I would also note that the reforms to the foreign investment and acquisition laws that we have outlined and introduced include measures that ensure, where a company has been granted approval to operate in one sphere and then uses that to expand into areas that may be sensitive and would be contrary to Australia's national interest, that there are now call-in powers that the Treasurer can exercise, and the Treasurer can withdraw certain rights and approvals to companies if they do so.</span>

Certainly, our government continues to pursue measures to ensure energy security across Australia, to ensure that we have a reliability of supply. That requires, at times, the driving of investment decisions forward in relation to generation of new energy in certain sectors. However, Senator Hanson, in relation to the particular grants or supports, I would emphasise to you that we always make sure that companies are operating within Australia's laws. And, indeed, our government has taken various steps over the years to make sure that global tax avoidance measures have been taken in Australia, that we tighten those laws—and we are, in fact, yielding some billions of dollars in additional tax revenue as a result of measures that have been taken to tighten areas of global tax avoidance.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for International Development and the Pacific</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:31</span>):  I thank Senator Van for the question. Yes, I can. The Liberal-National government is securing Australia's recovery with investment of more than $1.8 billion in the 2021-22 budget to boost jobs and support affordable and reliable energy. Through our 'technology, not taxes' approach, this year's budget will continue to provide reliable, secure and affordable energy to all Australians and to increase investment in technology solutions to reduce emissions in a way that supports jobs and economic growth. Australia's competitive advantage has always been based on cheap energy, and gas will be central to our ongoing economic recovery. We're advancing our gas-fired recovery and ensuring that Australian gas is working for all Australians, with $58.6 million to support new initiatives. We're taking action in three key areas to boost the east coast gas market across the entire supply chain. We are unlocking supply, delivering an efficient pipeline and transportation market, and empowering gas customers. We've delivered on the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Gas Infrastructure Plan interim report</span>, which shows that both local production and new infrastructure is needed to alleviate the forecast shortfall in southern states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government can't sit back and allow the gas shortfall to eventuate. It would have a devastating impact on the economy. That's why we're backing the critical projects through $38.7 million of targeted support. Without the action we're taking to address supply, industry and households will be faced with higher prices from price-gouging energy companies and more blackouts, just as South Australia experienced in 2016. On this side, we understand that gas is a critical enabler of Australia's economy. It supports our manufacturing sector, which employs over 900,000 Australians, many in the regions. Gas will be critical to providing the dispatchable and affordable power generation we need to keep prices down while also deploying new technology into the system. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I know that Senator Whish-Wilson will be very pleased with that. Through the 2021-22 budget, we are investing an additional $275 million to accelerate the development of an Australian hydrogen industry. This new funding will increase the government's total support for a hydrogen industry to over $845 million. This package will support an additional four regional hydrogen hubs, in addition to the $70.2 million committed in last year's budget for the first hydrogen hub. We look far and wide around the nation for potential sites, from the Eyre Peninsula in the south to Darwin in the north. Together with our investments in carbon capture and storage, this will create around 2,500 jobs, delivering on our technology-led plan to secure the economic recovery and continue the jobs growth.</span>

That's why our budget funds new gas generators and invests in technologies we need to lower prices for families and businesses. What is Labor offering? Just what their Greens counterparts would like. They only have a recipe for more taxes, more power blackouts and higher prices. They have Chris Bowen in charge of energy policy, who's never seen a tax he didn't like. They have Murray Watt, who continues to support the resources sector. They are completely divided when it comes to the role of gas in the system. They apparently have an energy plan for 2050 but not for 2030. They simply can't be trusted to deliver the reliable, affordable energy Australians deserve. We reject Labor's attempt to hoodwink Australians. Australians know it will be technology, not taxes, that will secure our recovery, and that is exactly— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I invite Senator Hanson-Young to take a look at the ocean strategy outlined in the budget to see the measures there, measures indeed consistent with a blue economy. I invite her to take a look at the waste reduction strategy there, measures consistent with our government's action to ban the export of recyclables and waste from Australia. I invite her to look, indeed, at the climate and emissions reductions measures that are there, outlined in detail and, most importantly, delivering results. According to the forecasts of emissions, we will avoid in the order of 250 million tonnes of emissions each year by 2040. This is building on the fact that we have continuously met and exceeded our nation's commitments. We expect to see around $20 billion of investment in low-emissions technology over the decade to 2030 as the government helps to secure around $80 billion in total investment from the private sector and governments. It's working, it is meeting and beating our targets and we're committed to policies that will continue to do so.</span>

It's unsurprising to anybody on this side of the chamber or to anybody who has heard the Greens over the years claim of course, endlessly, that things aren't happening when in fact they are. We've all heard the Greens say that we wouldn't meet any of our emissions reduction targets over the years yet each time we do meet them, we do exceed them. The Greens say this endlessly. Yes, we take very seriously the importance of wildlife protection, the preservation of endangered species, and the pursuit in relation to measures and policies to help support them is one we will continue.</span>

If a question asks about a matter in the budget paper in a portfolio area, the minister is constraining her comments to, in essence, infrastructure projects in the Northern Territory. If I'm being asked to insist that she uses words to address the point of order in the specific nature you make it, I believe I'm crossing the line into instructing a minister how to answer the question. The minister is not straying into broader commentary about alternative policies but is speaking about infrastructure in the Northern Territory. I believe that is directly relevant.

                  </a>  On the point of order, I am not clear whether the minister is continuing to speak about the past but what I would submit is that for a question about the forward estimates and beyond that an answer that refers to past investment is not directly relevant to the question. Temporally, it makes no sense to suggest that you can answer a question about future spending only by referencing past spending.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  I think, to be fair, the way I heard the minister answering the question was the minister was addressing and listing projects currently underway, not beyond the forward estimates. I think going into the territory of instructing a minister that in a portfolio area they can't talk about the budget to that degree of specificity is actually getting into the content. If the minister is talking about projects currently underway but they are within the forward estimates, there's an opportunity to debate whether the minister has answered the question to your satisfaction after question time, but I don't think can I say that's not directly relevant because the minister's constraining her comments to that specific issue of that policy area.</span>

                  </a>  The point I was making is that we have been supporting the Northern Territory in a wide range of infrastructure projects, for all of the budgets, I believe, that we've had since coming into government—and don't forget that we do this in partnership with the Northern Territory government, and in fact we support projects that they put forward and that are shovel ready. I've just had a look, and, over the last budget and this budget, I can count at least 30 separate projects which are in various stages of construction—some are in planning, some are approved—and they go out well beyond the forward estimates. The fact that funding goes beyond the forward estimates is a good thing, because that means there is a steady pipeline of projects in the Northern Territory to sustain jobs, probably for at least a decade, if not more. So that, I think, is a great thing done by this government.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator HUME</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and the Digital Economy and Minister for Women's Economic Security</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  I'd like to thank Senator Bragg for his question and his enduring interest in Australia's digital economy and progress. Digital technologies play such an important role in our daily lives, but perhaps no more so than in the last 18 months. They have helped businesses to stay afloat and people to interact and transact in new and different ways, and they've also enabled people to get access to life-saving information and services. The Morrison government knows that getting the policy settings right, now, will ensure that Australia's prosperity continues over the next decade and beyond.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I was incredibly proud to stand with the Prime Minister last week and announce the $1.2 billion Digital Economy Strategy. This strategy is a living plan, designed to ensure that we have the right infrastructure, skills, settings and services in place. It outlines our digital growth priorities that will make it clear what we need to do to achieve that ambition. They include things like lifting our digital capability and adoption across small and medium businesses to support new ways to work and grow, increase profitability and, of course, save time—for example, through a $15.3 million enhancement to the uptake of e-invoicing, to save time and money for businesses—and supporting globally-competitive export sectors operating at the digital frontier, including manufacturing, mining, agriculture and construction, and, of course, building the emerging technology capability and accelerating the growth of tech startups such as fintechs, regtechs and digital games, to drive an uplift in the rest of the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This broad package has been received extraordinarily well. FinTech Australia CEO Rebecca Schot-Guppy said the announcement was welcome news for the entire technology and startup ecosystem. The BCA said that the Digital Economy Strategy was a win-win, and the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association said that the games tax offset, a key part of that strategy, was one of the most significant to be implemented anywhere in the world.</span>

Empowering individuals and businesses to have better control and gain benefit from their own data that's collected by industry is an important part of the Morrison government's $1.2 billion Digital Economy Strategy. One hundred and eleven million dollars will help accelerate the economy-wide rollout of the consumer data right, which will provide enormous opportunities for regtech and fintech startups to drive competition, building new products and services to help consumers manage and understand their data and get better value from product and service providers such as telcos, banks and energy companies, to save time and save money. Importantly, the consumer data right is delivered in partnership with industry and has privacy settings embedded into its design to ensure it's a safe and secure system.</span>

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused immense disruption here in Australia and across our region. Our response is simple. We are supporting Australians and we are supporting our region. Through this budget, the government is investing in an open, inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific region. Labor is maintaining an outrageous lie—that we have cut development funding in the budget. Let me be perfectly clear: we've maintained Australia's baseline $4 billion ODA budget, which will continue over the forward estimates, rising in the out years. And, in response to the pandemic, the government is delivering $1 billion of additional investments over the years to 2023-24—over $800 million this year and next. We make no apology for the government front-loading these investments. Is Labor really arguing that we should hold off on supporting our neighbours at this critical time as they are dealing—</span>

                  </a>  Well, you got it wrong. We're not going to take your advice and hold back the additional assistance at a time of crisis. The government has demonstrated again and again that we will allocate new funding in response to the need in our region. COVID-19 has created a highly fluid international environment, and the government's temporary and targeted measures are exactly the right tool to respond to that environment. In the year ahead, we'll provide $262 million to support our region's vaccine procurement and $156 million to address the economic impacts of the pandemic. In 2021 we delivered approximately $1.7 billion in ODA to the Pacific, over 50 per cent higher than Labor delivered to the region when last in office, so we're not going to be lectured to by the Labor Party about our commitment to supporting our Pacific family and our Pacific neighbours.</span>

The human suffering caused by COVID is immense, but, equally, its impact on long-term economic stability and security is also concerning. The government has committed $305 million to support economic resilience and recovery from COVID-19. Already $200 million has been disbursed to our nearest neighbours. In the year ahead Australia will provide a further $100 million across the Pacific and Timor-Leste to maintain essential services and protect the most vulnerable. For countries like Fiji which are highly dependent on international tourism, the shutdown of international travel has been absolutely devastating. We can help Fiji to get the virus under control and support its quick return to economic growth. I'll be speaking to the Fiji health minister today about our cooperation, and we'll be delivering more Australian vaccines to Fiji this week. We will always support our Pacific family. A safe region means a safe Australia, and our support at this time is more important than ever.</span>

What those opposite don't understand is that Australia's partnership with Pacific nations extends far beyond the record ODA budget in the Pacific. Labor seems to believe that bilateral ODA remains the only way in which Australia addresses shared challenges in our region. By contrast, this government is using a range of economic tools to support economic stability and grow jobs in our region. We're providing bilateral loans to our most important near neighbours, PNG and Indonesia, at a crucial moment in their COVID-19 response efforts. The loan to Indonesia is part of our biggest package of economic support to South-East Asia since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. This government has established the $2 billion Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific, which is helping to deliver strategically significant projects, such as the Palau ICT cable project— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services (Senator Colbeck) to questions without notice asked by Senators Kitching and Gallagher today relating to COVID-19 vaccinations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Morrison promised that four million Australians would be vaccinated by the end of March. He has failed that test. Now it's the start of May, and we are only at 2.8 million. In fact the Prime Minister has failed pretty much every vaccine test that he has set himself. He promised that all of group 1a would be vaccinated by Easter. He failed that test. He promised that six million Australians would be vaccinated by 10 May. Monday has come and gone, and we're at 2.8 million. The Prime Minister has previously promised that all Australians will be vaccinated by the end of October. That seems impossible now, doesn't it? At the current rate of vaccination of 400,000 a week, we will not get there until 2023.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Weirdly, that's not what it says in the budget papers, is it? The budget papers assume that all Australians will be fully vaccinated this year. The Prime Minister is now backing away from that at a rate of knots. Yesterday he was trying very hard to distinguish, in his media appearance, between a policy setting and an assumption. That is a distinction that won't make sense to many Australians, and Senator Colbeck's answers today certainly did not make that any clearer. He spent a considerable amount of time today trying to distinguish between policy positions and assumptions and the grey zone of semantics between those ideas. But Australians actually don't need another word salad from this appalling minister, who oversaw a shambles of a response to the threat of COVID to aged-care residents. They actually just want a simple answer to a simple question: when will all of Australia be vaccinated?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not a moot question. It's not an unimportant question. The reason that the budget includes information—assumptions—about vaccination is that it has a real impact on Australia's ability to recover economically from the effects of the pandemic. A vaccinated Australia is less vulnerable to the risk posed when a positive case escapes from hotel quarantine. A vaccinated Australia won't have to have a widespread lockdown if community transmission is detected. A vaccinated Australian can travel, supporting vulnerable jobs in Cairns and in Launceston. That is the reality for many countries, and the Prime Minister promised us last year that we would be first in line and front of the queue for vaccines. According to analysis by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Times</span>, we're actually ranked 104th internationally in the rollout, and economists are telling us that all this delay caused by this incompetence will cost the Australian economy billions of dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that the Prime Minister should have and could have taken charge of personally. The Morrison government has badly mishandled sourcing vaccines, and today's announcement about sourcing Moderna vaccines is honestly long overdue. Labor has been calling for months now for the Australian government to strike a deal with Moderna for access to their state-of-the-art mRNA vaccine. That's a position that the government has consistently rejected as recently as the last few weeks. At the heart of this is the failure by Mr Morrison to take responsibility. He loves the job. He clearly loves the job. But he doesn't really like doing the work. He would rather lean on the state premiers. He wants a photo taken with them when things go right. He's nowhere to be seen when things go wrong. Just like in the bushfires, he's nowhere to be seen and unwilling to take responsibility for the things that really matter to this country, but he's always willing to point the finger, always finding someone else who is responsible for the things that have gone wrong, and he's never willing to stand up and actually take responsibility for the things that will make a difference in the lives of ordinary Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should stop pretending that the vaccine rollout is going well. They should stop blaming other people who draw attention to the failures. They should face up to the problems they have created, because Australians and the economy are paying the price.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I take pleasure in rising today to actually address this issue that Labor senators are raising in this place. What the government are proving is that we're ambidextrous in our ability to deal with the challenges of the supply of vaccine, our ability to connect with reality—something that we don't see much on the other side of the chamber. Professor Murphy said that it is absolutely vital for Australia to be prepared for variants of the coronavirus, and the Moderna deal which has been announced provides extra diversity and redundancy in the country's vaccine arsenal. This is phenomenal. This is great. We know that there have been supply constraints. We know that there have been issues, and it's your ability to deal with them when they arise—and that's what this government is proving: its ability to adapt, to shift, to work towards solutions. And that's what our Prime Minister and our health minister and the other great officials that are involved in negotiating terms and negotiating deals are doing to see the delivery of these vaccines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Morrison government is doing is proving its ability to be ambidextrous, to modify, to adapt as the circumstances change, and Australians can make sense of this. They get that. They respect the fact that, when circumstances change, you have to shift, you have to adapt and you have to move quickly. This is what the Morrison government has done in terms of this vaccine. With the announcement of an agreement for the Moderna vaccine, which secures a further 25 million doses, the total number of doses of vaccine that are going to be available to Australians has now increased to 195.4 million. That provides us with options. If there are issues, we can shift to others. There is opportunity that has been provided here by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, Labor have proven yet again their inability to adapt. They come in here with their same old and tired tactics of fear and cynicism in some misguided attempt to score some political point, but really they have no clue. All they're doing is just revealing that they don't have a clue about what Australians care about, because if they did then they would be coming in here and asking questions and inquiring about the very substantial budget statement that was delivered by the Treasurer. Labor's ability to adapt and move to where we need to go is really in question right now. It's a question that's before Labor and Labor members and people that support the Labor Party when they're looking at what Labor's position is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What will they do with the third round of tax cuts that this government has put forward? Where's Labor's position on this? Will they be ambidextrous? Will they present themselves with the ability to move and to shift and to recognise the times that we're dealing with? Australians care about this. This is something that Australians want to see. They want to be able to take home more of the money that they earn, but there is deathly silence on that side. We're not hearing what Labor would do. Mr Frydenberg said that if the opposition leader abandoned the government's tax cuts, which would abolish the 37 per cent tax bracket, leaving earnings between $45,000 and $200,000 taxed at 30 per cent, this would create a system that was unaffordable, and we must create a stronger system. Mr Frydenberg said that the Labor Party has not said if they have committed to stage 3. Even though at the time it passed through the parliament they said that they supported these tax cuts, there has been silence from the opposition leader. There has been silence from Labor senators as they've come and hid in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />If they abandon stage 3, it would mean that somebody on $80,000 a year, a middle-income earner, would be $900 a year worse off. These are the issues that Australians care about. These are the issues that are front of mind when Australians are working very hard and working hard to pay their bills. They want to know: can they keep more of the money that they earn? Where's Labor's interest in the Australian people, I wonder?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  I also rise to take note of questions from Senators Gallagher and Kitching to Senator Colbeck in relation to the failed vaccine rollout. You can see the penny dropping for senators opposite. It has been going on all week. On the other side they thought they had got away with the catastrophic bungling of the most important public health program in Australia's political history, vital for our public health, vital for the future of our economy. At the beginning of this week you could see in their faces as they came in here on the balls of their toes that they thought they'd got away with it, that the criticism had been muted. In fact what has happened is households across the country have just shrugged their shoulders because it's more of the same from the Morrison government. We've gone from, 'I don't hold a hose, mate' to 'I don't hold a dose, mate.' We've gone from broken promises, more announcements, more spin over the bushfire crisis to broken promises, more announcements, more spin and more marketing over another issue that's vital for public health, vital for the economy and vital for every household in the country. You could see it in the lacklustre tone—the excuses, the dissembling, the lack of interest, the lack of a sense of urgency—from Minister Colbeck in question time today. Just like when he had responsibility for aged care—remember, <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span> was the title of the report that made an assessment of his performance as the aged-care minister—everything that this minister touches turns to custard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 pandemic, for the government, has just been a distraction from what they see as the real business of government—staying in government and looking after themselves and their mates. We've had a cycle of announcements and promises over the COVID-19 vaccine rollout that has been accelerating as the sense of crisis and failure has risen. Last year, the Prime Minister promised that Australia would be at the front of the queue for vaccination. At the beginning of this year, the Prime Minister promised that four million Australians would be vaccinated by the end of March. Today, the promises and announcements accelerate, with five different positions from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and various assorted ministers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem for Minister Colbeck answering questions in the Senate today is that, while he's entitled to be confused about the government's position, it's really quite a simple proposition: if you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything; you just tell the truth. Well, the truth is that Australia has vaccinated just 2,736,107 people. We are 81st in the world in the percentage of our population vaccinated. In raw terms, there are 15 countries that have a smaller population that have vaccinated more people. It's a geography lesson, really. Singapore, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Serbia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, Belgium, Sweden, Portugal, Hungary, the Netherlands, Romania, Chile and Greece have all vaccinated more people and have a smaller population. Chile has six million fewer people than Australia and has fully vaccinated 16 million people in their population. Chile has fully vaccinated almost six times as many people as Australia has. How can it be that this country has performed so poorly?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been such wilful neglect of this basic requirement of government. This Prime Minister's not been able to grasp the nettle to do the right thing by Australians and Australian families and has left us stranded, exposed, isolated and vulnerable to future outbreaks of this virus, with a quarantine system that is fundamentally compromised. Unable to take responsibility for quarantines and vaccines, he's left Australian households at the mercy of the pandemic and a future economic crisis. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  I thank the Labor Party for raising this very important issue. Yes, we are still in the middle of an international pandemic, but the Labor Party continue to talk us down. They continue to talk down Australia, which has far exceeded the rest of the world in managing COVID cases and in ensuring we have best practice for testing, tracing and managing outbreaks of COVID. We have actually got through this pandemic with very low statistics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about the actual vaccination rollout, the sense of urgency that other countries have is not experienced here in Australia. We are getting the vaccination out the door. We are entering into negotiations with companies to ensure that we've got enough vaccine, going into the future, to ensure that we can vaccinate our entire population. Importantly, in a country like Australia that is so big and so diverse and that has such a disparate population, we are ensuring that we can manage to get the vaccine out to the people on the ground in the regions where it's needed. We are utilising every possible mechanism to get the vaccine out there. We are working with our general practices. We've got over 5,000 general practices registered to be able to give vaccinations. Those general practices are throughout Australia; they are not general practices located in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane. They are general practices like those in my home town of Deniliquin, where my local health clinic is giving COVID vaccinations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are working with the Aboriginal community controlled health services to ensure that our Aboriginal communities in some of the most remote locations in Australia are not forgotten as we manage the rollout of this vaccine. These are all things that take time to develop, but we've done that. They are all things that ensure that we are flexible and we can pivot to need. We're even working with the Royal Flying Doctor Service to ensure that people on our most remote stations have access to the vaccine. We're not focused only on where the pandemic has occurred in our cities, where we've had the majority of outbreaks. We are focused entirely on ensuring that every Australian who wants a vaccination can access a vaccination. We should be proud. Senator Ayres made the point that Australia is 81st in the world in terms of getting the vaccine rolled out. He failed to mention that our case numbers are 120th in the world. But, when you look at the number per capita, our case numbers are much, much lower than all of the countries that the Labor Party are focusing on comparing us to. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't want to be the next India. We don't want to be the next United Kingdom or the next USA. We want to make sure we stay ahead of the pack, so we are managing the entire pandemic. We are not focusing just on vaccinations. We know that the best way to get through this pandemic is to continue to ensure that we don't have major outbreaks, continue to work with our state partners of all political colours on their management of COVID and continue to ensure that we can manage any COVID coming to our country with returning Australians. We are working constructively through national cabinet to get the vaccine out the door. New South Wales last week opened their first major vaccination hub at Sydney Olympic Park. That has been going very successfully, with massive registrations of people, to bring forward the phases of the rollout as required, as advised by our health experts. We continue to listen to and we continue to work with the scientific community to manage this pandemic as we go. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MARIELLE SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  I also rise to take note of questions by senators Kitching and Gallagher to Senator Colbeck. What we got in the answers today was more waffle from a government far more focused on the politics of the vaccine rollout than the delivery of it. This is something we've come to expect after eight long years of this government that has always been far, far more focused on announcements than deliveries. We've seen it time and time again. The JobMaker program was meant to create 450,000 jobs, but only created 1,100. A federal integrity commission is nowhere to be seen. There is also the $4 billion in national disaster recovery that has not been spent. But this time the government have outdone themselves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've outdone themselves on the 'all announcement, no delivery', because this time they haven't just bungled the delivery; they've bungled the announcements. They announced that four million Australians would be vaccinated by the end of March, and they've failed to deliver that. It's now May and we've got about 2.8 million vaccinated. So they've tried to announce something again, and then they've failed to deliver the reannouncement. We've got five goes from five different ministers: Minister Hunt, who promised that all Australians would be vaccinated by October; Minister Tehan, who said that the goal was for all Australians to have a dose by the end of the year; Treasurer Frydenberg, who promised that every Australian would get two shots of the vaccine by the end of the year; Senator Birmingham, who said that people would still be getting vaccinated next year; and Minister Colbeck, who said that vaccinating Australians this year has never been part of the government's plans. There have been five different attempts at reannouncement from five different ministers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got to give you guys credit, because we thought we had you worked out. We thought we had your measure. We thought you were all announcement, no delivery. We thought you were great at the announcements—political geniuses at that—but always failing on the delivery. But you tricked us, because you can't even announce it properly. You're not only 'no announcement, no delivery'; you can't even do the announcements properly. There have been five different positions from five different ministers, five attempts at an announcement from five different ministers. It's ridiculously hard to keep up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that, in all these failures, the failures in delivery particularly, you're letting Australians down so very badly. It's not good enough to bungle this. It's one of your few jobs in the COVID recovery—vaccinations—and you're bungling it. It's not good enough for Australians. It's not good enough for vulnerable Australians, especially, who are still scared, who are still anxious, waiting for their vaccine. That vaccine for them is a ticket to a more normal life. It's a ticket to safety. It's a ticket to being able to go back into their community and not live with that deep-seated fear they live with every day. It's not good enough for our aged-care workers, who are going through an extraordinarily difficult time at the moment, with this anxiety on top of them. They're not all vaccinated yet. The fear they live with every day is intolerable. It's not good enough for our frontline healthcare workers, who are exhausted from this pandemic and who want to be vaccinated and are not yet vaccinated. It's not good enough for them. It's not good enough for all the Australians who need this vaccine and aren't able to get it. It's not good enough for our economy, because we know the reopening of our economy—the full redevelopment, the growth that we know we need to see in our economy—depends on jabs in arms, jabs you cannot deliver. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not good enough for our economy. It's not good enough for vulnerable Australians. It's not good enough for aged-care workers. It's not good enough for frontline healthcare workers. It's not good enough for any of us. So, instead of tying yourself in knots bungling announcements, and then go on and bungle the delivery of those announcements and reannouncements, which we just can't even catch up with, just do better. Do better for all Australians, who need you to do better on one of the few jobs you have. Do better for our economy. Do better for our vulnerable Australians. Do better on this vaccine rollout. Do better so that we can start getting back to normal. Do better so that people can be less anxious and less in fear. Just do better for Australia. It's about time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of all the untruths, of all the deception, of all the spin—in fact, if I could use some pub vernacular, Deputy President—of all the bullshit we hear in this place from the coalition about climate change, perhaps the biggest mistruth of all is that, somehow, there's a trade-off between the economy and action on climate change. There isn't. Action on climate change is important for the economy. It's not just an important opportunity to create new industries, new innovation, new jobs and solve an environmental problem. It's important because there is no bigger cost to our economy than climate change. There is no bigger threat to our national security than climate change.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How often do we think about the extreme weather events that cause the outages in power, that cause the problems we heard today at question time about a stable, reliable, low-cost energy source? Most of the problems in our grid are caused by heatwaves and cold snaps caused by our changing climate. There is the damage caused by prolonged droughts to our rural and regional areas—the lack of rainfall, the mental health issues—and there is the disruption to essential services and essential assets from cyclones, from floods, from heatwaves, from storms. We've all seen it. We've all experienced it. We're all giving this speech in Canberra, in the Australian Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just one summer ago, the summer leading into 2020, we experienced the most extraordinary period of extreme weather events and disruptions to the community, to the economy, to the areas in southern New South Wales all the way to the North Coast, down to Tasmania and across Victoria. We had Australian citizens being evacuated from beaches by the Australian Navy and the loss of millions of animals. The construction costs to communities to rebuild—that's just the tangible cost of what it costs to rebuild their houses and their infrastructure and their facilities. You can't even begin to estimate the cost and damage to their lives, to the fabric of their communities. But we ignore that in this place in our short-term, self-interested debates that we have on climate action. Somehow a technology that we've been talking about for 20 years is going to mysteriously solve our problems by creating lower emissions and a reliable, safe power source. I don't know if that's a pig that's flying over the Senate right now, but I tell you what: I'm fed up with this government's excuses and distractions from real climate change, and I know most Australians are as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson-Young mentioned today that this government has put up just 50c in every $100 that it's spent in this budget towards the environment and towards climate action. If there's anyone in this place, if there's any senator or any member of parliament, that can't say that the biggest challenge our nation faces—the biggest economic challenge, the biggest social challenge, the biggest environmental challenge, the biggest political challenge—is climate change, then they are quite simply in denial. They have their head in the sand. And, if that is the case, why has it had so little attention from this government? Indeed, why has this government thrown fuel on the fire by funding fossil fuels? Shamefully, we just saw that in the Senate this afternoon with legislation gagged to provide public funds for fossil-fuel projects. The public expect a lot better from us, and the Greens will deliver on that for the Australian public at the next election.</span>

The committee has recently reviewed the rules and has again emphasised that the use of remote participation should be strictly limited to enable senators to participate in Senate proceedings while they are prevented from physically attending the Senate because of COVID-19 related travel restrictions, quarantine requirements or personal health advice.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's budget is a budget for the bush. It follows on from the regional budget of last year to cement our government's commitment to rural and regional Australia. Despite the challenges of the past few years in the regions, with drought, flood, fire and now a mouse plague, our regional industries have carried this nation through the COVID pandemic, and that is why our regional investment is the right thing to do for the nation and for our ongoing economic recovery. The pandemic has changed the way we view our regions. With 43,000 Australians opting to make the move from the city to the regions, it is vital that we as a government invest in the infrastructure and services needed to ensure our regions remain the best places in the world to live. From my perspective, regional New South Wales is certainly the best place to live, but it will be even better, thanks to the commitment of the Nationals in this government to continue to deliver services over the great divide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time ever this is a health budget specifically focused on the almost eight million Australians who live and work in the regions. All Australians, regardless of where they live, should have access to high-quality health care, and that is what we as a government are delivering. To do this we know that we must attract, train and retain doctors in the bush. That is why we are investing for the long term. This year we saw the first intake into the Murray-Darling medical schools, with three of the five campuses located in New South Wales and the campuses in Wagga Wagga and Orange accepting students from February this year. As well as piloting new workforce programs in New South Wales to better support our young doctors, including working with the Murrumbidgee Local Health District, our government is developing a streamlined program to support the National Rural Generalist Pathway and complementing that with training for early-career allied health professionals through an expanded allied health rural generalist pathway. But we know we also need an immediate measure to help our existing regional doctors, and that is why we are providing a new, progressive bulk-billing schedule to better acknowledge the remoteness under the Medicare Benefits Schedule. We understand doctors face greater health complexities and challenges in regional and remote areas, and that is why more than 12,000 GPs across the nation will be eligible for this higher bulk-billing incentive, but only GPs based in regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also looking after those who've looked after us. Rural, regional and remote communities will see improvements to residential aged-care funding models, an expansion of home-care packages, direct funding for infrastructure upgrades and greater support for our aged-care workforce. We are also acutely aware of the need to look after our mental as well as our physical health: $2.3 billion is being invested into mental health and suicide prevention, the largest investment in Australia's history. That includes a new national network of 57 additional mental health treatment centres and satellites as well as expansion of the very successful headspace program, and this will all bolster services for young and old in the bush.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals have always advocated for better communications in regional areas. We fought for and implemented the Mobile Black Spot Program, which in New South Wales has now seen 284 mobile towers delivered. We've also developed and we are delivering the Regional Connectivity Program, which enables communities to identify the right local solution for better online digital access. Already in New South Wales 15 projects have been funded, including mobile voice and data coverage, fixed wireless, and fibre broadband services. This includes projects like the Murrumbateman fixed wireless network and the connecting the outback project in Boggabri.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this budget provides business and personal tax relief. The instant asset write-off has been a boon for small business and farmers across the nation. I personally know of farm machinery suppliers who are struggling to keep up with demand because of the success of this program, so we're extending it. Further to this, over three million low- and middle-income earners in New South Wales alone will receive tax relief of up to about $1,080 over the financial year, and it would be remiss of me not to mention the increased excise rebate for small distilleries and independent brewers. In New South Wales there are 87-plus small distilleries who will benefit from the increase from $100,000 to $350,000 for this rebate, which brings them in line with our very successful wine industry. When this move was announced, it was within hours that I got my first letter from a small distiller saying they are now going to advertise for more staff and reinvest, because with distilleries and breweries, like wineries, a dollar invested in their business is multiple dollars invested in their communities as they boost regional tourism and the hospitality sector as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As ever, the Nationals are committed to our regional infrastructure. Roads, rail and freight keep our people moving. We know local roads are just as important as our major highways and corridors. That is why we are investing $278.5 million more in the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program rolled out by local governments and $270 million in New South Wales alone for road safety projects. We are finally investing in the Great Western Highway to improve the flow of traffic over the Great Dividing Range from Katoomba to Lithgow. Our commitment to Inland Rail is ongoing, and we are increasing commitment to the Building Better Regions Fund, providing a sixth round. This fund has already seen 249 projects in New South Wales alone—projects like the Orange City Council central business district revitalisation or the Eurobodalla Regional Botanic Gardens visitor centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And jobs; we are always committed to jobs. This budget increases our JobTrainer package to see ongoing investment into the future workforce that we need to support our industries. Working with the states, we're providing free or low-fee access to courses for in-demand industries like agriculture, manufacturing and construction—industries so important to our regional economies. We've also extended the apprenticeship wage subsidy measure, which has been so successful at enabling employers to take on and train new staff—new staff, new skilled work men and women who will then go on to service our towns and our industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could not be more proud of this budget. I could not be more proud of the team I work with to ensure that this budget is focused not just on where our major population centres are but on where our economy is driven from. It is our regional economy, the resources sector, the agricultural sector, that has kept us ticking over for the last few years, and particularly during this pandemic. So I congratulate the government and I congratulate my colleagues. I commend this budget and our regional budget statement to the chamber.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  As leader of the National Party in the Senate, I too want to speak to the tabling of the ministerial regional budget statement, <span style="font-style:italic;">Supporting regional recovery and growth</span>, a specific set of plans, commitments and strategies to really prioritise rural and regional Australia as we enter COVID-19 recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we in the National Party know—we live, we work, we raise our families out there in the regions—it's been tough. We've had drought in Senator McDonald's patch for upwards of seven years. Thanks to some great rains in the New Year, there were a lot of smiling faces at Beef Week in Rockhampton last week. We also were hit by bushfires over the summer 18 months ago. Recovery is tough when overnight you lose everything that you and your family had worked for. Obviously COVID-19 has had a significant impact on rural and regional Australia. We've struggled to find a workforce, with international borders closed. Sadly, as many premiers slammed close state and domestic borders due to COVID-19, we saw rural and regional communities in those border towns severely impacted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the budget of 2021, I'm very proud to be part of a coalition government that backs in the resourcefulness, the resilience, the strength and the opportunity of rural and regional communities. We're getting on with it out there. This budget supports jobs and drives growth. It's going to help rebuild the national economy, which you do in a country like Australia by focusing on manufacturing, by focusing on ensuring our resources sector is strong and by focusing on agriculture. This budget has some great measures for all three of those areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You also do it through an infrastructure commitment that doesn't focus just on roads, rail and bridges. These are incredibly important to get product and people moving along the highways and byways of regional communities to the ports in capital cities and export markets around the globe. But it is also digital connectivity, digital infrastructure, that's going to be incredibly important going forward, not just so we can educate our kids, do our banking or participate in social connection but so we can access health care and drive productivity growth in our businesses and on farms. There are some fantastic, innovative initiatives occurring in this space which I'm very excited to see going forward. Other National Party senators tonight will be participating in this contribution by highlighting how our government has delivered for each and every state and for communities right around our country, and I know they're as happy as I am that we can get this going.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The biosecurity announcement, championed by David Littleproud, is fundamental to our ongoing success as an agricultural trading nation. We have a brand globally that people trust because when they buy our clean, green produce it is pest and disease free. Because it comes from Australia, they can trust that that is the case. But as trade and the movement of people across the globe increases so too does the risk. Our reputation as a global exporter of great agricultural products could be tarnished through lax biosecurity, so I'm stoked to see that there is to be $400 million invested in biosecurity measures to safeguard our farmers from pest and diseases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got $87 million on the table to diversify our markets. That is particularly important in light of the recent trade tensions between Australia and China—noting that tariffs have recently left local producers of wine, seafood, cotton, barley and beef out in the cold. And it's working. This money puts agricultural counsellors in our embassies to help connect producers to potential opportunities in new and emerging markets. It's very, very important to have a people-to-people, networked relationship that can build trust. North-east Victorian wine growers have told me they've spent years building markets in China only to have orders cancelled, so this is very welcome news.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got money for the Future Drought Fund, and I want to touch, Madam Acting Deputy President, on water. I'm from the great state of Victoria. We have significant primary producers within the Murray-Darling Basin system and we have significant population centres within that system. We say no to the 450-gigalitre buyback, and the budget backs this with $1.3 billion to recover water for the environment in the Murray-Darling Basin whilst maintaining water for irrigated agriculture. We're also providing a further $22.3 million to help develop business cases for eight water infrastructure projects, to help secure our water future. Out in the regions we know that, if you add water to our can-do, Australian farmers will go from strength to strength in producing world class food and fibre. There are two projects based in my home state: the Coliban Regional Rural Modernisation project and the Sunbury-Bulla-Keilor Agricultural Rejuvenation project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobs are a huge focus in this budget. We've heard farmers calling out for fruit pickers because worker and skill shortages have had serious ramifications for their production and bottom line. Our budget's AgMove initiative will help with relocation assistance to get workers into jobs on farms. We've seen a massive shift in Australia during COVID. Australians have been realigning their values, having a rethink about the type of life they want to live. Do they want to be stuck in a two-bedroom apartment in Southbank? No. It's not much of a life if Daniel Andrews is going to lock you down every second for weeks and months on end. Rather, they're voting with their feet. Twenty-six thousand Melburnians have moved out. We're hoping they don't all go to the Sunshine Coast. We hope that they come out to our regional capitals and live and raise a family there with the increased digital connectivity that our government has provided over the last eight years and will continue to develop and grow. They will be able to participate in global economies and stay connected with jobs across the world whilst having a unique liveability that only living in the regions can provide. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget is also backing our youth with an apprenticeship and skills plan that wants to see not only young people in particular but all Australians move into the jobs of the future. It's not enough just saying 'job available'; you've got to match the skill set, the know-how and the education offering for Australians to take advantage of those opportunities. We also want sophisticated advanced manufacturing out in the regions as we turn that beautiful primary product into a highly value-added advanced manufacturing food or fibre product. I'm super excited with what we're already doing out there but making sure we have a highly skilled workforce to meet that demand is something that this budget addresses. We also address the resource opportunities out there. We want to make sure that the energy and gas-powered opportunities that will drive additional manufacturing opportunities through the regions are also supported by this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm particularly excited about the values underpinning this budget. That is about personal income tax and business incentives that help businesses invest back into themselves so they can employ more Australians. We know out in rural and regional Australia that has been a super successful program that we extend in this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural and regional Australia drive our national economy. Our government absolutely backs the regions in to not just recover from COVID-19, bushfires and droughts but, with this budget, build them back better. I'm super excited to be part of a government that's absolutely committed to growth and development in rural and regional Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="123072" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  I'm incredibly pleased to speak today on the budget, focusing particularly on the regional Australia element. This would have to be a period of enormous opportunity and growth for the regions in Australia. Despite the incredible impacts of COVID-19, it has been the regions that have continued to power this country. I particularly think of all the workforce in mining camps and agricultural parts of the country who had to go through that initial lockdown period. Those workers had to make the decision to move to a state or a part of the country, sometimes leaving their families behind for a very long period of time, while they dug in and committed to ensuring that Australia continued staying at work, continued mining, continued agriculture, and continued feeding this country. That of course also includes the truck drivers of this nation, the supply chains of this country, that just kept on keeping on despite the challenges of border crossings, of COVID tests and of being away from home. We know that our truck drivers have all the challenges across the land with not enough amenities, and that is something that I know the state governments and territories will be focused on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional Australia, though, is made up of not only industries but also, most importantly, communities and people. So, whilst I'm particularly excited about the $10 billion worth of infrastructure development commitment to regional Australia, I want to touch on a couple of them, like the $400 million for the inland freight route from Mungindi to Charters Towers. This is incredibly important for our truck and transport operators, who are having to deal with roads that have not been maintained sufficiently by that state government. This will give them a safer and smoother passage to transport animals, goods and, sometimes, people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Money—$240 million—has also been made available for the Cairns Western Arterial Road duplication. Again, this is an important part of allowing our northern Queensland communities to develop. The instant asset write-off—touched on so many times over the last few months—has been an incredible boon to agricultural, mining and other businesses, allowing them to reinvest in capital that improves their businesses and to establish themselves for years to come. That is incredibly important. This budget is not just about money that will be used in the short term; it is about establishing the regions for a generation to come. The telehealth program, which leapt forward by maybe as much as 10 years, allows Australians, particularly in regional Australia, to contact their doctors and to have consultations without leaving their homes. Remember, in regional Australia a doctor might be hours away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget has particularly reinvested in the northern Australia agenda. The northern Australia reinsurance pool—$10 billion over 10 years—will ensure that people who've bought into units, families in homes, people in businesses, can continue to access capital in the north. Of course you cannot do this without insurance, and certainly the insurance market in northern Queensland had failed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on some of those community elements that I mentioned earlier, like the idea of committing to preschool places for Australian children. We know that the education of three- and four-year-olds has a significant and long-lasting benefit on their later educational outcomes. The increase of the child-care subsidy, in part, will affect around 250,000 families. The preschool places will apply to children who live right across this country. We know we have about 1,500 children being educated by distance education because of their geographical isolation. How terrific that that will extend to them!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to correct an earlier statement. I believe I said $10 billion; it's $110 billion of rolling infrastructure program over the next 10 years. This is a huge amount of money. It is very significant for developing the part of the country where we grow the food and fibre, we mine the resources and we raise our families. It is a terrific part of the world to be in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Australia Beef Roads Program is also a terrific program. Mayors right across the state have called for it, but there's been no greater advocate than the mayor of the Blackall-Tambo shire, Andrew Martin. All the shires between there and Rockhampton have been calling for additional funds. This budget has committed another $100 million towards the Northern Australia Beef Roads Program. We know that improving roads improves safety for truck drivers and it also improves animal welfare outcomes for beef cattle. It means that cattle are transported in a way that has less impact on them and they lose less weight—a terrific outcome for everybody involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Water projects have already been touched on by Senator McKenzie. I'll touch on those in the great state of Queensland and particularly the Big Rocks Weir at Charters Towers where $30 million has been committed by the federal government. We are now just waiting for the Queensland government to discover where Charters Towers is so that they too can support the town water supply that this Big Rocks Weir will address. Money has also been made available to Geoscience Australia for the Great Artesian Basin water balance model. How important is this! We'll finally get more accurate information on the water that is available from our terrific water resource in the Great Artesian Basin and understand the recharges and the aquifers that surround it. There's $24 million for the Hells Gate Dam, in addition to the Big Rocks Weir. The Hughenden irrigation scheme business case has $10 million. There is $11 million for that terrific project, the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme efficiency improvement. And, of course, there's $3 million for the Upper Burdekin feasibility study.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on and on and on about all the terrific announcements in this budget and in recent months, but I specifically want to finish on the amazing support for regional aviation in this country. With the shutdowns that we experienced at the beginning of the COVID crisis last year, we discovered just how much is carried by our regional airlines. It's not just people; it's also freight, medicine, specialists flying to places like Mount Isa to provide cancer treatments. These are all critical areas that are supported by the airline industry. It was immediately apparent to the minister for transport, and he developed the Domestic Aviation Network Support scheme, commonly known as DANS, and the Regional Airline Network Support scheme, RANS. This has been supported by the Remote Airstrip Upgrade Program, with $8.2 million in funding, which is improving emergency landing strips across the north. Of course, there is the Regional Airports Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Something that has been little discussed is the Women in the Aviation Industry Initiative. Currently, women in aviation make up only about four per cent of pilots, and even less, as you'd imagine, of the engineers and maintenance crew. So this $4 million of funding assistance will allow support for women to have opportunities to get into the aviation sector—a terrific sector, an incredibly important one in a nation as great and as large as ours. I reflect on the founders of Qantas Airways, who talked about the tyranny of distance and how aviation can solve some of those problems for regional Australia. That is another important element of this incredibly regionally focused budget—something that I'm very proud of and that I know will establish regional Australia for another generation to come.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282728" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McMAHON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  I rise to welcome and commend the statement by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development on rural and regional budget outcomes. This is a good budget for the Northern Territory—a great budget for the Northern Territory. But, let's face it: every federal budget is great for the Northern Territory because, without it, we would flounder and we would not be able to provide the great services that we need to provide to Territorians. Years of economic mismanagement by successive Labor governments have left us broke. So, unfortunately at the moment, we rely almost solely on the federal government for infrastructure and for running many of our vital programs, such as health, education and remote policing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the inability of some senators opposite to either understand or appreciate the positive commitments by the coalition government to the Northern Territory's economic future, the 2021-22 budget has a huge amount in it for Territorians. The only road to nowhere is the one between the ears of some senators opposite, because within this budget is a long list of infrastructure expenditure which is already underway, and the biggest obstacle to the rollout of these commitments is the inability of their political mates—the Gunner Labor government—to keep up with the funding we provide. If the Northern Territory government could in fact keep up, if it had the capacity to deliver with the current funding available, then the coalition government could make money available for projects that are vital for Territorians, such as improved roads and other vital infrastructure that allows us to travel around our 1.4 million square kilometres. But the Northern Territory government doesn't have the capacity. They don't have the capacity and they don't have the competency to deliver many of these projects. In fact, they are going to add an additional 44 public servants to the 21,000 Territory public servants just so they can try and keep up with the amount of projects being funded by the federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at infrastructure spending, the federal budget has allocated more than $323 million for road infrastructure in the Northern Territory. This includes $150 million for the NT national network highway upgrades, which will result in safer travel and reduced travel times and boost employment across the Northern Territory, building on the $46 million provided earlier for priority sections of the Stuart, Victoria and Barkly highways. There is more than $173 million for gas roads around the Beetaloo Basin to support the gas industry—but not only the gas industry, because these roads are also used by pastoralists, used by people for remote Indigenous communities and used by people providing services to those cattle stations and remote communities. There is more than $4.3 million for the Alice Springs to Darwin corridor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, if we look at Our North, Our Future, there's $189.6 million in the 2021-26 package which supports the government's JobMaker plan and the Modern Manufacturing Strategy, which is something that we in the Nationals are very passionate about. This will also support the gas-fired recovery program and the Ag2030 agenda to boost Australia's agricultural production.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">New measures for northern Australia include piloting of a regions-of-growth approach worth $9.3 million over five years. The regions-of-growth pilot program will provide specialists to help connect businesses to economic opportunities in areas such as advanced manufacturing, critical minerals development or in agriculture. A northern Australia development program worth $111.9 million over five years will help businesses scale up and diversify and build resilience through the northern Australian development co-investment grants program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at regional connectivity—so important to us in the north—the government has provided $130.4 million to improve connectivity in rural, regional and remote communities, further driving Australia's regionally-led recovery from the COVID-19 impact. The pandemic has shown many Australians the value of regions like the Northern Territory, both as economic powerhouses and as desirable destinations to live, work and raise a family. This government recognises that regional communities need improvements to their connectivity in order to take advantage of this so-called 'regional migration' of people moving out of the cities and into the regions. And we in the Northern Territory certainly welcome the people that have chosen to make the Northern Territory somewhere where they live and work throughout this pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also welcome schemes such as the reinsurance pool, a $10 billion government guarantee to make insurance affordable and accessible for those who live in areas that are plagued by floods and cyclones. This pool is going to reduce insurance premiums across northern Australia by over $1.5 billion. This will go to households, strata title and small businesses over 10 years—again, vital in the Northern Territory, where we're subject regularly to both cyclones and floods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at a summary of the infrastructure spend in the Northern Territory, bearing in mind that the Northern Territory has one per cent of Australia's population, in the current budget year for infrastructure we have a 2.5 per cent share of the budget; in the forward estimates we have a 2.1 per cent share; of the 10-year pipeline we have a 2.3 per cent share; and over the last 10 years we have had a 2.2 per cent share. So, in every single aspect of that infrastructure spend, we are getting well and truly double what we should be entitled to compared to our population and the national average. This shows this government's commitment to the people of the Northern Territory and to the people of rural and regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just say to those who seek to be critical of this budget: from a Northern Territory perspective, this budget has been endorsed and in fact praised by our Chief Minister, Michael Gunner; the employment minister, Paul Kirby; the Leader of the Opposition, Lia Finocchiaro; and major industry groups such as Group Training Northern Territory, Master Builders Northern Territory and the Chamber of Commerce Northern Territory. Hospitality and tourism have endorsed this budget and very much welcomed the announcement on student visas. Whilst we look forward to jobs creation, one of the issues that we have at the moment in the Northern Territory, particularly in the agriculture, tourism and hospitality industries, is actually getting people to work in these industries. So we very much welcome the announcement of an increase to the number of hours able to be worked by our international students, to allow these students to fill gaps for tourism and hospitality. And we obviously have our schemes for the agriculture sector as well, to attract Australians to come and work in agriculture in the Northern Territory. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Education Legislation Amendment (2021 Measures No. 2) Bill 2021 primarily amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Higher Education Support Act 2003 </span>(HESA)<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and makes minor amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Education Services for Overseas Act 2000 </span>(ESOS Act).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 1<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"></span>of the Bill<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>amends HESA to expand the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) to include resident return visa holders who previously held a permanent humanitarian visa. Currently, the travel component of a permanent humanitarian visa ceases after a five-year period. If a permanent humanitarian visa holder travels outside of Australia outside of that timeframe, they must apply for a resident return visa to retain permanent residence in Australia. A former permanent humanitarian visa holder in this situation would no longer be eligible for a HELP loan under HESA, even though, if they had not travelled outside of the travel component of their visa, they would have retained their original visa and eligibility for HELP assistance. The resident return visa is a permanent visa, and permanent visa holders are not generally eligible for HELP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The very intent of HELP is to make higher education more accessible to students who may not otherwise have access. As a permanent humanitarian visa holder in this situation would have retained their HELP eligibility if they had not travelled outside of their travel facility, this Bill ensures permanent humanitarian visa holders can still access HELP, ensuring continued access to quality tertiary education while they are Australian residents.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I turn to the measures in the Bill that amend the ESOS Act. The ESOS Act ensures quality education and training, provides tuition assurance and complements Australia's migration laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ESOS Act amendments arise from the Government's focus to ensure continuity of assistance and quality for overseas students and demonstrates the Government's commitment to good governance and the effective and efficient legislative oversight of Australia's international education sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill builds on measures the Morrison government has already put in place to support the international education sector through the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including significant regulatory and fee relief that has reduced red tape and simplified the regulatory environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In summary, the amendments will continue to protect students, keep providers focussed on meeting their obligations to students and ensure the sustainability of the Overseas Students Tuition Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ESOS Act provides important protections for students. It ensures rigorous standards are applied to any course delivered to international students, beyond the existing strong domestic regulations. It protects international students' investment in an Australian education and upholds the integrity of the visa system. These requirements will remain. Overseas students will continue to receive these protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The measures in this Bill demonstrate the Government's commitment to ensuring higher education in Australia is accessible, affordable and fair and will assure the efficient functioning of HESA, the ESOS Act and the Tuition Protection Service.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(i) is a cynical attempt by the Morrison Government to pretend it cares about the issues and Australians it has ignored in the last seven.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a week it's been—a budget handed down by Mr Frydenberg that really has one singular achievement, and it's a curious achievement indeed. How is it that a party that came to government essentially on a platform of denigrating and criticising the Rudd government's approach to the greatest financial crisis that the globe has ever seen, campaigning against what they said was debt and deficit as far as the eye could see, can, just a few years later, in government, spend hundreds of billions of dollars bringing the country into a place where our fiscal position really is that we are $1 trillion in debt, with nothing to show for it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How is such a thing possible? How is it possible to put the country into a position where we have a $1 trillion debt, but wages are going to fall? How is it possible that hundreds of billions of dollars of public money can be spent—$1 trillion in debt—but infrastructure spending is cut? How is it possible to spend $1 trillion of public money—hundreds of billions of dollars this year—and have no big reform? There's nothing in the budget to improve national productivity; there's nothing to improve national resilience. That is a curious achievement indeed from a stale, old government, eight years old, that is asking the Australian people for more years than the Howard government got. How is it possible that this government can sustain this proposition? I think I heard it best on Radio National this morning, when one of the people being interviewed said, very dismissively, 'This is the "believe it when I see it budget".'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians know that the Morrison government is all promise and no delivery—all announcement, no delivery. But, even this week, for all the billions of dollars that have been shovelled out the door, the promises and the announcements haven't made it to the end of the week. Poor old Minister Colbeck was on his feet today—I did feel sorry for him—having to defend the entirely indefensible on a matter as crucial to our national economic recovery as an effective vaccine rollout. Poor old Minister Colbeck. I know it's terrible. We tease him in here from time to time, because he stumbles over his stuff, and he gets his briefs confused. But, really, you could have been 21, a Harvard graduate, and not be able to defend the performance of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, Minister Tehan and Minister Hunt, who said four different things today about whether or not the government's actually committed to a target for the vaccine rollout. How is it that we've ended up with poor old National Party senators in here trying to defend the government's performance on infrastructure spending in Queensland and the Northern Territory? Almost all of it's after the forward estimates. You'd have to vote for these jokers not one more time, but two more times. To see a single shovel out there, to see a single steamroller, to see anything go on in any of these infrastructure projects, it would have to be a government that would get more than the Howard government got. It would have to be a government that would get more than Hawke and Keating got. You'd be touching the Robert Menzies period in government in order to achieve these things. But it's an eight-year-old, tired government that's out of ideas. The only thing that's left are announcements and promises. You'd get more years than John Howard got.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer said, 'Our first priority is to keep Australians safe from COVID.' He announced some extra money for the vaccine program. It's not clear at all what the target is. Contrast it with what President Biden has done, which is set ambitious, stretched targets for the Americans, which they have met and exceeded every time.  There's not a cent for quarantine. There's promise after promise that they'll expand capacity, but no commitment to quarantine. That's why they've let Australians of Indian background down so badly over the course of the last fortnight. They deliberately excluded the 40,000 Australians trying to get home, especially those 9½ thousand Australians stuck in India. They were locked out and then threatened with being locked up. They're in that position because of this government's failure on the vaccine rollout and on quarantine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How is it that you have a budget that spends hundreds of billions of dollars, but universities are going to be cut by nearly 10 per cent? The country can't go forwards if universities go backwards. I'll give you a clue. Do you know where they develop vaccines? They develop them in university laboratories. Do you know where they develop solutions to the big problems that the country faces? They develop them at universities. Where do they educate the next generation of Australians who are going to take the country forward and do the things that are needed to meet the challenges of the future? They're educated in our university sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this so-called tax relief, the Treasurer promised that low- and middle-income earners would have more of their money in their pockets to spend across the economy, so creating jobs. Well, that's just entirely dishonest. In the budget papers, in truth, the government is projecting a real wage cut. The cost of living is going to rise by 3.25 per cent. Real wages, for most Australians, will continue to fall. That means low- and middle-income Australians face a decline in their standard of living because of the choices that this government has made. Budgets really matter. They particularly matter if there's a relationship between what you say and what you do, and this budget will impoverish Australian families. There is absolute hypocrisy in the government's approach to tax cuts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Tuesday night the Treasurer promised more support for homeownership. But the consensus amongst economists is that everything the government has done here will make housing more out of reach for ordinary Australians, will make the dream of homeownership impossible for most Australian families. They've announced just 10,000—a drop in the ocean—first home owner grants and 10,000 additional grants for single mothers. But there are nearly half a million low- and very low-income households across Australia in unaffordable rental housing, and, on the government's figures, all of those households are facing a cut to their income. Research from last year found that there were 240,000 women aged 55 or older at risk of homelessness, and another 165,000 women in that position aged 45 to 54. Many of those people were in our regional cities. If you go to Wagga Wagga, Dubbo, Wellington, Nowra, Lismore or Grafton, you'll find those families sleeping in cars or living in tents with little kids or sleeping under bridges with no prospect of decent housing because of the decisions that this government has made. Families in the suburbs, middle-income families, have no prospect of being able to afford their own home because of decisions that this government has made. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On skills and training, the Treasurer promised a record investment in skills and training. Here's what their friends in the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Australian</span> wrote about the package: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">After years of the government rebadging skills programs, the dismal failure of last year's headline-grabbing JobMaker scheme, is a reminder of the need to be sceptical about skills announcements. … you'd have to be a foundation member of the Coalition cheer squad to accept this year's promises on apprenticeships and skills will end up being delivered over the forward estimates, given the government's record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you remember JobMaker? I do. In the budget papers it was buried at page 248, four pages from the back. The centrepiece of last year's budget is being covered up and covered over. Why? Because it promised 450,000 jobs and delivered just 1,000. And the truth for those 1,000 people—the lucky 1,000 people who got a job out of this bunch of jokers—is that they face real wage cuts. The government's history on skills and training is utterly embarrassing. The best guarantee, of course, of future performance is an assessment of past performance. While there are all these big promises and big announcements, what's the truth of the matter on the government's performance in terms of apprenticeships and traineeships? There are 140,000 fewer of them. The PaTH program promised to get 120,000 Australians into a job. How many did it get? Well, it did better than JobMaker. It got 36,290 into a job. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">An agenda with 3 guiding principles that will drive Labor in Government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">An economy that delivers for working families. Investing in Australia's future. No one held back and no one left behind.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We have a once in a century opportunity to reinvent our economy; to lift wages and make sure they keep rising; to invest in advanced manufacturing and in skills and training with public TAFE at its heart; to provide affordable childcare; to fix aged care; to address the housing crisis; to champion equality for women; and to emerge as a renewable energy superpower.</span>

Forget the phony rejection of austerity, forget the about-face on debt and deficit, forget the superficial concern with women's economic security, because, once you scratch the surface of this budget, you will see that, like the last seven budgets this government has delivered, it is built on the con that is trickle-down economics. This budget proposes no change to the fundamentals of our economy or to the tax and transfer system. The neoliberal train is rolling ever onward, barrelling through everything in its path, ruining lives, destroying nature and cooking the planet. And upfront in the locomotives are the LNP, shovelling coal into the firebox to keep the neoliberal train rolling on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget was handed down while the planet's climate is breaking down around us, threatening the very existence of life, and while the destruction of ecosystems is already causing a rate of species extinction that is epoch-defining. This budget has been handed down while economic inequality is spiralling out of control. The billionaires are accumulating feudal-era levels of wealth while real wages are going backwards and millions of Australians are forced to subsist below the poverty line. House prices are spiralling out of control, pricing an entire generation out of the great Australian dream of owning their own home—an entire generation forced to either make a Faustian pact with their bank and live a life of debt or be at the mercy of their landlord, who can increase their rent or terminate their tenancy on a whim. And, more than a century after being given the right to vote and decades after countless reforms meant to create equal opportunity for women, women are still being disadvantaged. There is an epidemic of family violence, and the toxic attitudes of far too many men towards women are still persistent and pervasive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do we get in this budget? What does this budget do to respond to the big social, economic and environmental issues of our time? We get business as usual. Sure, some of the rhetoric has shifted, and, sure, there are some good things in this budget, as there are in any budget, but, underneath it, the same superstructure that created the climate crisis, that is enriching the already superwealthy, that is empowering the big corporations and that is perpetuating patriarchal attitudes and behaviours remains. In some cases, such as the spending of even more public money to help big corporations make even more profit from burning coal and gas, this budget is quite literally adding more fuel to the fire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in many cases, it's what's not in this budget that matters, such as all the inequalities and rorts in the tax system that have gone untouched and that will continue to disadvantage young people and women and anyone else who is not in favour with the LNP. The budget provides no solution to the climate crisis, no response to escalating wealth inequality and no credible plan to increase wages or to lift people out of poverty. True to type, what this budget has done is deliver for the government's mates. This is a budget that should have been and was welcomed by the big corporates and the billionaires. This government was never going to do anything other than look after the big corporates and the billionaires, because this government exists to serve its political masters and donors. That is exactly what this budget does. That is exactly why the LNP are in this place. That is in their DNA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nowhere is this government's enslavement to its corporate donors and corporate masters more evident than in its archaic attachment to fossil fuels. Governments and markets around the world are changing tack and decarbonising at a rapid pace. The world is transitioning to a clean energy future as the urgency of the climate crisis becomes impossible to avoid. The US is on board. China is on board. The EU is on board. Left or right, democratic or totalitarian, government led or market led, it doesn't matter; the switch is on. The only question left is whether the switch will be fast enough to stop a catastrophic collapse in the ecosystems that sustain life on earth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But is Australia on board with the switch? No. Is the government on board with the switch? Oh no, it's not. Their determination is not only to resist change but to actually fight against it. It is as astonishing as it is insane. In this budget, the Morrison government is giving yet another billion dollars in new public subsidies to the oil, gas and coal sectors, on top of the over $50 billion in public subsidies that were already headed their way. Their showcase derangement is the so-called gas-led recovery, a shameful exercise in corporate welfare for the rent seekers using yesterday's technology. It's all about giving public money to LNP donors to build polluting power plants that will push up power bills and will further fuel the climate crisis. Gas use by Australians is going down each and every year, and government money for new gas that is contained in this budget is nothing but a white elephant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia should be moving to become a world leader in batteries, renewables and green hydrogen. We have a chance to supply the world not only with clean energy but with clean resources—steel, aluminium, other metals refined by using our abundant supply of renewable resources. But such is the political-industrial nexus between the Liberal Party and the fossil fuel industry, the government is willing to squander that opportunity in its determination to prop up a dying industry. That's why they've served up yet another budget that sells out our children's future for the sake of the big corporates and the superwealthy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of political donations, during the pandemic when every economic indicator went backwards in this country and when hundreds of thousands of Australians were put out of work, Australia's billionaires increased their wealth by 34 per cent—that is, by $90 billion in one year, in the middle of a global pandemic, when millions of Australians were unemployed or underemployed. This is nothing short of obscene and it's an obscenity aided and abetted by this government. It's not a bug; it's a feature of this government's policy settings. Sixty-five of Australia's largest companies were given $1.2 billion in JobKeeper payments even though they recorded a profit during the pandemic. This included $21 million to Harvey Norman, who paid dividends which helped Gerry Harvey grow his personal wealth by $600 million last year.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator McKIM:</span>
                  </a>  It is disgusting. How has this budget responded to the JobKeeper rort and the obscene accumulation of wealth? Well, I can't say it any better than Gerry Harvey, who said yesterday, 'They've thrown a heap of money at us.' Well, they sure have thrown a heap of money at Gerry Harvey and Australia's other billionaires. Straight out of Gerry Harvey's mouth: this is a budget for the billionaires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, this can't be allowed to go unchecked. The Greens would introduce a billionaire's tax, a permanent six per cent tax on the net wealth of the richest 200 Australians that would increase revenue by $5 billion every year—money we could use to fund essential public services in this country and accelerate a transition to renewable energy and reforestation to draw down carbon and reduce our carbon emissions. We would also introduce a pandemic profiteering levy, a one-off 50 per cent tax on the increase on net wealth of billionaires last year; that would raise $29 billion. The Greens would also require those companies that received JobKeeper but that remained profitable to pay the JobKeeper payments back. This would return over $1 billion to the public purse that never should have left it in the first place.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator McKIM:</span>
                  </a>  Absolutely. Together, these measures would help stop the outrageous accumulation of wealth by the superwealthy and go some way towards restoring the notion of a fair go in Australia. The Greens would also introduce a mining superprofits tax. Not surprisingly, the billionaires who did the best of all in the pandemic are those in the resources sector. Gina Rinehart, Clive Palmer and Twiggy Forrest all more than doubled their wealth during the pandemic. These are the very same people who fought tooth and nail against a mining superprofits tax that would have ensured that some of the benefit of the commodity booms that they line their pockets with is returned to the people of Australia. Instead of their booming price just lining the pockets of Gina and Twiggy and Clive, it should enrich the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is no mining superprofits tax in this budget. There's no billionaires tax in this budget and neither is there any walking away from the stage 3 tax cuts that will further turn up the dial on economic inequality. These stage 3 tax cuts will deliver a $9,000 per annum tax cut to everyone who earns over $200,000 per annum at a cost—and have a go at this—of $150 billion over the next decade. These are more tax cuts for the billionaires. They've got to be repealed, they were grossly irresponsible at the time that they were introduced and they are even more grossly irresponsible now. What's more, the stage 3 tax cuts will immediately neutralise any of the progress that this budget makes towards putting women on a more equal economic footing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has clearly finally and belatedly been chastened by the backlash to its appalling handling of allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment in Parliament House and its repeated cuts to women's support services in previous budgets. But this so-called women's budget has barely moved the needle on economic security or personal safety for women. It comes after the government has cut funding for women's support services for most of the last seven years. As my colleague Senator Waters said, there's a lot of sizzle but not much substance. The women's budget statement details $3.4 billion in new spending over the forward estimates, which is welcomed by the Greens, including $1.9 billion to help support women's economic security. But in the first year of the stage 3 tax cuts men will receive in their pockets $5.5 billion more than women. They are gendered tax cuts. What's more, some of the measures in this so-called women's budget are actually likely to decrease economic security for a lot of women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposal to provide a government guarantee for single parents to buy a home with a two per cent deposit is directly encouraging single parents, many of whom are women, to take on a bigger loan than they would otherwise be able to do. It's nothing more than a government sanctioned debt trap. In the most overpriced housing market in the world, just how is encouraging people to borrow more money than they can afford and more money than everyone else going to help secure their future? Well, it's not. But that's how this budget approaches one of the fundamental causes of growing inequality. It continues to avoid the issue that is central to the housing affordability crisis, the homelessness crisis and the rent stress that many people are experiencing in this country. Australia's real estate is amongst the most expensive in the world, and what is the government's solution? To encourage people to take on even more debt, to raid their super, so they can spend even more money on housing and push housing prices up to even more ridiculous highs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who benefits from this? Existing investors, who only pay half the tax they should on the sale of their investment property, at a cost of $8.5 billion a year to the budget bottom line. Who else benefits from it? Yes, of course, the banks that are more than happy to write a loan of any size, regardless of whether people can afford it or not, and whose profits are heading right back up to where they were before the royal commission. They're rubbing their hands together at the thought of responsible lending laws being repealed. This madness has to stop. The Greens would get rid of the rorts in the tax system that has rigged the housing market in favour of investors and done over Australian people who simply want a home. We would invest massively in social and affordable housing, and build a million new affordable homes. We could end homelessness and provide people with an alternative to debt enslavement or a life in private rentals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's obsession with pumping the housing market ever higher is just one of the ways in which this budget once again does over young people. Having reaped the benefits of cheap housing, free university education, job security and a liveable climate, all members of this government can say to young people is: 'F you; we've got ours.' It's nothing less than a complete betrayal of an entire generation and of future generations. It will lock in inequality and actively make the climate breakdown quicker, because people in this parliament, with the possible exception of my colleague Senator Steele-John, won't be the ones who will bear the main brunt of the climate catastrophe. Those in the major parties of course, as they always do, will get their sinecures—their jobs on the boards of fossil fuel companies—and settle down to an extremely well superannuated retirement. And, in the meantime, the country and the society that young people will inherent is being run down by the day. To young people today, I can only and most sincerely apologise on behalf of my generation and those who came immediately before us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people, of course, will also bear the brunt of yet another round of cuts to higher education. The devastation caused by the pandemic and the loss of international students of itself is not enough for this government. The budget will reduce funding for universities by 10 per cent and reduce funding for TAFE by 24 per cent. My colleague Senator Faruqi said it well: 'How can we expect to rebuild when the government is hell-bent on decimating teaching and research?' And what's the government doing with the money it's cutting from universities and TAFE? It is putting more money into vocational education, most of which, of course, will go into the pockets of the for-profit providers—more cuts to public education, more money for privatisation, more outsourcing, more profits for the big corporates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stoking house prices and making cuts to tertiary education are just some of the ways this budget makes sure nothing is done to address entrenched poverty. This government's favourite way, of course, of entrenching poverty is to punish, threaten, bully and blame people who haven't got a job. Of course, why can't a lot of people get a job in this country? Because there aren't enough jobs to go around. Blaming an individual for the situation they're in is central to the great neoliberal con. It's also the go-to 'look over there' tactic to distract from the fact that the billionaires are making out like bandits. So, there again, in this budget is another $213 million to strengthen mutual obligations—more money spent forcing unemployed people to look for jobs that aren't there while income support payments stay bogged below the poverty line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not how things should be in a wealthy country like Australia, because we have a choice. Instead of giving the handouts to the big corporates and the billionaires, the Greens would increase JobSeeker to $80 a day and lift people who haven't got a job out of poverty. Together with investment in public services and public infrastructure, the Greens will provide a national jobs and income guarantee. We can afford to do this. We are a wealthy country. If we weren't continually giving the handouts to the big polluting corporations, to the already obscenely wealthy, we could achieve that goal. Ours is a commitment to real full employment and a universal liveable income to help increase wages and boost the economic recovery. It's the right and fair and humane thing to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To help meet this commitment to full employment, the Greens would establish a $6 billion nature fund. This colonial state has done a disgraceful job of looking after this beautiful country. Our rivers are drying, our forests are being strip-mined and burned, and thousands of species are facing extinction. First Nations people are losing totems, and cultural heritage is being wantonly destroyed for profit and for convenience. But we can turn around and create thousands of jobs in the restoration of nature, in reforestation and in the protection of our lands and our oceans. All it would take is a budget for nature. But that's not this budget. In this budget, nature loses again. Not content with having cut funding for environmental restoration since coming to power, this government has brought down a budget that includes more money to tear up environmental protections and destroy habitats. The government's own review into the EPBC Act found that a continuation of the existing regime would be an acceptance of habitat destruction and species extinction. If you take this budget as a measure of the government's mind, that's quite alright by them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much has been made of how well Australia has responded to the pandemic and how much that has helped economic conditions to recover. But let's remember this: the government outsourced quarantine to the states, they left aged care to rot, and now they've completely stuffed up the vaccine rollout. At every step, this government has hesitated and deflected. Scott Morrison is, in one regard, a lucky Prime Minister—that is, lucky to be the leader of an island nation. Sitting proudly in his office is a ghoulish trophy of a boat that celebrates his cruelty to people who sought asylum in Australia. Perhaps he might now commission a trophy of a plane to celebrate how he's prevented Australian citizens, permanent residents and temporary visa holders from coming home during this pandemic. His cruelty to refugees, people seeking asylum and migrants, which was his defining trait before becoming Prime Minister, has not stopped. In this budget, he is stripping back $671 million from migrants who need social support—an utterly unconscionable thing to do during a global pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, there's plenty of money to lock people up in offshore and onshore immigration detention. The government are going to spend nearly half a billion dollars of new money to warehouse yet more human beings indefinitely in immigration detention because the pandemic has resulted in a situation where they simply can't deport as many migrants as they would like to. And they're going to spend—get this figure!—$9,300 per person, per day on offshore detention. That is nearly $10,000 per person, per day on offshore detention to continue to brutalise people who have already suffered so greatly at this government's hands and at the hands of previous governments of both political stripes. It is nothing less than a stain on our national conscience, a foul and bloody chapter in our country's story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a budget built on marginalising people, destroying nature, turbocharging climate change and pandering to the billionaires and the big corporations. Just one example of that is its treatment of disabled people. This budget has cut staff to the NDIS while spending $127 million to pay for so-called independent assessments. What that will mean is strangers going into the homes of disabled people, forcing them to perform and prove that they actually have a disability. It is disgraceful and humiliating, and Senator Steele-John and the other Greens will fight that all the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude where I began: by acknowledging that we are on First Nations land. This land is stolen land, and what that means is that the wealth that this nation has accumulated and this budget allocates out is stolen wealth, wealth taken from this stolen land. Colonial Australia was founded on dispossessing First Nations peoples of their land. Whatever the dollar value of our wealth, we will remain poor as a nation until we are honest about that fact. We need truth-telling about the historical and ongoing injustices faced by First Nations people, truth-telling about the rapes, the kidnappings and the attempted genocide. We need justice for First Nations people. We need truth and we need a treaty between the sovereign First Peoples of this land and the colonising state. Until we have those things, every budget we see in this place will be parcelling out stolen wealth. In this budget we get a budget that damages country and further enriches the superwealthy with the profits of this stolen land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Budgets are about choices, and this budget chooses the billionaires over the millions of Australians who are struggling to get by. The government has made its choices in this budget and the Greens have made our choice, and we choose to take on and stand up to the billionaires. We choose to take on and stand up to the big corporates and their puppets in this place and in this parliament. We have a clear plan that would create a fairer and more equal society. We have a plan for justice for First Nations people, a plan for a government led program of action to set us up for the future and address the great challenges of our time, a plan to establish a national jobs and income guarantee and a 700 per cent renewable energy society by exporting clean energy to the world, a plan to build a million affordable, accessible and high-quality homes, a plan to revitalise Australia's manufacturing sector, including through locally made vaccines, a plan for universal free child care and free tertiary education, a plan to care for nature and restore degraded places. We have a plan for the billionaires and the big corporations to pay their fair share of tax so we can afford to deliver the public services and the supports that Australians want and need from their governments. Our commitment to the Australian people is to fight for them every day, instead of fighting for the vested interests that hold this country back, like the government is doing.</span>
