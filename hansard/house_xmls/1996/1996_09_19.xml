         Yesterday the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) as Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resource and Rural and Regional Affairs made a statement on this matter on behalf of the committee. The position as I understand it is that the committee is currently conducting an inquiry into Commonwealth fisheries management. Two persons who have lodged submissions with the committee have asked that leave be given for their submissions to be used in evidence in proceedings before the Federal Court.

He also might be willing to share with us his thoughts on the sittings of the House when President Clinton visits Australia. It is a matter that a number of members are interested in. Members want to know what they might be doing as regards their diaries and so on. Obviously the government will be looking at having some functions here in Canberra or replicating what the previous government did when President Bush visited Australia. Can the Leader of the House give us some idea on that as well as the other issue I raised?

        —in reply—I do not have any information at this stage as to the possibilities of the Clinton visit or a date, but as soon as I do have that information I will obviously make it available to members. As to the sitting schedule for the balance of the year, there is no intention at this point to depart from the schedule already provided to members. There is one week near the end of the sitting period in which the Senate will be sitting. I suppose there is always a prospect for us to also sit in that week. But at this point I am not able to say anything other than that we expect to sit in accordance with the already published schedule.

         —To date in this debate on the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill there has been a focus around the issues of health and of funding to the states. Today I want to take this matter further with respect to my own state of Tasmania and to draw out some of the consequences that will flow to that state from the decisions that have been made by the government and implemented through this legislation.

        To begin with, I suppose it is worth while referring to comments that were made by the Premier of my own state who believed that our community was improperly and unfairly dealt with by the federal government when it dealt with funding to the states. His comment was both powerful and condemnatory. He used language which would not normally be used in public discourse to describe what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) did to our state. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Costello's only been there a dog's watch, but he has been making Willis and Dawkins look good.
       </para>
       <para>
        When you think that has been the perpetual excuse, shall I say, of Liberal administrations in Tasmania—that their funding difficulties were caused by Commonwealth decisions under Labor governments—to find that expression used shows the magnitude of the concern that exists in my state.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was not just the Tasmanian Premier who was concerned about the way in which the states were being treated. As a result of the Premiers Conference which decided the
        <break page="4716" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         measures which are now coming before this House today, Premier Brown from South Australia said:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;state relations have never been as low as they are now.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both those comments are accurate. It is true to say that no federal government has treated the states in the last 20 years of federalism as this federal government has.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This federal government has betrayed the whole philosophical basis upon which it asserted its legitimacy to govern: first, by betraying its expressed promises to the community at large on a whole range of issues and, secondly, by betraying the commitment that it gave to the states—a commitment that it put very high to restore some integrity into federalism. Rather than increasing funding to the states to enable them to proceed in a way which was anticipated by those governments, the government reduced their funding base both in direct and indirect payments and thereby reduced programs which are directly relevant to people who expect services from state governments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will take my own state of Tasmania because it is going to be particularly savaged. Tasmania is unique in Australia because it has the highest population of people who are welfare dependent. This is nothing to be satisfied with; it is simply the truth. Tasmania has the highest proportion of health care card holders, it has the highest proportion of those dependent on government, and it has structurally some of the highest unemployment in the country—and has had for decades. A failure to provide arrangements which go to the employment base of our state and which rip apart the public sector does enormous damage to the prospects of Tasmania.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am increasingly despairing of any prospect for economic growth in my own state. Tasmania has a flat economy. It has structural problems of a dimension far greater than that which applies to the rest of the community. What did we find? We found that the impact of the regressive and unfair budget measures brought down by this government impact to a far greater degree on my own state of Tasmania than they do on other parts of Australia.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Direct cuts that flow from the budget now total over $48 million. When we are used to talking about billions of dollars, a sum of $48 million might be easily dismissed. But when you come from a state like Tasmania, where you know that the revenue base available to the state government is minuscule compared with the revenue bases that are available to state governments in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, you know it is not practicable to substitute, by increased state revenues, those funds that have been withdrawn from the Commonwealth.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Tasmania already has some of the highest state charges and taxes throughout the Commonwealth. It has those highest charges because revenue has to be raised from such a small base. There is no practical way of reducing those charges, nor indeed is there a practical way of increasing them because, if one were to increase them in order to substitute for some of the Commonwealth funding deficiencies, the existing disadvantages that our state faces in attracting investment become greater.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With mobile capital and mobile investment, a state which is dramatically out of the norm of all other Australian states would not be capable of attracting investment or retaining the small amount of investment that it already holds. So our state government is trapped in a position where it cannot raise its revenue to substitute for the expenditure reductions that are being imposed by the Commonwealth. Nor is there a private sector ready to take off in my state of Tasmania.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The programs that were behind the growth in some key sectors of the Tasmanian economy are being stripped away. One of the few bright lights that exist in Tasmania in terms of potential growth is the shipbuilding industry, building catamarans. There are only a few bright spots in Tasmania and that is one of the brightest. The budget measure that most savagely impacts on Tasmania in terms of private sector growth is that which relates to the bounty scheme, which is being withdrawn. We have the huge irony that this government is prepared to review its own budget decisions to make sure that companies such as BHP can import vessels from overseas shipbuilders,
         <break page="4717" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          subsidising them to do so, at the same time withdrawing bounties which enable boats to be built in this country and enable our manufacturers to compete on roughly equivalent terms with the subsidised shipbuilders of other nations.

         When the Managing Director of Incat, Bob Clifford, has the temerity to draw attention to those consequences and to the deficiencies of the new training arrangements, his concerns are dismissed by the new government. Unless the new training arrangements are reviewed—he employs more than 100 people—he will miss out on opportunities to bring down the benefits that are alleged to flow from the new apprenticeship arrangements and he will not be able to access the Working Nation programs any more because they are being withdrawn.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I understand that there is some prospect that these matters may be looked at again. I know that when the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, went to Incat he promised that these matters would be reviewed. We are still waiting for that and we want that to happen, but the track record to date looks pretty poor.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have a state which does not have the capacity to raise its own revenues, a state where private sector investment is, to say the best, sluggish, with a state Liberal government that has no investment or private sector growth strategy—certainly none that has had any discernible effect—and a state where the few areas of economic stimulation that have come in are being withdrawn. Where are they being withdrawn from? Not only from direct funding to the states but also through programs—for example, the better cities program, which has been used to develop new growth areas in Launceston.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Inveresk rail project has drawn together state, Commonwealth and local governments and the University of Tasmania, but future funding will not occur. The better cities program was actually delivering benefits in a real sense to Tasmania in terms of jobs and helping to shape the possibility of some resurgence of growth in the economy that is now not available. So, too, the Working Nation program. For many parts of Australia,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the Working Nation program was important because it meant that people who had been out of the work force for a long time had some chance to get back in, and it gave them, notwithstanding the fact that the ordinary operations of the labour market would have otherwise left them outside, the opportunity for re&amp;hyphen;employment.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But in Tasmania it meant much more than that. Because the Labor government saw it as important to address the resources of the Working Nation program to areas which had the greatest employment needs, Tasmania naturally benefited more per capita than any other state—because we had the greatest long&amp;hyphen;term unemployment. So Working Nation was not only important in getting Tasmanians some work experience and some chance to gain labour market skills which they would not otherwise have had; it actually supported public sector investment which would not otherwise have occurred. Most particularly in that regard I refer to the Aquatic Centre, a large complex developed by the Hobart City Council where the actual cash value input of the Working Nation program was specifically structured and supported at levels which were arrived at in order to make sure that project could proceed and meant the difference between a major multi&amp;hyphen;million dollar project going ahead or not going ahead.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the same way, Working Nation programs were important to the state tourism industry because of the support they provided to the state government through the National Parks and Wildlife Service. So a whole amount of infrastructure that was important for walking tracks and wilderness protection came through the Working Nation programs. That will all go.

         Our hospitals are going to be devastated. The way in which public sector funds for health have been dealt with—about $780 million effectively slashed from the budget—will mean that an already fragile and poorly performing health system will have to sack literally hundreds of staff. There are no other jobs for them to go to. The Tasmanian economy has no slack to be picked up. These people will simply be discarded. This is an extraordinary recipe to respond to concerns
         <break page="4718" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         What other funds have been withdrawn? The amount of $16 million will be forgone in general revenue grants in order to allegedly help out with the federal budget deficit—a completely pointless, stupid, unnecessary move. This will be done in order, and only in order, to give some cover to this government that is really seeking to bring back malign policies that would not have otherwise had the endorsement of the population. It is extraordinary when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in his more honest moments, described the economy that he inherited as better than good, yet we then find this government in office in its first budget taking these measures—measures which are quite unnecessary.

         We have the third best balance of payments, terms of trade deficit, in the OECD—outcomes that other governments would give their eye teeth for. What do we find? We find this government pretending that Australia has a crisis on its hands.

         You can do your own sums but at the very least $48 million on a recurrent basis means substantially more than 2,000 jobs lost to the Tasmanian economy directly. Then there are the indirect consequences. In a flat, low employment economy, with no growth and no opportunities, if 2,000 jobs go the multiplier effect applies. You would expect the consequence in Tasmania to be in the order of 6,000 to 8,000 jobs lost in addition to the high levels of existing unemployment directly as a consequence of those cuts.

A number of the general service programs were producing results in the order of 50 per cent; some were lower.

         —If there was any doubt about the philosophical and directional differences between a Labor government and a coalition government, then perhaps they are best borne out by the contribution of the Commonwealth to the states over a period of time. That contribution to the states basically takes two forms. The first form, of course, is general purpose grants and the second form is specific purpose payments.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill provides for $16.3 billion in general purpose assistance to the states in 1996-97. Of that $16.3 billion, $15.346 billion is in the form of what is known as financial assistance grants. The rest of the money is made up of some adjustments. The most significant adjustment, of course, is the $615 million contribution from the states to the federal government's budgetary problems. Those problems, variously known as Beazley's black hole and Labor's legacy, are something that the states—I welcome the states' contribution here—must contribute to because they are beneficiaries of a strong and vibrant economy. They are the beneficiaries of responsible fiscal management at the Commonwealth level. That flows through to the states in the form of increased revenue for them through payroll tax, stamp duty and various other taxes, fees and fines, and the increased growth in the overall economy contributes to their own increase in their own purpose funding.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is a variation that I would like to talk about today; that is, the role of specific purpose payments. This is where the most significant difference between the Labor Party and the coalition parties in government comes to the fore. In the 1996-97 budget, the Commonwealth is allocating $18,170 million in specific purpose payments to the states. Of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         that sum, $11,135 million is in direct specific purpose payments to the states and $7,035 million travels through the states to specific purposes. Therefore, the total allocation to the states in 1996-97 is $33,516 million. Of that allocation, 46 per cent is in the form of general purpose assistance and 54 per cent is in the form of specific purpose payments. The overwhelming majority of the payments to the states is in the form of specific purpose payments. This is not necessarily unusual. It is a legacy we have been left with and it is a reflection of the centralism of the ALP when they have been in government.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Specific purpose payments started in 1923. They were used at that time for various purposes when the nation as a whole had a very basic private sector and the government had to take responsibility for developing new industries in our economy. Over the years there have been changes, of course. During the Menzies years it was important, in order to stimulate the development of higher education, that very specific purpose payments were made through the states to the universities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However in 1972, when Gough Whitlam became Prime Minister, the SPP allocation to the states quadrupled in aggregate dollars. It went from 25.8 per cent of the total allocation to the states to 48.5 per cent. That is a very important point. All of a sudden, the Labor government comes in and they start winding up the specific purpose payments and tying the hands of the states and their ability to provide services to those most in need where the demand is.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Gough Whitlam was the great turning point in the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states in relation to specific purpose payments. It was not just the allocations to universities through his introduction of free education. It was the Whitlam government's commitment to extend the interference of the Commonwealth into the areas of preschools, child care, urban and regional development, hospitals and community health, and local government. The hands of the Commonwealth were extended into the areas that until that time were the direct responsibility of the states. Until that time, the public had a very clear understanding of the
        <break page="4720" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         difference in the roles and responsibilities of the Commonwealth government versus the state governments.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1975-76, as I said before, specific purpose payments represented 48.5 per cent of all the allocations to the states. In 1975-76, with the change of government, it took some time to change that relationship. The Fraser government was responsible about trying to free up the money that was allocated to the states. The Fraser government took the SPP ratio down from 48.5 per cent to 36 per cent in 1982-83. That included at the time an increase in the allocation to local government from $80 million to $425 million per annum.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There was a clear difference between the attitude of the Labor Party in government and that of the Liberal Party in government. In March 1983, as we all know, Bob Hawke came to power and again the relationship changed to the interfering Commonwealth government. Over the 13 years of Labor government, Bob Hawke, along with Paul Keating, who was an avowed centralist, took the ratio from 36 per cent to 53 per cent in 1995-96.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The relationship again changed between the Commonwealth and the states. It is interesting that during the debate on this bill we have had members of the Labor Party stand up and actually advocate the increased spending of the Commonwealth in areas that are the responsibility of the states. I recommend to the members of the Labor Party that they re-read section 51 of the constitution. I recommend to the members of the Labor Party that they look at the minutes of the initial meetings that set up the Commonwealth and the expected relationship as it has developed over time between the Commonwealth and the states. The more you tie the hands of the states in relation to specific purpose payments, the more you are affecting the delivery of services to the people most in need.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do give credit where it is due. Credit is due to the attempts of Bob Hawke and Nick Greiner in 1990-91 to more clearly define the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. In the Special Premiers Conference of July 1991 a number of goals were set and options were considered in relation to the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         management of tied grants. Even by that stage Bob Hawke recognised that the level of specific purpose payments to the states had got out of control.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would just like to repeat those options for the benefit of the House. They included, firstly, an assumption of responsibility for programs by the states with full absorption of tied grants into financial assistance grants; secondly, the broadbanding of grants by combining a number of specific payments; thirdly, lessening the conditions applying to the existing structure of payments; fourthly, the assumption by the Commonwealth of full financial and administrative responsibility for programs currently receiving tied grants; and, finally, where shared responsibility options are developed, alternative approaches such as better joint planning or consultation might prove to be a substitute for tied Commonwealth funding. There is a clear recognition out of those options by the Commonwealth under Bob Hawke that specific purpose payments were disadvantageous to the states and to the people who most needed the support.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1995-96, of the $33,703 million allocated in total assistance to the states, only $14,453 million was in financial assistance grants. The reason the recommendations of the Special Premiers Conference fell on the floor was that at the same time as Paul Keating knifed Bob Hawke he knifed the new developing relationship between the states and the  Commonwealth. That was basically the end of any attempt to clearly define for the people of Australia the difference in roles and responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the states.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At times, however, governments had untied funding. Two of the most celebrated instances are, firstly, health in 1981-82 where the Commonwealth agreed that hospitals and community health funding should be untied and, secondly, in 1992 where Prime Minister Keating agreed that road funding should be untied. Even then, when the road funding was untied, it was still tagged as road funding. Therefore, there was a direct pressure on the states to say, `This has to go into roads,' instead of giving them the discretionary
        <break page="4721" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         power to perhaps put it into transport in some states.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no doubt that Queensland, Western Australia and a few of the other larger states deserve to have better road funding and deserve to have better roads. But in New South Wales there is a strong argument that instead of putting more and more money into roads, which the state government already does by its 3x3 road levy, the money should be going into better transport solutions, particularly in parts of western Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The argument is that under the opposition Commonwealth-State relations have unquestionably become more confused and more interfering. I am not saying that specific purpose payments are an ineffective way of improving a certain segment of the community. Specific purpose payments do have their role, and I accept that. But there are some legitimate areas, for example, where the Commonwealth purchases off the state various service deliveries. For example, in Aboriginal affairs it is easier for some of the state authorities to deliver services to various Aboriginal communities rather than the Commonwealth setting up a new service delivery system which duplicates some of the processes provided by the states.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, there are operational efficiencies if one state undertakes a project which benefits another. For example, if a highway is going to be built through New South Wales or there is an upgrade of the Pacific Highway, it is important that the benefit flows through to Queensland because they have a benefit in a better and safer main highway through to Sydney. That is an area where the Commonwealth has a legitimate responsibility to ensure that SPPs are used. The third area is to deliver national objectives. For example, SPPs were used to deliver the standardisation of railway gauges across Australia. In 1988, SPPs were used to deliver bicentennial celebrations right across the nation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are legitimate purposes for SPPs, but there are also downsides. The main area of downside is the duplication of services. Jeff Kennett said it very succinctly before the Premiers Conference in 1994. He said, `You have a Commonwealth department of health
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         that does not treat one patient and you have a Commonwealth department of education that does not teach one pupil.' That is a fair point. It is a generalisation, but it is a fair point because the Commonwealth has no responsibility for teaching children in schools. Therefore, why should the Commonwealth be funding schools, whether they be private schools or public schools?
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of this year's major SPPs, which I think was just over $1 billion, was in funding for private schools. I am not saying for a second that the private schools do not deserve or do not need that funding but, given, for example, that the New South Wales Department of Education funds $6 billion of the recurrent costs in school education, why is the Commonwealth duplicating that overall service?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second area of concern relates to duplication and various groups playing off the Commonwealth and the states for funding. I do not think there is any doubt on both sides of this House that, when it comes to election time, people and various groups in our communities who have asked their state or local governments for funding and have received the big no turn to the Commonwealth government and ask them whether they can fund the local swimming pool, park or sporting facilities. At the end of the day, it all comes out of one pocket, and that is the taxpayers' pocket. Because it comes out of one pocket, we ought to ensure that only one hand is giving out the money. In certain circumstances, that hand should be the state; in certain circumstances, that hand should be the Commonwealth; and, in certain circumstances, that hand should be local government. But it is all taxpayers' money.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is duplication. Various interest groups, no matter how poorly organised, always manage to play off one tier of government against another. A good example of this is in legal aid, where currently there is a dispute about whether the Commonwealth is decreasing funding for legal aid. The states also provide significant funding for legal aid. In 1996-97 the Commonwealth provided $150 million to legal aid around Australia.
       </para>
       <break page="4722" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The third downside of SPPs is that, because they are coming from the Commonwealth, money and support do not necessarily get to the people most in need. For example, during the severe drought in New South Wales and Queensland, the rural adjustment scheme simply tied farmers in red tape. The Commonwealth from Canberra was trying to decide at what point on the map people were in need of money and were not in need of money. There was a gross duplication of services. Agriculture departments in New South Wales and Queensland were constantly in battle to try to get the money there.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The most significant area where that downside occurs is in community services, particularly in disability services where $300 million is being allocated this year, and in home and community care where $305 million has been allocated by the Commonwealth. Those services are also provided by the states. In some cases, the states are delivering the services but the federal government is stepping in.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A fourth downside is that Canberra keeps telling the states how to spend their money. Having been involved at the state level, I can say that this is the most damaging aspect of specific purpose payments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A classic example is where a certain program, perhaps in community services, has a 60 per cent success rate and the Commonwealth—or the state might argue—comes along for political purposes and says, `We will offer you 50c in the dollar if you go ahead with this terrific program.' The states have a 60 per cent success rate and it costs them only 50c in the dollar, so they say, `We are tight for money; we will go ahead with this program.' But they have an alternative program which has a 90 per cent success rate, and they have to pay 100c in the dollar, and they abandon that program.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So from Canberra we are telling the governments of Perth, Brisbane, Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney how to deliver the services that best suit the needs of their local communities. Importantly, this lowers the discretionary funding for the states.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The final, most important area is accountability. Haven't we seen some great flick
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          passes over the years between the Commonwealth and the states about exactly who is responsible for higher education or who is responsible for community services? Forty&amp;hyphen;five per cent of all the funding to the states comes from the Commonwealth. This vertical fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states, this imbalance about a state's ability to raise its own funding and then spend its own money on its own services, is creating ongoing hardship to the people most in need—the community out there whom we represent.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Specific purpose payments need to be pared back. This government, I am sure, will pare them back because it is a tradition of the Liberal government that we give the states the opportunity to do what they can do best, and that is delivering services to those in need.

         —Following from the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), you can certainly claim that this government is definitely paring back specific purpose payments, and in some ways that is in accordance with the recommendations in the report of the National Commission of Audit. It suggested that you get more efficient national and state financial administration for the country if you redirect all the money that is now provided in specific purpose payments for health and community services and subtract 10 per cent for the federal Treasury, providing only 90 per cent of the funding that is now available to the states. Of course, that would result in a reduction of the quality of service to patients and the broader community. That is obviously what this government has in mind.

Surely that is going to increase the vertical fiscal imbalance and make all those problems that you claim are caused by the imbalance even worse. For those reasons, I was not persuaded by the

In addition, in the budget papers the government is saying that, because of cost shifting from the states to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth is going to clearly take back a further $313 million from federal funding for state public hospitals over the next four years.

         . As a result of the Howard government's decisions, there are reductions to public hospital federal funding, and it is probably also in the electorate of the member for Longman. So $450 million has been lost to public hospitals as a result of the reductions in the financial assistance grants and the $313 million reduction is allegedly because of cost shifting.

         Let us have a look at this argument of cost shifting. It is true that, as state governments have put pressure on local hospitals and on area health services, there has been cost shifting. In many cases, public hospitals have had to cost shift just to keep beds open in all states. Despite the fact that day after day in our newspapers, on radio and on television we are seeing the consequences of the pressures on public hospitals, you are saying there is too much money in our public hospitals. You are saying that you are going to use this excuse of cost shifting to further reduce federal funding for public hospitals by $313 million in this budget alone. That reduction will only make the problems worse. Whether or not there has been cost shifting, if you reduce the federal funding for public hospitals, that will only make the problems worse.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This reduction of a total of $800 million over the next four years is equivalent to the government's cutting back 1,000 beds across the country. It is equivalent to the government's stopping 66,000 operations across the country. It is no wonder that the waiting lists will get longer and the waiting times for casualty and emergency will be longer. Ultimately, people's lives are placed at risk if we cannot expect to get a reasonable standard of care and treatment in our public hospitals.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         During the last four years of the Labor government in particular, under various health ministers the federal funding for state public hospitals actually increased. But, unfortunately, as the federal funding went up under Labor, I regret to say that state conservative governments were cutting back their funding for public hospitals. The worst offender was Victoria where we had federal Labor increase the funding by $200 million and Mr Kennett, the Premier of Victoria, cut back the state funding for public hospitals by even more—by $275 million.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is the real reason that we have people like the Director of Emergency Services at St Vincents in Melbourne saying that people, after going to a casualty ward, are getting inhuman treatment by being forced to wait for more than three days before even getting admitted to a bed at St Vincents. This is the
         <break page="4725" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          direct result of Liberal state governments cutting back their state effort.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Deputy Speaker, I will just quote you the figures as I know that you are very interested in these statistics. Mr Kennett, as I mentioned, reduced his funding by more than $260 million to $270 million. Even the Premier of South Australia, Dean Brown, cut back that state's funding for public hospitals by $66 million. In Western Australia, Richard Court reduced their government's funding for public hospitals by $160 million.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In contrast, in New South Wales, despite the fact—as I accept—they do not have a perfect system, they increased the funding by $600 million over the last two years. If every state government put in as much effort and funding, extra effort and extra funding as New South Wales has in the last two years, we should be seeing an improvement in the quality of public hospitals across the country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Whatever effort the states make—we do not control state governments; we are here to decide what the Commonwealth government does—my concern today is that, while federal Labor was increasing federal funding for public hospitals, you have headed in the opposite direction. You are cutting back in this budget federal funding for state public hospitals by $800 million. That means that people will suffer and are at risk of dying because there will not be the beds, there will not be the qualified staff, there will not be the effort in public hospitals right across the country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         People opposite may say, `Well, it's due to the economic pressures, due to the fact that we want to get the budget into surplus; we cannot afford to do what people such as the Labor Party are saying.' Let us just test that argument.

         The government in this budget is providing $1.7 billion in a new tax break for private health insurance. Despite the fact that it is a shambles—we have had the health funds increase their premiums so that almost all of the tax rebate has gone—the government says that they can afford $1.7 billion in this tax break for private health insurance.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          You really have to ask whether providing a tax break for the industry was the right way to address the problem. Rather than giving $1.7 billion to private health insurance, perhaps the government should have considered whether it would have been better to give that $1.7 billion directly to public hospitals across the country. Perhaps that was the best way to address the most serious problems in our health system. I certainly believe that it is too late to try to stop the $1.7 billion tax break, because that would only penalise the patients and contributors.

          The point I make is that people should really be asking whether, in spending 13 years in opposition drafting their health policy, those opposite should have given some thought to whether the money would have been better spent by directly improving federal funding for public hospitals. Those opposite said that this tax break would make a fundamental difference. But, if it is just a tax break for the private health insurance industry, perhaps we should have directed that money directly at public hospitals.

          Then there is the second argument, `Well, we have to get the budget into surplus.' This is an argument that has been pursued very severely by the Victorian state government. A week or two ago that government brought down its state budget and claimed that it had a terrific set of figures, that the budget is going back into surplus. Yet almost in the same week—as I am sure the people in the gallery will remember—there were stories on the front page of the Melbourne

           I think the day is coming when people will ask: what is more important—the size of the surplus or the quality of our public hospitals? Is it a good reflection on the government of Victoria that they might have the best state surplus of any of the states of the Common wealth, but they will end up with the reputation of having the worst quality of care in public hospitals? My view is that it is time we looked at the level of federal and state funding for public hospitals right across the country.

          I would like to finish by making the point that this whole debate about the level of federal funding for public hospitals will be something that we will continue to bring up in the public debate. We had the minister for health in question time yesterday alleging that New South Wales was the `worst offender'—and they were his words—in cost shifting for the Commonwealth. The member for North Sydney nods his head in agreement, not realising that what that means is that the minister for health has got New South Wales public hospitals in the target sights. The minister for health, in saying that he believes New South Wales is the worst offender, is giving a clear signal to every public hospital in New South Wales that federal funding will be reduced even further.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As this government thinks that New South Wales is the `worst offender', I would challenge it to go out to Nepean Hospital, Mount Druid Hospital or Westmead Hospital and tell the staff, the patients and the people who live in western Sydney that their public hospitals have too much money. What is really happening is that this government is seeking to penalise public hospitals in New South Wales because New South Wales has the hide to elect a Labor government. That is what they are doing.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Yesterday's statement by the minister for health that he will be targeting New South Wales, penalising New South Wales, is something that I think should send a very clear warning bell to patients and the staff at public hospitals right across New South Wales. For all these reasons, we have real concerns about what this government has done and we will be pursuing these issues for many days to come.

          I want to make a few comments about Tasmania because the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) raised some things about my own state in regard to the Tasmanian package. He said, in regard to passenger equalisation—a very good initiative by this government in regard to Tasmania—that we promised that we would provide $49 million and that has been reduced in this budget. Well, that is not true. The reality is that, depending on the number of passengers who go across Bass Strait, they will be funded under this equalisation scheme. It might even go above $49 million. Who knows? It depends on the amount of traffic going across the strait.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          He also claimed that freight equalisation had been cut. The premise of that comment is: if there is no freight going across, you still have to pay freight equalisation. What a ludicrous suggestion by the member for Denison. The fact is: if freight is going across the strait and it is eligible for the equalisation, it will be paid.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another comment he made was about the wheat equalisation scheme. He said that this is going to raise the price of bread. There have been estimates by a range of people saying how much per tonne it might cause the price of wheat going into my state to rise. On the upper end of the scale, they are saying $14 a tonne and on the lower end of the scale it is about $6 to $7 a tonne.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Even if it were the higher end of the scale, that would mean a 1.4c increase per kilogram. I am not sure whether that is really of great significance to the overwhelming majority of people. When you calculate it out and think about it, it is a very small change. The fluctuations in the price of wheat is $70 to $80 a
          <break page="4728" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           tonne, so any change in this area is going to be quite small.

         <para first-indent="16">
          He also claimed that the direct reduction in jobs in Tasmania would be around about 1,000 people with an indirect reduction of maybe 6,000 to 8,000. Tasmania has an economy that is quite strong. This government has taken measures which will certainly help underpin that economy.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the measures that is very important is the decision about forestry. Under the previous Labor government, forestry had no security and no stability right throughout Australia and Tasmania where it is a major part of the economy. This government has now moved to ensure that there is security and stability in that very important industry to our state.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Not only that, in regard to the passenger equalisation scheme, you will find that, with more people travelling across Bass Strait, that will be beneficial to the state. There are a lot of people in Tasmania, Victoria and other states who have found this measure, which was adopted by this government, to be very beneficial. I am sure that that will be beneficial to the Tasmanian economy.

          There are a few general points which have been made, and I would like to comment on the fiscal contribution by the states. In regard to the fiscal contribution by the states, the opposition would like to say, `Well, this decision of the states having to agree to a certain amount of money is outrageous.' But in actual fact it was an agreement worked out between the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) of the Commonwealth and the state Premiers.

         —The Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill represents in a sense, I suppose, the jewel in the coalition's crown, the centrepiece of the election campaign, the famous family tax initiative. Unfortunately for Australian families, however, this initiative is being delivered as part of the most family unfriendly budget that has been seen in this parliament for at least 15 years. I say that because, as we on this side of the House know, and as the Australian community is becoming increasingly aware, this budget takes from families in a whole variety of ways a lot more than it gives to them through this initiative.

         which so much attention was given during the election campaign, he and his Treasurer (Mr Costello) are busily engaged in taking out of the other pocket of just about every family in this country as a consequence of the combination of the changes to, in particular, child care, pharmaceutical benefit charges, higher education charges and the reduction in a number of ways of support for the elderly, which is an increasing responsibility of so many families in our country.

        The family tax initiative puts into people's pockets $3.85 a week for each dependent child, with an extra $9.60 a week being available if the family has a child under five, with couples only being eligible for this additional payment, however, if the second partner earns no more than $4,500 a year. The family tax payments are means tested. Families only receive the basic payment if their taxable income is less than $70,000, plus $3,000 for each child after the first.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important to appreciate that the extra payment for children under five is only paid if the main breadwinner's income is less than $65,000 together with the $3,000 for each child after the first child. I make the point about those various constraints and limitations because I do not think it is widely understood that only a relatively limited number of families in this country will benefit from the second part of the initiative, that is, the availability of the extra $9.60 a week for a child under five where one of the partners is only earning a minimal income. Only 13 per cent at most of Australian families will benefit from that part of the proposal. In order to demonstrate that, I seek leave to incorporate in

            —A small further point to make by way of introduction, I suppose, is that instead of providing a rebate for this amount the legislation takes the rather unusual step for those families who are paying tax of adjusting the income tax-free threshold by $1,000 for each dependent child under the first part of the concession and by $2,500 if the family has a child under five years old. This has the same effect as providing a rebate. For some reason the government has taken the unusual step of putting it up as a tax free threshold change. I presume that is to reduce the comparison with the much more generous family taxation rebates which applied under Labor, such as the spouse rebate, the sole parent rebate, the housekeeper rebate and the child component of the zone rebate, just for a start.

           All that being said about the nature of the proposal now before us, I think it is also important to appreciate in understanding its significance that the form in which it comes before us very much represents a retreat by the government on the proposal as it was originally crafted and publicised. The Treasurer's second reading speech alludes to the fact that the coalition took a family tax package to the election. It certainly did, but it is not the package that is before this parliament.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The proposal that was announced during the election campaign was different from that before us in a very significant respect, one that made it a very fundamentally flawed proposal. The way in which it was unfair was the spousal income test that was contained in the proposal previously publicised. A family was to be excluded from any benefit at all in relation to the second part of the payment if the non-breadwinning spouse earned any income at all from part-time work.

           You could have a process worker husband and a wife doing maybe no more than two hours on a Friday night in a supermarket checkout earning just a few hundred or a few thousand dollars in the course of the year, but that would be enough to exclude that family completely from the eligibility that it would otherwise have had for the payment. At the same time, if the income received by the non-

            breadwinner was in the form of unearned income, income from investments and the like and not actual labour, then you could earn up to $20,700 by that means and still qualify for the additional payment. It was an outrageous proposal. It was exposed by Labor as a rort. It would have meant, for example, that families with around $300,000 in net investable assets would have been able to qualify for the concession even though much poorer families with the breadwinner just working a few hours a week part-time would have been excluded.

          <para first-indent="16">
           I am pleased to be able to say that, due to the pressure that has been applied by us on this issue, the government has relented and has introduced as the appropriate income test for the non-breadwinner spouse the level that is applicable for the parenting allowance. That is a much fairer test as it only allows $4,500 in income to be earned but, more importantly, because it makes no distinction at all between the type of income that is earned, it does not discriminate in the way that was the case previously against low income families where both parents have to work. It does not unfairly favour high wealth families where one partner is earning a substantial income from investments.

          <para first-indent="16">
           I make it clear that, had the proposal come before the parliament in the form in which it was publicised during the election campaign, we would certainly have sought to amend it to reflect what is now in fact contained in this particular bill. I do acknowledge the fact that the government has made the amendment. The fact that they have done so and incorporated it in the bill now before us means that the opposition can support the measure, and I indicate that we will do so.

           The measure, however, is not going to get off scot-free in terms of criticism by us, the main point of that criticism being, as I intimated at the outset, that it is given on the one hand but in many ways taken away again by a variety of other measures that are contained in this particular budget.

          <para first-indent="16">
           The budget itself, it should be said at the outset, is one that has many flaws. This is not the occasion to spell them all out in detail. I just simply say again for the record that the
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            basic flaws are these: first of all, the whole strategy underlying the budget of a massive contractionary impact on the economy, focusing all the emphasis on deficit reduction and giving no priority at all to growth in employment—in fact, putting together a series of slashes and burns and cuts and draconian revenue measures which will take about half a per cent of growth out of the economy—is exactly the wrong strategy to be applying overall in the context of the economic problems of this country as they now exist.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The only real substantial economic problem Australia has at the moment is the problem of unemployment—utterly unacceptable at 8&amp;half; per cent, or more than that now, and not only a tremendous need for the economy to grow fast enough to be able to jog along at the existing unacceptable rate but also a desperate need to bring that rate down. The whole philosophy of the budget in not putting growth in employment first is fundamentally flawed. It is justified by reference to talk of a fiscal crisis in Australia, the need to engage in these hairshirt measures and the need to inflict this pain because of some greater good for the economy as a whole. All of this serves to make people feel virtuous, I suppose, when they are bearing pain, but it is utterly unnecessary pain.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There are many ways of making that point. I do so on this occasion quickly and simply by saying that the best way of understanding Australia's situation and understanding that we are not in crisis is to compare our situation so far as debt and deficit are concerned with that which prevails internationally. The truth of the matter is that we have the third lowest budget deficit in the industrialised world. We have the fourth lowest government debt of all those countries in the industrialised world. We amply satisfy the tests of good economic management that have been identified by the European Union as the criteria for joining that particular monetary union being proposed in that part of the world. By any standard the Australian economy is fundamentally in sound shape so far as those issues are concerned. There is no justification for the assault that is being launched upon the economy and, in particular, the lack of hope that
           <break page="4733" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            is involved for the jobless as a result of the whole budget strategy.

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Beyond that there are many other things that can be said about this budget. The promise breaking that is involved in it and the deception of the Australian community is really quite breathtaking: something over 25 major deliberately given promises explicitly broken and scores of lesser ones. We have estimated over $17 billion worth of broken promises in this budget. For every dollar's worth of promises that have been kept in the budget there is $2.25 worth of promises that have been broken. The gloss on Honest John Howard, I think, has well and truly worn off as a result of this little excursion, and that is a point that we will be making many times in the future.

            —Honest John has become Jobless Johnny, as I am appropriately reminded by the shadow minister for trade. The third basic flaw in this budget—and one that we will be pointing to on every occasion that we rise to speak about it—is the assault that it makes on the unemployed and the assault that it makes on pensioners and so many other categories of disadvantaged Australians. It is an assault which is made even more cruel, even more disgraceful, when one takes into account that it is all so desperately unnecessary. As the product of an ideological passion for small government, it is not a product of economic management necessity.

           We will be making the point—this bill is a very appropriate context in which to make it—that this budget involves a quite fundamental deception of middle Australia. It is not only wrong&amp;hyphen;headed in its economic strategy, it is not only full of promise breaking and deception to Australians at large and it is not only full of unnecessary pain and assaults on the disadvantaged; it involves a very fundamental deception of middle Australia, mainstream Australia—the people for whom this budget was meant to be crafted, the audience to whom this budget was primarily directed. The nature of that deception of middle Australia becomes clear, I think, when you start looking systematically—layer by layer, item

            by item, issue by issue—at all the other measures in this budget that hack away at the income of mainstream Australian families.

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           One element, of course, of the deception of middle Australia that is involved in this budget that has become a matter of absolute notoriety in the last two or three weeks is the treatment of the private health insurance incentives. We have already seen the reality becoming starkly clear when, whatever prima facie return there might have been for families in this particular measure, it is being immediately eroded by the behaviour of the health funds in increasing their fees and doing so in a way which has made the government look both clumsy and incompetent, and impotent as well, in a way which has opened up a dramatic gap between the Prime Minister and his own Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), which has shown a mutual lack of confidence between the two of them starkly exposed on the floor of this House, but in a way which, most importantly of all, has created a situation where any conceivable benefit for Australian families in these particular incentives, in these rebates, is totally eroded. Some families in New South Wales, for example, face increases of $306 a year in their private health fund contributions, and that will totally wipe out the $250 rebate for couples and erode by two&amp;hyphen;thirds the $450 rebate for families with dependent children.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Apart from that deception, there are other deceptions throughout the whole budget structure. One of them, on which the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) will very appropriately spend some time, is the deception that is involved in not bringing to the attention of mainstream Australian families the way in which the operation of the tax system will erode a significant proportion of the benefits that are flowing to families through the phenomenon of fiscal drag. That is to say, as family incomes slowly rise—and they are rising more slowly than they used to because inflation is very much lower—people move into higher tax brackets, a greater amount of tax is drawn from them and they have less disposable income, obviously, as a result. When you do the arithmetic of how that phenomenon is likely to work itself out over
           <break page="4734" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            the next three years, you can see a very dramatic erosion of a number of the purported benefits that are contained in this particular family tax initiative.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The biggest deception of all is the one that is involved in pretending to middle Australia, families with children, that they are going to be substantially better off as a result of this family tax package. When you take into account all the other measures that are impacting on families in this particular budget, the impossibility of sustaining that argument and the fraudulent character of that argument become starkly apparent. Let me spend just a few moments going through the main categories of impact on families that are contained in the other parts of the budget. For a start, take child care. Maximum child&amp;hyphen;care assistance is going to be frozen for the next two years but fees, of course, will continue to increase and the value of that assistance will erode as a result. The child&amp;hyphen;care assistance ceiling will be capped and the $30 income disregard for each dependent child will also be abolished, reducing thereby child&amp;hyphen;care assistance payments.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Most families with children in formal care will certainly lose more from these changes in child&amp;hyphen;care assistance than they gain from the family tax initiative. A family with two children in long day care for 50 hours a week, on an annual income of just under $30,000, will pay $19.60 extra per week. The same family earning $45,500 per year will pay $15.30 extra per week in child&amp;hyphen;care fees. In addition to that basic problem with the child&amp;hyphen;care increases, you have families with children in community based, long day care centres having to pay substantially higher fees following the abolition of the operating subsidy. EPAC has estimated that that operating subsidy is worth $21.40 per week for children under three. For children older than three, it is $14.35 per week. There is every reason to believe that fees in the community child&amp;hyphen;care centres will rise by just that amount, dramatically and instantaneously eroding as a result any value that might be thought to flow from the family tax initiative.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Then, of course, you have the increases in the pharmaceutical benefit charges. The

            Howard&amp;hyphen;Costello government has increased the price of pharmaceuticals covered by the PBS system by up to 20 per cent. Most of the drugs that doctors prescribe are covered by the PBS. The situation now exists where the charge that many families will have to contemplate for particular drugs goes up an extra $2.60, to $20. You can be forced to pay out. As everyone knows, kids tend to get sick at the same time. Often the caring parent gets sick as well. If you had three kids, that can be $60 in one go for scripts. That is a real situation, a real world—not a fanciful, exaggerated one—and one that all families are now going to have to contemplate facing as a result of this. In addition, concession card holders are going to have to pay an extra 50c a script, and without any compensating increase in the pensions that we have always sought to make available in the past to compensate for any necessary increases in that area.

We are seeing that now at work. One of the biggest benefits of Medicare, as everyone in the community appreciates, is that many doctors are prepared to bulk&amp;hyphen;bill their patients. We now have a situation where this government has decided that the Medicare schedule, which in simple terms says how much money is paid by the government to the doctor, will not be indexed for inflation this year. It is the case—the signs from the medical profession are already very apparent—that a great many doctors will now decide, with increasing numbers in this category as the situation works itself out over the years ahead, that it is no longer worth bulk&amp;hyphen;billing. If these doctors charge their patients the AMA recommended fee, patients who used to be bulk&amp;hyphen;billed could right now have to pay up to $10 per consultation out of their own pockets.

           Home and community care is something that we increasingly associate with families who have to look after elderly parents or in&amp;hyphen;laws. It is not just a problem for pensioners or people living alone. The home and community care program has been very significantly funded by the Commonwealth government to provide a range of services for frail elderly and, for that matter, frail young people living at home—home nursing, home maintenance, meals on wheels, respite care, day centre care and so on. Now we have a situation where there will be reduced funding for those services and increased user charges required to fill the gap amounting to some $6.30 per hour. As a result, a pensioner using three hours a week or so of HACC services—which seems to be the norm around the country—will have to pay up to $18.90 a week, nearly $1,000 a year, in increased user charges; again, part of the burden that in a great many instances is not just falling on specific disadvantaged groups but falling on the families of whom those groups or individuals are a part.

There has been a massive cut in Commonwealth funding to the  states. More is yet to come. I have already spoken of that impact in the context of hospital funding, but there are many other ways in which the implications of this will bear upon, impact upon, ordinary families.

         —The greatest deception that has been played on the Australian people has been played by those opposite. We have just heard 30 minutes of absolute claptrap by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). The greatest deception played on the Australian people was that the Labor Party were not prepared to tell us the situation in the books of this nation. They hid it from us. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was a prime player in that. At the end of the day, it is Australians that are paying the penalty for Labor's mismanagement over 13 years.

        Let us look on the bright side. New Year's Day 1997 will be a particularly happy day for thousands of Longman families because the Liberal&amp;hyphen;National government tax cuts for low and middle income Australian families will be delivered. That is very much in contrast to New Year's Day 1996. That was going to be a happy day for Australian families and Australian workers as well. The l-a-w tax cuts which were going to be brought in were our Clayton's tax cuts: the tax cut you have when you do not really have a tax cut. You talk about it and tell everyone about it, but at the end of the day you don't deliver. That is pretty much what we have seen from 13 years of Labor: talk about things and get people's hopes up but, for goodness sake, don't deliver.

         generations. For too long it has been middle Australia which has borne the brunt of the previous Labor government's high taxing policies. Until now there has been no recognition of the extra financial burden working parents carry. There have been no incentives for families to choose to have one of the parents care for the family in the home.

        The focus throughout the 1980s and the 1990s was very much on DINKs—double income, no kids. No section of the community is any more important than any other and there should never be any undue attention given to one section of the society, particularly when it is at the cost of another. This initiative is designed to redress this balance. The time is well overdue for the government and the nation to recognise not only the expense of raising children but also the long-term social impact of having a strong family unit in this nation. This tax cut will put more cash into the pockets of working Australian families.

        The Labor Party failed Australia. In particular, they failed middle and low income families, the very people they purport to represent. The Labor government saw an ever increasing need for the welfare state, which only detracted from the contribution of working families. It does not really reconcile with their rhetoric.

        To better understand the failure of this previous government and to better understand the way they have come to their decisions in the past, I thought I could reflect upon some of the comments of the opposition spokesman, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), on 21 August, just one day after the budget in this House, when referring to this measure and referring to Australian families. I will give three examples.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        First, she referred to a two&amp;hyphen;income family with two dependent children. She referred to this particular family as having one income of $32,000, the motor mechanic husband, and another income of $35,000, that of the wife as a sales assistant. That is typecasting if ever I have seen it. Perhaps the wife should have been the motor mechanic. That gave that family an income of $67,000.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        She then moved in her comments to Penrith, a topic which is dear to many people's
        <break page="4738" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         hearts at this stage. In this particular case she had a teacher earning $39,000 and a mother earning $36,000, for a total income of $75,000. The third example she gave was of a single income earner on $68,000.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Labor Party's spokesman on the family referred to middle income earners receiving $67,000, $75,000 and $68,000 respectively. The reality of the situation is that the average family income in Australia today isn't $60,000, $50,000 or $40,000; it is $34,654. That is the average income of Australian families. It is nothing like the $60,000 and $70,000 she referred to when she discussed average Australian families. She must mix in much different circles from the people she claims to represent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If you look at figures on the families in my electorate from the 1991 census, you see that the average family income there was only $28,593—a far cry from the $60,000 and $70,000 that the opposition spokesman mentioned. The fact is that 42 per cent of all families in the Longman electorate actually earned, as a total family income, less than $30,000. Those earning under $20,000 represented 25 per cent of Australian families. Yet she stood up in here and cried poor when she referred to families earning $60,000 and $70,000. I suggest to the member for Jagajaga that she get out in the real world, talk to real people and see what they earn. They will just laugh at the cases she raised in this place.

        Let us look at what Labor did over the last four years under the former Prime Minister. The last four years has seen revenue to the federal government increase by a total of $28.1 billion. How does the government get revenue? There is only one way—tax. They rip it out of the pockets of Australian families. That is what they have been doing for 13 years, but they honed that skill to a fine art over the last four years. Add to that additional borrowings of $74 billion and the selling off of a couple of Australian assets, Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, predominantly overseas, raising another $8.7 billion.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         Over the last four years, they raised an additional $110.8 billion. You would think, out of that, they would give something back to Australian families—just something. Any thing at all would be appreciated, but they got not a red razoo. Not a cent went back to Australian families. The then government continued to pull money out by putting on additional sales tax and creating new sales taxes. In their last budget they put up fuel tax, which impacts on middle income families as much as on anyone, by 5c and 7c a litre. They put up the price of an average car by increasing sales tax on cars. That obviously put them out of the price range of most families.

       <para>
        That quote is one that we could all take to heart and think about when we deliberate in this place on any number and range of bills. It was delivered by a fine former ALP Prime Minister, John Curtin. I think those opposite would do well to put it up in their party room and have a read of it each morning so that they can refocus on the needs of the Australian family as opposed to what they have been doing. They no longer consider themselves responsible for the continuation of the national interest by looking after Australian families.

        I think everybody in this place over the past election campaign would have had the comment made to them from Australian workers and families, particularly low and middle income earners, that they would be better off on the dole—`Why bother working? I would be better off if I threw the job in and I went on the unemployment benefit.' The fact is that
        <break page="4739" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         a family of five—husband and wife and three children—will receive approximately $1,000 from social security. I do not deride that—that is a very important safety net that is in place for Australian families that are unemployed—but the problem is that a metalworker who is on the current award wage is less than $100 a week gross better off than the unemployed person. That is before you take into account his work related expenses, his tools, his cost of getting to and from work and his clothing, not to mention his exorbitant union fees, which very often do not actually repay him anything in real kind.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The point I want to make is that this tax initiative—giving money back to Australian families—ensures that this government recognises the importance that these people play in contributing to Australia's improving productivity, and the role that they play as parents is important. We recognise it and we feel that it is important that they continue that role. We do not want to see Australians take the easy option that some people see of going on unemployment benefits. It does not set the right role model for Australians, it does not set a role model for their children and it obviously reduces productivity.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us have another look at what the Labor Party has done in its time here. Back in 1982-83—they came to power in 1983—the average Australian working family had a tax take of 14.1 per cent; 14.1 per cent of their money went into consolidated revenue. By the time they had left, through PAYE tax obviously, it had grown to 16 per cent. These are the people who can least afford to take that extra money out of their pocket and have it delivered to the government. They need it to survive. What we are trying to achieve here is in some measure to start to repay them and put some money back into their pockets through these tax initiatives.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I mentioned earlier, these families also saw petrol prices rise through Mr Keating's hand in their pockets. The price of cars went up. He even tried to put up tax on building materials, which would have inevitably increased the price of the family home. Let us take that Australian dream totally out of the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         possibility and the realm of them trying to achieve it.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What the Labor Party did in every instance was take from Australian families. They increased Medicare levies and they increased the threshold for pharmaceutical benefits, yet they come into this place screaming and yelling that we are being irresponsible. For once, Australian families have had something returned to them. I hope that it is only the first of a series of measures that this government, through fiscal management, will be able to put in place to respond to Australian families.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We come to the l-a-w tax cuts. A closer examination of those tax cuts really flies in the face of everything that Labor has ever spoken about. I will read the fundamental objectives of these tax scales as purported by Labor: first, to reduce the marginal tax rate facing the greater majority of the full&amp;hyphen;time work force, including those on medium and average wages, from 38 per cent to 34 per cent; and, secondly, to reduce the marginal tax rate for those earning up to $50,000 per year, almost twice that of the family income of those in Longman, by 46 per cent to 40 per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So what were the Labor Party going to give in their Clayton's tax cuts to the Australian family—the people in Longman who needed that money? If you earnt under $20,700 you could imagine that you would expect to receive something from a Labor government. The reality is that you did not receive a cent—zilch, zero, not one dollar! Not one dollar was to flow into the pockets of families or individuals earning under $20,700. In doing so, they immediately wrote off a great percentage of the families in my electorate and those throughout Australia. Who were they really representing? They certainly were not representing the people who work in my electorate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would also like to mention the accord, which was trumpeted back in 1983 when Prime Minister Hawke came to power. It was going to put some equity into the marketplace. It was going to allow these working Australians to benefit from an accord. If we look at a metalworker in that period from
        <break page="4740" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         1983 to 1995, their award has increased in that time by $119. If we compare it with a public servant on SES level 2, for argument's sake, who also benefited from the accord, you would imagine that his wage would have gone up by about the same amount. Labor likes to see things fairly. No. The reality is that the metalworker's wage increased by $119 and the public servant's went up by $513. That is a difference of $294 today in the hand of the metalworker opposed to this public servant.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is not being equitable. That is not responding to average Australian families. That is why the rich got richer and the poor got poorer under Labor. Because we are bringing in a tax relief at the lowest level, impacting on all middle and low income families, we are responding to Australians' greatest needs.

        In short, in 13 years Labor failed to deliver. It was as simple as that. We saw that on 2 March. But in reality that was played out just after the previous election. In the 1993 election Labor was as shocked as many Australians were when they were brought back to power, and the truth of the matter hit home. They had been deluded. The wool had been pulled over their eyes for the last time. The die had been cast. They no longer wanted to hear the rhetoric and the claptrap of `bringing home the bacon' and all the other fabulous comments and great figures that we heard from the previous Treasurer and Prime Minister.

        The Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill, which does deliver money into Australian families' pockets, does two things.

         You would think that this was a new phenomenon and that the Labor Party would be pleased to hear it. But I wonder why it is that the member for Jagajaga, the opposition spokesman, has not chosen to even speak on this bill when it falls  within  her  responsibil ity. You will not see her in here. It deals with families, I remind the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). Whenever she has the opportunity, she speaks long and loud in this parliament about families. Here is a tax matter which is going to go to the heart of helping Australian families, and she does not want to speak about it. She does not want to open her mouth.

         —I recall the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) last year saying that the more politicians talk about the past, the more they demonstrate that they have no answers for the future. I think that anyone in the public gallery today, listening to this broadcast or subsequently reading the

         would appreciate that the member for Longman (Mr Brough) has no answers for the future, because he is obsessed with the past. I would have thought that a new member to this place, a new government representative, would have been talking about the government's strategy for families. In that regard, his argument has crumbled in his own hands.

        He is condemned by his own words because he said that the worst thing any government can do to families in Australia is to increase the take on PAYE tax collections. Yet that is what the government is doing in its 1996-97 budget. By his own words he has condemned the economic strategy of the Treasurer (Mr Costello). If he consults the revenue estimates in the budget, he will find that gross PAYE taxation revenue for 1996-97 is up by 8.3 per cent. It is up by a whopping $4.3 billion. Of that amount, the government can explain away 1.5 per cent in employment growth for the year average. It can explain away a forecast earnings growth of 4&amp;half; per cent. So six per cent of the 8.3 per cent comes in the form of nominal GDP growth.

       <para first-indent="16">
        What about the other 2.3 per cent? That is fiscal drag. It is bracket creep. This government is taking away a huge amount from working Australians, from gross PAYE, by kicking people into higher brackets without tax indexation. For all individuals, the amount gets even worse. The increase in taxation revenue for individuals for 1996-97 is $5&amp;half; billion. A lot of that is coming out of the electorate of Longman. The bracket creep within that category is a whopping $1.8 billion. Compare that to this very small amount for the family tax initiative, which is

        For the average family in the seats of Longman, Bonython, Werriwa, Warringah, and every other seat in the country, this means that for every dollar the government provides in its family tax initiative, it is taking away $8.30 in bracket creep through gross PAYE tax collections. As to tax on individuals, for every dollar the government provides in its family tax initiative it is taking away almost $13 extra in tax from individuals for 1996-97. So your families in Longman are going backwards under this government and this budget.

        The member for Longman and his colleagues are condemned by their own words. This is a straight&amp;hyphen;out tax swindle. For every $1 in this so-called family tax initiative, $13 is being swept away in bracket creep as people move into higher brackets in Longman and all the other electorates because this government will not introduce tax indexation.

        This is a John Howard special—a tax promise, a fistful of dollars that he is handing over with one hand to rip back $13 with the other hand. He is giving $1 with one hand, but $13 is being ripped back out of the pockets of individual taxpayers in Australia with his other hand.

        A lot of the members opposite are probably concerned about fiscal drag. I can imagine now the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) up in his room listening to this broadcast. He has heard me talk about fiscal drag in the budget. He probably thinks it is something that should be arrested. He is probably going to organise an anti-sodomy march down the main street of Burnie to do something about fiscal drag. He should do something about it. It does not take a march. It does not take the police arresting someone.

         He should do something about it. He should be recommending at the Lyons Forum and standing up in other government forums saying, `This government should be fair dinkum and should be in the business of tax indexation.' It should not be here saying that it is introducing a so&amp;hyphen;called family tax initia tive—$1 given in one hand and $13 taken back with the other. If you are serious about helping families in Australia, do not be in the business of a $5&amp;half; billion increase in taxation revenue, of a $2 billion net revenue increase in the budget over the next two years or of increasing tax as a proportion of GDP by 0.4 per cent.

        Again, the member for Longman was talking about the historical record, a period 10 to 15 years ago, when tax went up as a proportion of GDP. What is it for this budget? It is going up by nearly half a per cent of GDP, and it is happening in Longman and every other of the 147 federal electorates. You are condemned by your own words. I am sure the Treasurer is appalled to hear these things in the House of Representatives from a new government member. He is setting the criteria, setting the high jump bar, knowing full well the Treasurer has not even got off the landing mat. He is doing a sort of belly flop straight onto the landing mat because of the criteria set by his own colleague, the member for Longman.

        These things need to be placed on the public record. They need to be understood by Australian families. The bottom line is, when they are filling out their tax returns some 12 months from now and they are looking at their rates, their brackets, and the very low level of return on this family tax initiative, they will know the impact. They will know the tax swindle. They will know fully the extent of the tax fraud. They will also understand that this government is more interested in hurting people than helping them.

For 20 years the member for Bennelong, the now Prime Minister, has been running around every public forum in Australia—Catholic welfare and family associations, anywhere they give him a microphone—talking about the virtues of income splitting. Whatever happened to income splitting?

For every $1 they provide in that initiative, they are ripping back $13 with the bracket creep. The Lyons Forum, for this measure and all the rhetoric from the other side, does not even have the virtue of consistency. I would have thought the member for Warringah, based on his past policy pronouncements, would be moving an amendment to introduce his $6 billion flat, non means tested, so-called homemakers allowance, but he is sitting there with a wry smile on his face. He knows that he got done over at the Lyons Forum.

        No wonder the Prime Minister has gone overseas. He could not be here for the debate because after 20 years of personal commitment to income splitting, 20 years of staking his political reputation on that idea, he has been knocked over as well. So it is a sorry old day for the integrity and consistency of the coalition. It is a sorry old day, indeed, for Australian families because they have been misled by this lifelong commitment to income splitting to deliver a miserly $147 million family tax initiative in this budget, which rips back so much more in bracket creep and fiscal drag.

        It is interesting that the Lyons Forum have developed these policies. I always find their name ironic. I think they take their name from Joe Lyons. He was perhaps Australia's most prolific Prime Minister ever. He had 12 children. He was prolific. He was a family man through and through.

         the coalition government—that is, Enid Lyons. So much for the rhetoric that a woman's place is in the home. After the passing of her husband, Enid Lyons said that a woman's place was in the House—that is, the House of Representatives. She was the first female member in this House, and she did it as a widower. There was no white picket fence for Enid Lyons with the male working as the breadwinner for the family, the dependent children. There was no white picket fence for Enid Lyons.

        So, for all the Lyons Forum rhetoric about their model family—the traditional nuclear family with a white picket fence in Australia—they have to appreciate the other side of the coin. That makes a very important point about family diversity. Since the time of Joe and Enid Lyons and John Curtin, Australian family types have diversified incredibly—the widowers, divorcees and single parents who are working, the double income families; the growth in no&amp;hyphen; and two&amp;hyphen;income families in Australia has seen the great diversification of family type and earning capacity. That poses a very real challenge for both sides of politics.

        I make no secret of the fact that a major challenge for left of centre parties is how to deal with the way in which the assumptions upon the postwar welfare state have fundamentally changed. The postwar welfare state was based on the idea of a traditional nuclear family—the male breadwinner bringing home a living wage to support the children and the family unit, with the wife staying at home to look after the children. That is no longer the typical family type in Australia in the 1990s.

In fact, that type is the minor stream when one looks at the figures broken down in Australian demographics.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         that is a very important point to make—that people without partners should have a rightful place in the workplace. They should have a place in the house, and they should have a place in the work force. Of course, the fact that they have dependent children should not be a barrier to that. For all the rhetoric of the Lyons Forum, they need to take stock.

They should be treated in the same manner with government tax scales and government policy as women and men who want to take a place in the work force. There should not be one rule, one set of laws, for Australians who want to fulfil the image of a white picket fence family, and another set of rules and laws for Australians who do not fit in with that stereotype of their free choice in a free and open society.

        There is nothing mainstream about this legislation. The shadow Treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), incorporated a graph showing that the full benefit of this family tax initiative was restricted to just 13 per cent of Australian families—because 50 per cent of our family types have no dependants; and, of the 50 per cent who do, three per cent earn too much under these provisions and 47 per cent are technically eligible. But single parents do not qualify for part A of the benefits in the bill; the two parents who are earning qualify only for part A and not B; and parents not earning do not pay tax at all, so they get no benefit out of the bill. Who does that leave? That leaves the `one parent earning, white picket fence family', the traditional nuclear family in Australia—13 per cent of the family types.

        That is so different from the time of Curtin and Joe and Enid Lyons; that is not the mainstream Australian family. That is not the majority. That is a minor part of the incredible diversity of Australian family types. `Diversity' should be our buzz word in this parliament. Choice and support for families in need should be the basis of taxation and other policies. Mr Howard is well outside the `main stream' with this provision. He is swimming

If in the future the female partner in those families were to give birth to a child and after a period of time tried to re-enter the work force, she and her family would have an active disincentive placed in their way. It is to the lasting shame of this government that it is in the business of social engineering—and, in the seat of Lindsay, social engineering in a fashion that runs down government support and opportunity for families in that particular part of western Sydney.

        As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said in his second reading speech, the family tax initiative provides two forms of assistance. The first increases the tax free threshold by $1,000 for one parent in a family for each dependent child up to the age of 16 and each dependent secondary student up to 18 years. The assistance will be available to families which have a combined and taxable income of less than $70,000.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The increase in the threshold means that a family will save tax at a rate of about 20c in the dollar. Eligible families will, therefore, receive the equivalent of an increase of $200 per annum in their disposable income for each dependent child.

This is available to families where the sole income earner earns $65,000 or less a year. For example, a single income family earning less than $68,000 a year with two dependent children which takes out private health insurance will be $51.90 per fortnight better off.

Labor are in for a long decade in the wilderness if they keep insulting the intelligence of the Australian families with a deceitful scare campaign. The days of the scare campaign are over. Australian families want positive policy targeting their needs. If the Labor Party do not learn this, they will end up like the shadow Treasurer, suffering from a terminal `relevance deprivation syndrome'. The coalition's Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill 1996 is a positive policy for Australia, and I commend it to the House.

          Bill 1996 to indicate that—far from having the benefits ascribed to it by the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace), who has just finished speaking—it actually has very detrimental effects on a great many families. Rather than generalising about that, I propose to read from a series of letters that I have, particularly on the question of increased child&amp;hyphen;care costs.

        These tax measures are not about `mainstream Australia'—now a much abused phrase by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)—nor about the battlers. It is actually, as one commentator put it, about the chosen few—a minority of Australian families. Some 13 per cent of the 4.8 million families actually benefit from this, and even many of those will have to meet additional costs as a result of cuts to the budget that paid for these tax breaks.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What I want to say—and I think it is very important that this be said clearly—is that this and other measures in the budget represent a very significant and direct and calculated attack on women and their families. It is an attack on women who choose to work part&amp;hyphen;time or full&amp;hyphen;time, women who are studying and women who want a break sometimes from their children, even if they are at home as the principal caregiver. This is a direct frontal attack on their interests, and they are beginning to realise that that is precisely what is happening.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not an accident. It is part of a philosophy that has formed part of the right wing of the Liberal Party for a very long time. There is the idea that women's choices should be restricted, that they should be at home providing care for their children, that they are the principal caregivers, that they cannot aspire to a career or an education. If they do, it is basically so they can make intelligent conversation with their partners, not so they have a role themselves.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It misunderstands the very significant social changes that have taken place in Australia, from a time when the majority of women did indeed stay home and look after their preschool age and older children. I might say, at that time most families were considerably larger than they are today. Most women in
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Australia today have only one or two children at most, so their lives are not going to be totally determined by their role as mothers. They take that role very seriously. Every one of them, myself included, who has that responsibility takes it absolutely seriously.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        None of us wants to be told by the government how we shall live our lives, and that is precisely what is happening in this budget. The Prime Minister and others within government are saying, `The choices that you make, the arrangements that you make, are not yours to make. We will actually penalise you financially if you have certain types of arrangements that are now commonplace in Australia.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The majority of families in most electorates are two-income families—sometimes only from a part-time income. Many of them have young children of preschool age who require decent child care. One of the revolutions of the past 20 years has been the recognition that child care is as important to working families, to women in particular, as the tools of a trade are to a plumber or to a building assistant.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To take away child care, to make it too expensive for those families, is to prevent them earning a decent living. I would have thought that was what any government was about; to allow the family to support itself, to allow the family to make its own decisions without interference from government. Some people have suggested that this represents a form of social engineering. I endorse that view because it clearly is. Women are also getting the message. They are beginning to understand that this government is saying, `Stay home and look after your children. Give up your educational aspirations. Give up the need to keep your technical skills fresh by working part&amp;hyphen;time while the children are young or we'll hit you for six economically.'

        As the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) said in his speech, in some cases those who return to the work force find it extremely difficult because of the effective marginal tax rates in some cases of 120 per cent.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The claim that gets the biggest response—and this is not being made by politicians; it is being made by men and women standing up in these meetings—is from women saying, `If John Howard wants to send me back home to constrain my choices, he should think again. I will not be dictated too.' That gets an enormous round of applause and cheers. This is not coming from women who are privileged. Many of these women come from single income families, many of whom are struggling. I would like to read from a few of the letters that have been sent to me, copies of which have gone to Judi Moylan. These are people in my electorate. My electorate is very mixed. It includes low income families, some pretty well off professional and technical people, a lot of students and a fair number of single parents. This letter is from one of those single parents and reads:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Judi,

       </para>
       <para>
        That is what is happening in these budgets. These tax breaks go to a very small number of families anyway, and for most of them they are immediately washed away by huge increases in child&amp;hyphen;care costs, not to mention pharmaceuticals and health costs. The letter further reads:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">

         That is their choice. Why should they be prevented from exercising it? The letter further reads:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Why are you damaging the financial and emotional security of so many families like ours? There is NO benefit to our children, our community and our families in this—and we will fight you over it.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is certainly a message that I want to give to the Prime Minister and the minister responsible for this area of child care. It is no good giving tax breaks to families when they are insultingly small compared with what you are taking away and when you put these big barriers in front of the exercising of their choice and you undermine the arrangements that they have already made for their family income, for their security and for their future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another example is from a young woman who is doing the right thing and studying. She is trying to ensure that she is able to help support her family. The letter reads:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

        <para>
         That is what will happen to a lot of these people, with the combination of the removal of the operational subsidy and other changes. It further reads:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

        </para>
        <para>
         Another hit, because you are allowed to keep them open only 50 hours. A lot of people have factored this in. They know what the equation looks like. The letter continues:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         After the family tax package I am $70 pw worse off.
        </para>

         How does that help this struggling family? The letter states:

        </para>
        <para>
         That is a reasonable choice for a human being to make. Just because she is a woman does not mean she should not be able to make that choice. The letter further reads:

        <para>
         Many letters of that kind have been sent to Judi Moylan, and a lot of them have been sent to us as members representing these women in the community. I think one of them puts it very poignantly. It is a very simple little fax which states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

        </para>
        <para>
         That is just a summary of the very great concern that many parents are expressing to me and to other members. They note that there has been a tax rebate offered to them. Many of them can take advantage of only part A of that, and at the same time they are getting the big increases in child&amp;hyphen;care costs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to go through some of the child&amp;hyphen;care changes in detail because this is one of the great betrayals. During the election campaign the shadow minister at the time and the Prime Minister said that they would maintain the system and, what is more, improve it. They were critical of some elements of our child&amp;hyphen;care policy. They indicated that they would maintain the system of child&amp;hyphen;care assistance that existed. Have they done that? No. The child&amp;hyphen;care assistance system has been radically changed in this budget, with cuts of more than $73 million in the first year. How can you stand up and say that is not a significant change? It is a clear breach of promise; a clear breach of commitment to these people. Again, quoting from the policy document:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A Coalition Government will maintain the non&amp;hyphen;means tested Childcare Cash Rebate.
        </para>
        <para>
         Again there is a clear breach of promise. I know it is fashionable to say that this affects only the wealthy, but a lot of the families—the two&amp;hyphen;income families, the families of Lindsay who will be looking at this in the next few weeks—may well be two teachers, a nurse and a teacher, or a clerical assistant and a teacher; hardly people at the top end of town. The child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate is now subject to a means test. It is a breach of promise, if nothing else. The coalition promised:

         </para>
         <para>
          What a joke, because in removing the operational subsidies from community based care you are basically saying, `We don't care if these centres go to the wall.' Either they will have to put their fees up through the roof or they can be privatised and set free in the wider market.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Parents who are using community based centres have chosen them. Many of those parents, indeed, cannot find appropriate care in the private sector, either because they have young children below the age of two and there are not enough places for them in the private sector or because there are significant advantages in the community based sector for children who have special needs.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is another point, one which I think the government has overlooked. Those centres are the longest standing in our community and they are run by parents for parents, not by individuals outside the system for profit. What the government is basically saying is, `We don't care if parents continue to have a role in child care, in its management and its design. As far as we are concerned, the private sector can do it all.' We do not say that anywhere else in the system—we have a balance, we have a mix. Yet here parents are actually being told that they cannot have choice any more. The policy document said:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Liberal and National Parties will strengthen parents' right to choose those arrangements.
         </para>
         <para>
          Yet the part B tax initiative penalises them, because if you are working you do not get all the tax break. Again that is a very clear disincentive to families, along with the child care cuts. The coalition went on to say:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          A Liberal/National Party Government will continue to support the creation of additional places to meet the current un&amp;hyphen;met demand . . .

         <para>
          What a joke. It has all been pulled out in this budget—no further expansion, none at all. It is as if we had already met the targets, not just for women who want to go into the work force but for those requiring education and a significant number of women who are at home with their pre school age children but who sensibly say that from time to time their
          <break page="4751" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         <para first-indent="16">
          With small families it is absolutely critical that young children have opportunities to socialise and that parents, particularly mothers at home with children, have a break from their children. That is something that any decent psychologist would recognise, yet this government appears to be ignoring the advice of its own experts—I know they exist—from the Department of Health and Family Services. I am sure they would have told members of the government the likely impact of these changes.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What we are seeing is that not only has each and every one of those promises been broken but the government has actually taken half a billion dollars out of the system. How is it being made up? It comes out of the pockets of the families who are struggling to provide for their own security. They are being told, `Here is a little bit back. We'll take out half a billion dollars and we will give you back a small proportion of that.' Australians are not stupid. Women are not stupid. They can read that message.

          Some of them will not read it until their particular child&amp;hyphen;care centre has its fees go through the roof, until they realise that they are being denied the same level of child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate as they formerly had. Perhaps they will not realise it until they see the staffing levels at their centre being cut and the level of expertise diminished—with more 15-year-olds, who can be paid peanuts, rotating through the system and with no continuity of care for their children. That is when those who have not yet seen what is coming at them will wake up. But many of them already are aware of it, as I pointed out, because the measures to abolish the operating subsidies for community centres, the changes to the income disallowance for child&amp;hyphen;care assistance and so on, represent a massive assault on the women of this community.

          In case members opposite are under any illusions about this, let me give them a couple of examples, and not unrealistic examples I am sure you will agree.

           so her husband or partner can take care of the children, yes, that family is better off as a result of this budget. That part of that 13 per cent cohort is better off by about $25 a week. But that is not taking account of changes to pharmaceutical and other costs that they are going to have to meet as a result of the budget. However, just looking at the balance between child care and this family tax initiative, that family is better off.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Let us have a look now at more realistic scenarios since we know the majority of families are working families, dual&amp;hyphen;income families. Take a two&amp;hyphen;income family with two children aged one and two and just for the moment let us suppose they are living in Penrith, since it is on everyone's minds. Say that the wife is a sales assistant on $22,000 a year and the husband a motor mechanic on $25,000. That is a combined family income of $47,000, not an unrealistic scenario in the homes of the battlers that you claim to represent. They are both earning below average weekly earnings, but an average is an average so inevitably some families fall below it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Let us say they have children in community based child care for 50 hours a week. Again, that is not an unreasonable scenario; there are plenty like that in my electorate. Let us assume further that they have no private health insurance. Again, that represents the majority of Australians. Sixty-six per cent of Australians do not have private health insurance; they choose Medicare. What the government is giving is the family tax initiative part A for the two children—$7.70—and no part B because the spouse is earning. You remove the operational subsidy from child care of $21 a child per week. That is $42 a week additional cost to them, and restrictions on child-care assistance mean that there is another $13.80 a week cost.

          What is the effect on that family? That family—the battlers if you want to call them that, people who are doing it hard—will under your generous arrangements be paying an additional $48 a week, even with the tax benefits that you claim to be giving them. You can go up the income scale and find the same arrangements. For example, take a two-income family with one dependent child aged
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           two years and both parents senior teachers. You might say they are relatively well off as they have incomes of about $35,000 each. The child is in a full-time private care centre for 50 hours and they have no private health insurance. That family—even that relatively privileged family—is nearly $10 a week worse off after you have had your way with them.

          I must say they are not unique scenarios.

         —I am delighted to stand up in this debate and defend the government's decisions in respect of family care. In fact, the opposition has very little credibility at all on this or any other issue and the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), in particular, is really straining things to stand up here and talk with any credibility about family policy.

        The former government, the now opposition, did enormous damage to families over the 13 years that they were on this side of the House. For them to stand up here and criticise this legislation in any way at all just reeks of plain hypocrisy as far as I am concerned.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am proud to be a member of a government now that has finally recognised the importance of families within our society. All we have heard today from the member for Fremantle is some of the sort of ideology that was rammed down our throats year after year for the whole 13 years that we put up with the former government. We understand the importance of child care but in the end what the former government did, through its great penchant for social engineering, was to create a situation where some parents had access to child care and others did not. The system that the former government introduced discriminated against stay&amp;hyphen;at&amp;hyphen;home mothers. Why? Because people like the member for Fremantle, who leads the feminist charge in this place, wanted to create a situation whereby
        <break page="4753" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         women were forced or coerced or conscripted into the work force. It is as simple as that.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Our policies in relation to child care are aimed at creating equality of choice for people about what is the best care for their child, not to create a situation where they are forced by virtue of the arrangements that were put in place by the former government to take child care on a take&amp;hyphen;it&amp;hyphen;or&amp;hyphen;leave&amp;hyphen;it basis. In other words, you take the sort of child care we have to offer you on our terms, the government's terms—that is, you get it if you go out to work or you stay home and take care of your own kids and do not get it. Or, even more ludicrously, you stay home and you actually can be in a situation where you can be paid to care for somebody else's children but not your children. That is the system that you are defending. That is the system that the member for Fremantle stands up here and attempts to defend. It is ridiculous. So the former government's policies discriminated against families. The former government's policies prevented families from making their own choices about what was best for them and what was best for the care of their own children.

        I believe that on 2 March this year the Australian people took a very definite decision. They had had enough of that sort of social engineering, that sort of pandering to minority groups that the former government was famous for. They took a step in voting for a coalition government that I believe said very clearly that they want an end to all that sort of intrusion in their lives, and that is what this government will deliver to them. There is no greater example of that than the family tax initiative legislation that we are actually debating in this House today.

        This legislation not only delivers a key election promise by John Howard to Australian families but also delivers a fairly substantial turnaround in public policy. This legislation is a watershed for Australian families. It is a divide. It draws a line in the sand between the anti&amp;hyphen;family bias in the family policy of the previous government and the pro&amp;hyphen;family stance of this Howard government. It really is as stark as that. It draws that line between anti&amp;hyphen;family and pro&amp;hyphen;family. We were

        Although the budget achieved a lot for Australia, nothing more clearly exemplifies the underlying philosophy of John Howard and his government than this particular legislation. The legislation is symbolic because it is indicative of the Howard government's commitment to Australian families. As one who has in this place proudly defended families at every opportunity, I say that the merit or the virtue of this legislation is not so much in the dollars, because we could go a lot further than this, and I might have been one who advocated or hoped that we could go further than the $1 billion that this package costs. What it does is point to a direction in which I believe Australian families want to go.

        In that respect, it is the first step in a journey back to prosperity for Australian families. I do not mean prosperity in a material sense necessarily; I mean that Australian families can now, with a John Howard led government, have a sense of wellbeing, a feeling of confidence that they have not been and will not be forgotten by the Howard government. They will no longer have the sense of despair, of marginalisation and of being discriminated against that was so evident amongst Australian families under the former government.

        As we emerge from those 13 years, it has become very clear that Australian families were forgotten—or, worse, that they were actually denigrated by the policy makers of the Australian Labor Party, particularly those like the member for Fremantle. Traditional families were denigrated. Families who wanted to make the choice to have a stay&amp;hyphen;at&amp;hyphen;home mum or a stay&amp;hyphen;at&amp;hyphen;home dad—a stay&amp;hyphen;at&amp;hyphen;home parent—were denigrated by people of their ilk.
       </para>

        For that reason, the majority of Australian families are certainly glad to see the end of the Labor government. Those people have emerged not unscathed but unbowed in their

        We are now entering the post&amp;hyphen;feminist era. This is particularly good news for families. In her excellent 1995 John Bonython lecture at the Centre for Independent Studies, Professor Brigitte Berger, Professor of Sociology at Boston University, said that the 1960s and 1970s circumstances had:

       </para>
       <para>
        In my view, that aptly sums up exactly what we had from 13 years of Labor government in this country. In her lecture, Professor Berger develops a very persuasive argument for the close link between middle&amp;hyphen;class family, economic prosperity and political liberalism. She says further:

        The majority of governmental efforts to supplement and circumvent the functions of traditional family, with a few notable exceptions, have not achieved a lot.

        Professor Berger was mainly speaking about the United States, but we are finally getting there in Australia. President Clinton declared recently that governments do not raise children—families do. They have come to that point in the United States. We are getting there too.

She also has the audacity to suggest that I support Pauline Hanson populism, as she puts it. I assure this House I do not. In fact, quite to the contrary, I found very little indeed to agree with in anything the member for Oxley said in her speech. I am on the record as taking that position and I am quite happy to be. It does not worry me that 95 per cent of Australians agree with some of the incredible remarks she made. The fact is that I do not agree. For Eva Cox to even imply that those who believe in some of the things I and many of us on this side, and even some on the other side, believe in would agree with Pauline Hanson is quite offensive.

        The legislation we are dealing with is a recognition not only that families are important but also that it makes sense to support families—not just from a social policy perspective, although in this place I have often argued that it does that and it certainly does, but it just makes good economic sense as well, which ultimately appears to be Professor Berger's thesis too. The cost of family breakdown is incalculable. There have been attempts over the years to calculate what the actual cost is and you can add all sorts of things into it and the dollars add up and add up but in the end you can't even begin to put a price on the social costs that are associated with family breakdown.

        However, to quote the former Labor leader, the caravan has moved on, and you will have to move with it. You might not like that but Australia has changed a bit—2 March was the watershed when that change really came to light. You have been left behind but you will catch up inevitably; you will have to catch up. This legislation is indicative of the direction this government is going to go in. What it is going to do is give families more responsibility, more choice, more ability to look after themselves. People plainly got tired of having their affairs run for them by the intrusive and interventionist and social engineering government that we had for so many years. People got tired of that and 2 March, as I say, was the point where they made their position very clear indeed. Because of that, the relevance deprivation syndrome must be very painful. It is obviously also catching. For a while you are just going to have to get to like it, because the Australian people made you largely irrelevant at the last election.

        The legislation that we are dealing with today, the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill, is underpinned by a number of important principles. The most important one is that children need families—family breakdown hurts kids, divorce is bad for kids and kids thrive in a functional family environment. That is what underpins this legislation. That is what this legislation ultimately is about doing, in terms of giving money back to families with children—money that has been taken off them and redistributed to all sorts of great programs that the former government used to cook up. I do not think there would be much argument now, although there was for a couple of decades, that no alternative can work. There were plenty of alternatives thrust upon us but they have not worked. We have to realise, finally, that families work and they have to be supported, they have to be encouraged. This legislation, ultimately, is aimed at doing that.

It is hard to believe but that is what we had to put up with for 13 years. This is a move away from the discredited tax and welfare systems of the past, which made it difficult for women to choose to stay home. There can now be no doubt that the absence of women from the home has had serious consequences for child rearing, despite the arguments that we might hear from the member for Fremantle. She would be arguing that putting kids into child care as soon as they are born is actually the best way to go. That is ludicrous. That is why she and so many that think that way are totally out of date.

        This legislation also reverses the trend of treating support for families as welfare. The message in this also is vital: this legislation gives a clear signal that we are moving away from saying that caring for children and family benefits are welfare. They are not. Welfare for many families, as it has been for Australians who are not necessarily in a family situation, has become the problem, and it is not the answer.

There is an interdependency within families, not a dependency. A family is an entity. It is not a disparate group of individuals who cohabit for a time, although that was the sort of trendy thinking that was imposed on us. Families are entities, not people who live together for a while.

The fact that it has survived here as it survived in other parts of the world, despite the trendy onslaught of extreme feminist thinking, is an amazing tribute to the fact that it has got that ability to survive.

        More and more, successive governments have used taxation law to secure social priorities, as I am sure you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker. Because this bill is another of this all too familiar kind, that is not reason in itself to do other than welcome the proposals before the House. Family tax assistance is to be there for all families who earn sufficient taxable income to be able to get the benefits through the PAYE system or, if they happen to be self&amp;hyphen;employed, on lodgment of their returns.

         Lower income families are catered for in the second of these cognate bills, the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill 1996, and they will benefit from the alternative approach of the government, which will take the form of a fortnightly cash payment called the family tax payment, or the FTP. That payment can be expected fortnightly for those whose income is low enough to prevent them qualifying through PAYE or the income tax system.

         The coalition is honouring an election promise and is entitled to support for both bills. That it has not backtracked on an undertaking is shaping up as something of an exception rather than the rule, and should be encouraged by acknowledgment. It is especially commendable in this case because the revenue to be forgone must have attracted the attention of and seriously tempted the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his equally commendable efforts to achieve an underlying budget surplus within three years of the new government coming to office.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In that context, it is well known that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had his way, and that is not a bad thing. That should be viewed in the background of some economic comment which, whilst acknowledging that the family tax package was welcome, was of the view that, given the budgetary situation inherited by the Howard government, it really could not be afforded. So the Prime Minister's priorities were very much in evidence in this particular case.

         Indeed, the Prime Minister had the duty and the obligation to honour his undertaking of 18 February last year. The fact that he could not or chose not to take up a few more of the undertakings made about the same time is a matter of regret, but it is also understandable, as I have already indicated, in the budgetary context which was an unconscionable legacy from the Labor government.

         To some extent, as has already been pointed out by some opposition speakers, the benefits will be eroded or otherwise offset by other budget measures.

The effect of these measures will be to redistribute

We are told that in a full year the total cost to revenue—if that is the right way of putting it; I am not comfortable with that expression—is in the vicinity of just over $1,000 million in a full year. I think the first full year will be in 1998-99.

         The government has, in the explanatory memorandum, tried to deal with compliance costs and, under the heading `Compliance cost impact', it gives us some information. It points out that there will be a cost to taxpayers because they are required to understand the rules. They will have to do new calculations. Tax paying families who have shared custody of children will have to do pro rata calculations to determine the benefits they can claim for their family.

         It is surprising, and I am pleased that it is pointed out in the explanatory memorandum, that many taxpayers are expected to have to make agreements with their spouses. The member for Braddon (Mr Miles) might like to reflect on that. We are going along the line of pre&amp;hyphen;marital agreements introduced by the tax act. I think that would be unfortunate.

         It seems to me that because the explanatory memorandum does not attach a cost to the compliance cost impact it is short on the sort of information we would expect. Perhaps it is impossible to put a figure on what it costs the average taxpayer to abide by rules and amendments to the tax laws but it seems strange to me. Perhaps it indicates that the time of wage earning, salary earning taxpayers has no value. If that is the case, I would regret that.

         The end result is that we have no cost estimate. It goes to the mind&amp;hyphen;set of the people preparing the compliance cost impact and perhaps it is something they could address. One thing is certain: this will be just another reason for many taxpayers being driven into the hands of tax agents. I do not say that in any sense of criticism of tax agents because they are by and large very competent people, but there is a considerable cost to taxpayers involved and the more complicated you make the tax law, the more cost to taxpayers, the greater the cost of tax compliance.

         To offset that to some extent the bills being debated cognately are in the simplified format. This will mean that we will have the tax act partly simplified. The greater part of it is yet to be dealt with. I am not sure that the overall result is simplification. Nevertheless, I welcome and support attempts to make the tax laws as simple as humanly possible. That is made all the more difficult, though, when governments use tax laws to secure social outcomes. There must be, and indeed there is, a better way of going about it. But every concession you put into tax law creates an opportunity for some people to minimise their tax and for some to enter into tax avoidance arrangements. I do not think this will be any different. I think there will be people on the margin who will arrange their affairs to receive all or part of the benefits of these measures, which they now would not be entitled to.

This bill has no compliance impact statement. I do not know why that should be so. Perhaps they have incorporated all of the considerations in the second bill.

        What we are trying to do is correct some of the problems of the Labor government that this country has had to bear for some time.

Professor Harding's study—many others have been published and debated at length in this House—revealed that families were far more vulnerable under the previous government and that a far greater proportion of families were ending up in poverty statistics and battling to make ends meet.

I am quite confident that they will be able to cope very admirably with this change, which is designed to put private centres on an equal footing with those community centres.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On that question of child care, the government has also made funds available for those centres that just would not be viable because of their location or because of the nature of their community. There is another important initiative to say yes, child care is important for those two-income families but we have actually done something for those people that have one parent at home. We have actually done something for all families in this country and targeted that support in a very effective way.

         In fact, this legislation before the House represents part of what could be called a kids' quadrella. We have delivered for kids on four key fronts. This is the centrepiece of it, the family tax initiative. We have the health initiatives with the immunisation programs and improving the complementary nature of the public and private health system, so that

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have boosted funding to school education and we have supported parents making choices about their education, just as this family tax initiative supports the choices that parents have to make about how to organise their households. We have also improved the post&amp;hyphen;education years, the opportunities that are available to young people. They do not have to go down the path of higher education, even though in my state we still have the equivalent of a full house crowd of the MCG as the number of places in HECS funded universities and then some, if that is your choice. But if you are not academically minded, this government has facilitated your making a choice to go down a different career path. So this is very much a budget about those choices.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other issue that is worth dwelling on for a moment is a claim prior to the election that the sums of this measure just do not add up. Well, haven't we proven that incorrect. Not only have we secured the funding by making sure that this government is not relying on the bankcard to fund these sorts of initiatives; we have also taken pressure off interest rates and, as I mentioned earlier, delivered to those people of Dunkley, purchasing their homes, a great savings in their mortgage costs. That is a very admirable way to go. We have done these things for one simple reason: because our children are very important. They are the future of this nation, and we must never lose sight of that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One reason why I am particularly supportive of this bill is that it is putting spending power back in the hands of people who need it most. I very much welcome this family tax initiative, because what we have done is to give families a choice that they can exercise. We have not said to them that we favour one type of family structure or another. What we have done is to facilitate that choice. We have made a decision that the Labor Party just could not quite come at, that is families are best placed to decide how families should be organised.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we have this quadrella for kids. We have support across the board for families. We have kept some of the worthwhile initiatives
         <break page="4762" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that the former government introduced in the child&amp;hyphen;care area. We have taken pressure off interest rates. This is fantastic news for the 32,000 children in Dunkley and their families. They have a chance to be able to cope with the costs and they have a chance to be able to prepare themselves for a better future. Above all, they have the chance of a very secure future, a brighter future because we have a coalition government that understands that families are best placed to manage families, that the choices that families make are made because they take account of their own circumstances. We have put money back in the pockets of those people to facilitate those changes. All of us who believe that families are the most worthwhile institution in our community are beholden to support this bill.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are not actually talking about a measure that favours any particular part of this country. Perhaps those in the inner suburbs in Melbourne where we have fewer kids than Dunkley might think this is something that favours the suburbs, the heartland of people looking for brighter futures out in the electorate of Dunkley. But what has been shown once again is another measure by a government interested in the long term, interested in the future of this country. I commend the bill to the House.

Why didn't the Treasurer, before making that statement, give Senator Harradine the courtesy of a private communication, as both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Communications said publicly would happen?

As a response, section 45E was introduced to prevent it. The Labor Party repealed section 45E because when it comes to access, when it comes to freedom of movement, if the ACTU says, `No,' the Labor Party says, `All right.' If the ACTU says, `We don't want access,' the Labor Party says, `We will agree.' You have got a Labor Party that cravenly took its orders from the ACTU in relation to this matter.

It is a pretty solid poll result just six months after coming into government. For that matter, on the environment—and the Great Barrier Reef is a critical part of Australia's environment and needs very careful policy settings—what was the finding with regard to who is doing best and who will do best on the environment? The coalition was five per cent ahead of the ALP. While I am at it, I was much attracted to the finding on family issues where the poll revealed the coalition is well ahead.

        What the single aviation market does is enables airlines in this country to operate domestic services in New Zealand and vice versa. This is an important micro-economic reform—the winners of which will be the consumers of airline services in Australia and New Zealand. It will do that by creating a more competitive environment for airline services to operate in. It will also provide consumers with more choice and, ultimately, that will result in lower prices as a consequence of the completion of this agreement.

        What it also does, as the honourable member for North Sydney intimated in the question, is repairs the relationship that was so badly damaged by the previous Labor government. At a quarter to midnight in 1994, just a few days before the single aviation market was due to be implemented, the previous government axed that agreement at the last moment, having had two years of negotiation, two years of goodwill—negotiation between two countries that have traditionally had the friendliest and most cooperative of relationships.

        The issue raised is an important one. It goes to the heart of a matter for which the New South Wales state government has primary responsibility. The federal government is absolutely committed to proper process, particularly in terms of establishing our objectives—a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. We have clearly indicated to New South Wales, who have undertaken a lot of preliminary work in this matter, that we expect the process to be undertaken with integrity and with minimum compromise in terms of any early or pre-emptive decisions by the New South Wales government.

         The day before yesterday in this place, I made it quite plain that the government will proceed carefully, taking full and proper account of the social and economic consequences that would flow from locking away large tracts of forest.

         We do seek a cooperative approach. We have been patient. We have put up $60 million for the FISAP program. We do want a proper and balanced outcome. Our commitment to the program is clearly evidenced by the $48 million found to progress the RFAs and by the new regulations for woodchip exports, which will provide certainty and stability for this industry so troubled in recent years by what it got from the other side. Those in the industry are telling us that for the first time in years they feel confident about investing and value adding. That means jobs and prosperity for regional and rural Australia, which you deprived them of. It is a good outcome for industry and it is a good outcome for the environment.

         On that matter, I would like to comment that there do seem to be some problems on the other side in getting their act together.

         That is not the case. That is not what we are doing. It is very interesting to note that just two days before that the shadow minister for resources and energy wrote in a letter to me that it was pointless and unnecessary for the industry to give me an assurance that no extra tree would be felled if we increased the woodchip volumes because `the trees are going to be felled anyway.' There is no agreement and no capacity to get a policy position together there.

        This is because the people in Australia have recognised a government that was prepared to take on the hard issues. They have recognised a government that was prepared not to stand by and say, `Seventy billion dollars of inherited debt over the last five budgets; we cannot do anything about it,' but to stand up and to take the measures to fix it. This is a government which is going to secure the future for Australia, and this is an opposition which is suffering from RDS—relevance deprivation syndrome—which is self-confessed, self-diagnosed and self-inflicted.

I have been assured that single parent families have an enormously low take-up of private health insurance; that any new products that come onto the market would be priced to attract them; and the price of those would be quite independent of any other products—and I certainly will not be allowing or approving increases in family products that were the basis of it because that is contrary to the assurances that I have been given.

        This school has a great commitment to provide vocational education courses for its students. It has done so for some years and has some 170 students participating in various vocational education programs. But what impressed me most about the visit to the school was the tremendous enthusiasm of the principal and the staff of the school for the vocational education initiatives that the government announced in the budget and, in particular, for the tremendous opportunities that are opening up for schools through the school based apprenticeships and part&amp;hyphen;apprenticeships and traineeships which can be located in schools and organised with local small businesses.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The member will be aware, as the staff of the school were aware, that the government has allocated some $187 million in the budget to encourage the development of these programs. As schools around Australia, such as Pine Rivers High, pick up the government's initiatives and run with them, we are going to see an enormous number of opportunities opening up for students who were consistently disadvantaged by the policies of the previous government. That 30 per cent of students who generally do not complete year 12 are going to gain opportunities that they did not receive throughout the entire 13 years of Labor. These were students who were neglected. They are now having programs put in place which will assist them.

        I am pleased to be able to inform the member that, to provide a coordinator to bring the school and the local business community together, an enhancement grant of $49,000 is being provided by the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation. I am aware that the school is also talking with the local branch of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs for funding possibly through another program, the OLMA program, to help unemployed people.

         The fact is that we have here an enormous opportunity for these students, and I congratu late the member on the initiative that he has taken in stimulating the schools in his electorate to take advantage of these. I know that this is shared across the government membership. There is a tremendous commitment across the membership of the government benches to work with their local communities, to work with local small businesses, to work with their local schools to bring communities and schools which have been divided for many years together to take advantage of these initiatives.

One misconception is related to the frequency of supplementary questions being asked. A belief appears to have developed that the chair will allow a supplementary question to be answered on a irregular basis. This became apparent yesterday when five supplementary questions were asked arising from eight initial questions coming from the opposition and the first four supplementary questions were not allowed.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another misconception relates to the purpose of supplementary questions. Standing order 151 indicates that they are to elucidate an answer. On this basis, supplementary questions should arise out of a minister's answer. Thus, I would not expect to allow a supplementary question to a question which, in my opinion, was fully answered. Normally, I would not allow a supplementary question to a minister who had referred the first question to another minister, as a referral of this kind does not constitute an answer.

In doing this the government has from 1 July 1996 extended to all tourist operators the eligibility for promotional expenditure. The minimum expenditure threshold has been lowered from $30,000 to $20,000. By doing this, single service tourist providers are included in the scheme at 50 per cent. The Labor Party previously maintained that at a 25 per cent rate.

        The extension of the use of the EMDG scheme is enormously important to tourist operators throughout Australia. In recognition of the small and the medium sized business operators in Australia, which are predominant within the tourist industry, we have enabled individuals to band together so that they are eligible for the $20,000 that the scheme provides. These are very extensive additions and well worthwhile recalling.

        While I am at it, can I point to some good news that is occurring in the tourist area. Only yesterday a press release was put out by my office in relation to international visitors to Australia. This showed that some 3.7 million visitors came to Australia in 1995, an increase of 11 per cent over the previous year. The expenditure in Australia by international visitors in 1995 totalled some $6.3 billion, and this did not include airfares or prepaid packages. On top of that, it is worth pointing out that international tourism generates export earnings in Australia of something of the order of $14 billion a year, accounting for nearly 13 per cent of total export earnings.

        In regard to the provision of a newspaper clipping service, the portfolio budget statements of the Department of the House of Representatives make it clear that the department's funding situation is extremely tight, with little scope to absorb any additional expenditure requirements. I have, however, asked that the department examine the scope for providing this service within the existing funding allocation for members' services. The examination will include the scope for use of the existing Senate arrangements which, I am advised, cost in the vicinity of $40,000 for the press clipping contract and in-house printing.

         —As I said, I rise on a matter of national importance after reports that our Prime Minister in Japan has been called upon by the Japanese government and by senior figures in Japanese industry to give some kind of assurance that Australia will be able to deliver on its export commitments, on contractual commitments undertaken by Australian companies to deliver resources to Japan. The Prime Minister has been called upon to give that assurance after repeated failures of Australians to be able to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          deliver on those commitments as a result of industrial action and as a result of increasing pressure from some of our competitors, such as Canada, who are giving promises of a capacity to deliver on a much more secure basis.

        The wording of this matter of public importance has been done quite deliberately. I want to make it clear that we on this side of the House have no beef with the vast bulk of the working people of Australia. These are the people who long ago jettisoned the rhetoric of class hatred, which so frequently spews forth from the other side of this chamber. These are the people who want to get on with the job, who want to make Australia more productive and who are embracing workplace and enterprise agreements with relish. These are the people whom this government, more so than any other group in this chamber, represents.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If there is any doubt about that whatsoever, I would urge members on the other side of the House simply to open their eyes. Do not take my word for it. If you want to know who represents the working people of Australia, ask who sits in the seats of Hughes, of Robertson, of Lowe, of Eden&amp;hyphen;Monaro, of Paterson, of Richmond, of Macarthur and of Gilmore? I can tell you that we did not get here on the votes of the Melbourne Club. You should ask who represents McMillan, Bendigo and Chisholm. We represent those hundreds of thousands of working Australians who have haemorrhaged out of the trade union movement and have come flooding over to this side of the House. They see us as being more representative of their hopes, of their interests and of their attitudes.

        If we go to the seeds of the present discontent, the seeds of the industrial problems in the resources sector of this country, we need go no further than that venerable figure of the trade union movement: Bill Kelty. This was the great leader who, at the height of our difficulties in resolving a complex dispute at Weipa, wrote to the purchasers of Australian resources and told them not to purchase from Australian supplier CRA.

        It would be bad enough if this were an aberration. It would be bad enough if this were a departure from the strategy. The thing we have to recognise is that this was a natural and logical outcome of the statement made by Kelty on 21 February.

        So then at that moment, whilst scenes of violence and vandalism are going out across the world on CNN, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has his first real test of leadership. He steps up to the podium as people's lives are seriously being threatened. Real leadership is the capacity to take on your own constituency on a matter of principle and that was the challenge that the Leader of the Opposition was faced with at that moment.

        So what did he do? What words of statesmanship came forth from his lips? What moderation proceeded to calm the rioting crowd? `This government hates workers'—that is the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition. `This government hates women in the work force'—thanks very much, smash, bang, crash, vandalism. `This government hates Aborigines'—so then the violence takes place and the whole thing is out of control. Labor ever since has been in this schizophrenic dance backwards and forwards trying to work out what its relationship is with the perpetrators of this violence.

         Tony Eggleston, a former organiser with the furniture division of the CFMEU, said he was told by the union's national secretary, Lou Kyriacou, to start a campaign of harassment against employers in the furniture industry.

         I first came across the CFMEU in the electorate of Parramatta when I went to the area consultative committees and said, `Tell me the problems that you have had getting young people in Parramatta into jobs.' They said, `One of the biggest problems we face is the unions.' They said, `We got those initiating the M2 motorway project'—a $600 million project in the north of Parramatta—`to agree to employ 60 young Australians in the construction industry. With the Olympics coming up, we needed more construction workers.' They were right about to sign the deal when they got a call from none other than Andrew Ferguson. Andrew rolls in and explained to Abigroup Obayashi, the proponents, that if they dare employ these 60 young Australians the CFMEU will bring the project to its knees. This is the commitment of the ACTU to new employment in this country.

        This bill amends four bounty acts to achieve savings announced by the government in the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget. The savings are to be achieved by the termination of the computers bounty with effect from 1 July 1997 and the books, machine tools and robots and ships bounties with effect from 20 August 1996.

         The government is abolishing these bounty schemes as they have run their course and are no longer considered to be an appropriate or cost effective means of industry assistance. Recent Industry Commission reports have recommended that each of the bounty schemes be allowed to lapse on their scheduled statutory termination dates. The govern ment has decided to terminate the schemes ahead of their scheduled dates—nine months early for the ships and machine tools and robots bounties, 15 months for the books bounty and 3&amp;half; years for the computers bounty—because of the overriding objective to eliminate the budget deficit.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As the bounties are being paid at declining rates of support, in line with the reduction of general tariff levels, their impact on industry development objectives is declining in importance. The declining rates of assistance also mean that an ever increasing percentage of the total cost to the Commonwealth of each of these bounties is represented by administration and compliance costs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will now turn to considerations in respect of each of the affected bounties which the government took into account in making the decision to bring them to an early end.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The decision to abolish the computers bounty was made because, in the government's view, there are more important factors than the bounty in determining the continuing profitability of Australia's information technology and telecommunications industries.

         (Quorum formed)
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These factors include the fundamentals of Australia's broad economic environment, the sophistication of the Australian market place and the enormous opportunities for trade in information technology and telecommunications products and services within our region. Therefore, considering the government's need to address the budget deficit problem, it is not possible to maintain the computers bounty.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Moreover, I should note that following the budget announcement concerning the cessation of the computers bounty, the government has honoured its commitment to convene an Information Industries Taskforce. The taskforce, the membership of which has largely been drawn from industry, has been asked to provide advice on any alternative measures that might be pursued to ensure that the information industries are able to take advantage of emerging opportunities. In particular, in the light of the termination of the computers bounty from 30 June 1997, the taskforce has been asked to consider whether, and in what form, the information technology
        <break page="4792" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         and telecommunications industries might require industry assistance from that date.

        Bounty assistance for the production of books has been in place since 1969 with the current scheme operating since 1987. The bounty was introduced to offset duties on manufacturing inputs and to enable printing companies to remain internationally competitive. The rate of bounty has declined from 20 per cent in 1987 to its current level of 7.2 per cent and is due to phase to 4.5 per cent on 1 January 1997.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Industry Commission is currently reviewing assistance for book production. In its draft report, released prior to the budget, the commission recommended abolition of the books bounty when the current scheme expires on 31 December 1997. It noted that industry has improved efficiency despite reducing levels of assistance and this would be expected to continue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The machine tools and robots bounty scheme, which has been in place since 1 July 1985, was also the subject of a recent Industry Commission inquiry. The commission found that the scheme could not be considered a success as it had not effectively promoted production of metal working machines nor the development of machinery for working advanced materials. It also found that the scheme had not been a significant stimulus to the export of machine tools and robotics, nor had it been effective in encouraging Australian industry to invest in advanced technology machinery. The commission recommended that the scheme be allowed to lapse on 30 June 1997.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government's decision to terminate the books and machine tools and robots bounties from 20 August 1996 merely speeds up the process recommended by the Industry Commission and yields additional savings to help balance the budget.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To minimise disruption to industry, the bill includes transitional arrangements for these two bounties. The amendments will allow bounty to be paid on bountiable books and equipment already in production on budget night, or the subject of certain contracts entered into before budget night, provided that production is completed by 20 February 1997.

         The Australian shipbuilding industry has established itself as a world leader in the construction of small to medium lightweight vessels. The innovative use of technology and advanced materials by the Australian shipbuilders has meant a growing market for fast ferries, which are in operation in many countries providing new services as well as replacing the more traditional ferries. The economies of travel time savings have provided the stimulus for ferry operators to buy Australian built fast ferries. The Australian industry's share of the world fast ferry market has ranged from 25 per cent to 30 per cent in recent years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The success of the shipbuilding industry was reported on by the Bureau of Industry Economics, BIE, in its March 1995 report reviewing the ships bounty. One of the recommendations of that report was that it was now time to consider the termination of direct bounty assistance as the industry was now at a stage where it could compete in the world economy without the need for such assistance. The government has therefore decided, as a budget measure, to discontinue this bounty. However, it has also recognised that there was a need for transitional arrangements which would reduce the impact of the termination on shipbuilders.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To this end the current amendments allow for vessels under construction on budget night and for those under pre&amp;hyphen;budget night contracts but yet to be commenced, to receive bounty as long as those vessels are completed by 30 June 1997, when the bounty is currently due to terminate. Customs will be monitoring the needs of shipbuilders during the transition phase to ensure that the transition from an assisted to a fully competitive environment is achieved in an orderly manner.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendments in the bill are expected to result in savings of $8.5 million in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 and $14.8 million in 1997&amp;hyphen;98 in respect of the books, machine tools and robots and ships bounties and $20 million in 1997&amp;hyphen;98, $44.7 million in 1998&amp;hyphen;99, $46.4 million in 1999&amp;hyphen;2000 and $31.2 million thereafter in respect of the computers bounty. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

        The bill will put in place the necessary framework to give effect to the government's decision to sell Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, and its subsidiaries. CFM is a wholly Commonwealth owned public company that provides investment services in the public and private sectors. Its major clients are the Boards of Trustees of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation scheme. However, it acts as a wholesale funds manager for a number of other public and private sector funds and is involved in retail funds management for individual investors via its superannuation and general investment retail products.

        CFM was created in 1991 by the transformation of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. SFIT had been established in 1976 as a statutory authority with trustee responsibility for the management and investment of the CSS fund which contained the contributions of CSS members and the income earned from the investment of those contributions.

        When the new PSS scheme was established in 1990, full responsibility for that scheme and the investment of PSS fund moneys was given to the joint employer&amp;hyphen;employee PSS board.

        The transfer of SFIT's trustee function and responsibility for the investment of the CSS fund to the CSS board, was accompanied by SFIT's transformation to CFM with the role of general funds manager. To assist its establishment as a funds manager, CFM was provided with legislative monopolies over the management of the CSS and PSS funds until 30 June 1995. Since then, the CSS and PSS boards have been free to determine their own investment management arrangements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        During the period of its monopoly, CFM worked with the CSS and PSS boards to develop investment management arrangements to apply to the CSS and PSS funds after 30 June 1995. The new arrangements involve CFM's subsidiary, Total Risk Management Pty Ltd (TRM), in providing advice to the boards about the overall investment strategies for the funds. The strategies involve management of substantial `passive' cores of the funds. This is being undertaken by CFM. The balance of the CSS and PSS funds has been progressively allocated by the CSS and PSS boards to a number of specialist `active' funds managers who have been selected on the advice of TRM.

        Although CFM has developed additional business and attracted funds from other clients, the substantial CSS and PSS funds under management still represented some 75 per cent of the total funds under CFM's direct management as at 30 June 1996. The ending of the monopolies over the CSS and PSS funds has renewed pressures on CFM to improve its competitiveness in attracting additional clients and additional funds under management. This has come at a time when competition in the funds management industry itself has been increasing.

        Moreover, the growing numbers of competitors provide opportunities for CFM. Many of those competitors are facing similar pressures and it is expected that some would be interested in joining forces via a purchase of CFM. It is expected that CFM's expertise and experience will be of benefit to potential purchasers and in turn that CFM would benefit from the wider opportunities available for further—

        The government's decision to sell CFM is consistent with the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit (NCOA) which considered that government business activities whose objectives are to provide goods and services on a commercial basis should only be retained in public ownership if there is a clear public interest case to do so. Against the background of a growing number and variety of funds managers, and the investment strategies of the CSS and PSS boards, there is clearly no public interest case to retain CFM in public ownership.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In reaching its decision, the government consulted with the board of CFM which has fully supported this initiative. The sale process is also being undertaken in close consultation with CFM and CFM's major clients, particularly the CSS and PSS boards of

        The CFM Sale Bill provides the necessary framework to give effect to the decision to sell CFM. The bill provides for a flexible disposal strategy. It allows for the sale of the shares in CFM and the separate sale of the shares in CFM subsidiaries on the same or different days. It enables the establishment, under ministerial direction, of subsidiaries of CFM and the transfer of subsidiaries to Commonwealth ownership to allow their separate sale.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Part 2 of the bill provides for the transfer of CFM subsidiaries to the Commonwealth. In particular, it enables the transfer of CFM's existing subsidiary, TRM, to Commonwealth ownership to facilitate sale of that company separately from the sale of CFM, if sale in that form eventuates from the tender process now under way. That approach was recommended in the scoping study prepared by the business advisers appointed by my department.

        That part of the bill also includes provision for the transfer of CFM staff, by ministerial declaration, to a CFM subsidiary which has been transferred under this bill. This is because at present all the staff employed in CFM's operations, including those of the subsidiary TRM, are employed by CFM. The bill provides for continuity of employment terms and conditions and accrued entitlements for CFM staff who are transferred to TRM or any other CFM subsidiary that may be created. Provision is also made for the application of certain parts of the Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Act, and certain other legislation to transferred CFM subsidiaries.

         Part 3 of the bill provides for the declaration of the sale day for CFM and any transferred bodies by the minister. Importantly, the bill provides in part 3 for the preservation or other recognition of entitlements of CFM staff. It preserves accrued long service leave and superannuation entitlements and ensures that the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensa tion Act continues to apply in relation to injury or loss incurred before sale day.

        The bill provides for certain other rights, such as mobility rights under the Public Service Act 1922, to cease when CFM or a transferred body is sold. In these respects the bill reflects the past practice of government in protecting accrued rights of employees in asset sale situations. The bill also provides in part 3 for the cancellation of CFM's franking credits, as the government's clear advice has been that there would be no benefit to the sale process in having those credits pass to any purchaser.

        Part 4 of the bill further provides for the transfer, by ministerial declaration, of specified assets, liabilities, rights and obligations of CFM or a transferred body to specified transferees on specified days. The ability to transfer these matters in this way will allow for the sale or transfer of matters that do not constitute CFM subsidiaries and for which it would not be appropriate to establish a subsidiary. This includes the transfer of assets and liabilities to transferred bodies to enable them to be sold as separate commercial entities.

        The bill amends the Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Act 1990 to remove the constraints on the sale of CFM included in section 47 of that act and provides for the removal of similar constraints from CFM's memorandum and articles of association. The bill applies relevant provisions of that act to CFM subsidiaries that are transferred to Commonwealth ownership while they are in Commonwealth ownership and provides that they will cease to apply to CFM and the transferred bodies when they are sold. The bill also makes consequential amendments to a number of other Commonwealth acts.

        This bill will provide a framework for the sale of CFM in the most flexible and expeditious way in response to commercial interest that is expressed in the sale process.

        The bill provides for this government's program of assistance to the states and territories for government and non&amp;hyphen;government schools for the 1997&amp;hyphen;2000 quadrennium.

        The bill fulfils the government's commitments to promote excellence and achievement through the provision of quality education and prepare our young people for an active and productive life both in the work force and as participating citizens in the community and global economy.

        The main theme of the bill is the importance of choice in providing for improved educational outcomes for Australian students. The bill further supports the devolution of decision making about education to parents and communities to ensure that education is responsive to student needs. The bill will provide choice for better options for the future.

        This bill provides for significant reform in the emphasis, availability and administration of the Commonwealth's schools programs. To support these changes, the bill will appropriate in excess of $14 billion for the coming quadrennium under a rationalised set of programs which this government believes best
        <break page="4796" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        The major part of this funding will continue to be directed to the general recurrent and capital grants programs. The government has, however, decided to replace a complex array of more than 40 school related programs of targeted assistance by a streamlined set of five programs; namely, literacy; languages; and special learning needs, which are included in the bill before us; and two other programs school to work; and quality outcomes, the funding for which is included in other legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A strong determination to secure the foundations of effective learning is behind the government's policy of ensuring that all students are provided with literacy and numeracy skills. Illiteracy is the worst form of poverty and a blight on society. The government's literacy program of more than $150 million annually is one of the government's most important equity programs. The literacy program subsumes the general support element of the English as a second language program and the disadvantaged schools program. It will also replace the early literacy program which was due to end in 1996.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Funding is to be provided under the literacy program for a new national literacy and numeracy strategy directed at improving the literacy and numeracy skills of school leavers. The bill will appropriate some $45 million for this purpose for the next three years. Many young people, especially those who are educationally disadvantaged, leave school without the literacy and numeracy skills essential for further study or sustained employment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Two factors will ensure the strategy's relevance to the problems being faced by young people. First, it will draw upon the results of the national schools English literacy survey which are scheduled to be released early next year. Secondly, it will identify best classroom practice.

        —While the languages program is directed at the teaching of a wide range of languages other than English, it gives particular emphasis to Asian languages and cultural studies. Clearly, it is important to the development of Australia's trade relations for businesses in this country to have leaders and staff who are proficient in Asian languages and who have an understanding of Asian cultures.

       The special learning needs program, which is the third priority initiative, includes funding for three tightly targeted areas addressing the needs of clearly identified clients. These areas are: special education for students with disabilities; provision of intensive English language instruction for newly arrived migrants; and provision of supplementary
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        educational services for students in country areas.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The bill contains some $636 million over four years for the special learning needs program. The program will have as its objective the full participation in schooling of students with specific educational needs and the subsequent realisation of their maximum potential in the work force.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Returning to the theme of choice, the broadbanding effected by this bill, which has brought together a number of related programs, will give schools a degree of flexibility in determining their priorities which they have never had before. Schools will be able to respond to the changing needs of students and direct their resources to achieving the best possible learning outcomes for their students.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In addition to the literacy, languages and special needs programs, which are directed at particular needs in the school community, the bill also provides in excess of $11 billion for general recurrent grants and some $1.2 billion for capital grants, including an additional $30 million for non&amp;hyphen;government schools capital grants.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The fourth priority initiative, which I mentioned earlier, and for which funds will be included in other legislation, is the school to work program. This program is intended to make the transition from school to work a natural and successful process for all students.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The final initiative, which will be covered by the appropriation bills, is the quality outcomes program. This initiative unites a number of programs directed at teacher development—the civics and citizenship program and the projects of national significance program. The unified program will provide a sharper focus on the achievement of quality outcomes in schooling while giving recognition to the fact that teachers play a key role in the academic and social development of children. It is vital that teachers have access to quality and regular professional development opportunities to enhance their expertise and professionalism, and the programs contained in the bill will allow for that to occur.

        Emphasising the theme of choice, this bill legislates a new and more equitable policy for non-government schools seeking Commonwealth funding. This policy replaces the attempts of the previous government to impose a bureaucratic, unfair and inequitable burden on non&amp;hyphen;government schools seeking Commonwealth funding. The application process under the previous government's new schools policy was bound in red tape, as was the process for reviewing the funding category of those schools already in receipt of funding.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Furthermore, the Labor government's new schools policy confined non-government schools approved for funding since May 1988 to a maximum funding level of category 6. This arbitrary restriction has jeopardised the existence of many deserving schools worthy of a higher level of support from governments. It also restricted parental choice in non-government schooling for their children, especially for low income families.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This government's policy for newly commencing schools will make a school's entitlement to Commonwealth funding primarily dependent upon state or territory government recognition. There will, of course, be a requirement that schools be run by an incorporated body, be non&amp;hyphen;profit making and enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth. Non&amp;hyphen;government school funding will, however, be both simple and equitable. This is a most important measure.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government believes that parents should have the choice between schools in both the government and non&amp;hyphen;government sectors and between schools in each sector. The government has no preconceived ideas about the size of either sector. It is important that Australia has a strong government school sector and a strong non&amp;hyphen;government school sector.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The cost to the Commonwealth of a student attending a non&amp;hyphen;government school is more than the cost of a student attending a government school. Conversely, the cost to a state or territory of a student attending a government school is more than the cost of a student attending a non&amp;hyphen;government school.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This, coupled with the fact that the proportion of students in non&amp;hyphen;government schools
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         has increased from 24.4 per cent in 1983 to 29 per cent in 1995, has meant that states and territories have had the potential to cost shift and save on the education of students in government schools. Against this background, the government has decided to preserve for the Commonwealth 50 per cent of net recurrent savings to a state or territory from students shifting from the government to the non&amp;hyphen;government sector.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Grants to the states and territories for government schools will reflect the choices of parents between government and non&amp;hyphen;government schools. This decision is to be effective from January 1997 and operate at least for the 1997&amp;hyphen;2000 quadrennial program for schools.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many of the provisions of the bill are familiar, as they also appeared in the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992. Those provisions have been placed in a more rational structure. This is a reflection of the grouping of some of the previous programs into the five priority initiatives I referred to earlier. It also reflects efforts to reduce the amount of repetition prevalent in the previous act.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For the first time, the bill contains provisions to ensure comprehensive reporting on the application of financial assistance provided to schools. This will be achieved through a strengthened national report on schooling in Australia with a range of core data showing what our students are learning and where the greatest needs lie. This information will be a key factor in the Commonwealth's future policy responses in the area of schooling.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill provides the bulk of a five per cent increase in total Commonwealth funding for schools. In financial year terms, this means an increase from $3.3 billion in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 to $3.4 billion in 1996&amp;hyphen;97. This demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring that Australia's young people gain the best possible education opportunities to make the most of their future.

I indicated, as was my opinion then, that there would be a commitment of a fixed sum to drug strategies out of the residue of the confiscated assets trust fund. This is, in fact, not correct. The commitment of a fixed sum will be out of the consolidated revenue fund. The funding of drug strategies will now be by way of appropriation from consolidated revenue, which in turn will receive the residue from the fund in any given year. This will enable funding of drug strategies in a planned and predictable way.

         in tax cuts but Australians were subjected to $13.4 billion in new taxes. When the 1993&amp;hyphen;94 budget was brought down, some of the highlights were: an increase in wholesale sales tax by two per cent, from 20 to 22 per cent, obviously impacting directly upon many Australian families and many of the goods that they purchase; an increase in petrol tax of 7c and 5c on leaded and unleaded petrol respectively, another major impost on average Australian families; an increase in the excise on tobacco of 15 per cent; the taxation as normal income of lump sum payments for unused annual leave and long service leave; the imposition of FBT on salary package benefits such as membership of social clubs; a tightening of the safety net for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme—and haven't we heard a lot about that in this session of the parliament; restricted access to Medicare benefits for optometry services; a reduction in the growth of defence spending; and the pushing of the pension age for women to 65 over a 20&amp;hyphen;year period.

        The 1993&amp;hyphen;94 budget changed Austudy and changed HECS repayments to commence earlier and at higher rates. Yet Labor complains when we make similar changes to HECS in a responsible budget. Labor realigned HECS with income tax arrangements, so payments reflected the proportion of the year for which those with HECS obligations earned above the repayment threshold. That was in 1994&amp;hyphen;95. It increased departure tax to $27 and increased recovery costs of aviation safety standards.

The point that I make here is that, whether we are talking about HECS, pharmaceuticals or aged care, whatever we are talking about, the 1993&amp;hyphen;94, 1994&amp;hyphen;95 and 1995&amp;hyphen;96 Keating budgets attacked many of these areas. Labor increased taxes, it increased the burden, and yet the opposition stands up in this parliament and derides this government for the position that it takes. The big difference is this: I would have had no problem with the raising of taxes that Labor undertook if it had been going to result in some improvement to the Australian overall economy. But it did not do that. The previous government simply spent more money. When you spend more money, at the end of the day you do not improve Australia's fiscal position, you do not improve the outlook for the generations to come.

Eighty offices are going to be closed. You would say that that is an appalling thing to happen but the reality of the situation is that the closing of 80 Medicare offices means that we are going to be able to open 400 Medicare agencies in regional areas and in outer suburbs such as in Narangba in my electorate.

         In those areas young families have only one car and the breadwinner usually uses that car. Therefore, they cannot access many of the facilities that other people enjoy in central city areas. They will be able now to have a Medicare agency in their region. The people on Bribie Island where we have very much an elderly population, about 15,000 people, are going to be able to access a Medicare agency now. I also hope that we are going to be able to have them in places such as Laidley and Esk. They are only 100 kilometres from the Brisbane GPO but the bottom line is that they may as well be at the back of Bourke for the amount of service that they received under the previous Labor government.

        Because this is the budget debate we really do need to say a few things about what is going to happen as a result of the new direction of the new government. Firstly, it is true that this government has set some targets. It has set targets for inflation at around two per cent. In fact, it has exchanged letters between the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the new governor of the Reserve Bank to ensure that the governor is fully aware of what the government desires in relation to inflation. I have to say that having a low inflationary outcome is a good thing and it really would be supported by members on this side of the chamber.

         —I think you have to understand that there is a difference between the Howard government and the previous government in relation to inflation. We also said that we thought it was a very high priority to have employment increasing. We were very optimistic and desirous of having a very strong growth rate. It is interesting that the government is prepared to set targets for inflation and set targets about getting into a surplus as far as the budget is concerned—and we would support the general thrust of that. We do not agree with what they
         <break page="4808" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          are doing; we do not agree when you hack and slash programs and say you are going to put that to getting the budget into surplus. We think getting the budget into surplus is a good thing.

        But I want to return to inflation, because you pay a price when you abandon an employment target. You pay a price—and the price is that if you crunch down on inflation, as this government wants to, you are going to see unemployment increase. The budget papers talk about unemployment rising through the year to 8.5 per cent. You would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that figure has already been exceeded. While the growth target in the budget is 3.5 per cent, I really regret to say that I do not think it is going to be met. Already, people are talking about nine per cent through to the year 2000—and even higher. I think you can guarantee one thing about this budget: the growth target will not be met and the unemployment target will be exceeded. That is a tragedy for ordinary Australians, because even if you are in a job you will know people who do not have one or know the despair of not being able to find a job.

       <para first-indent="16">
        On the Labor side, we always felt you needed to put people first, that the best form of economy is a strong economy and sustained growth. I would like to see growth even greater than we were able to achieve under the most difficult circumstances. I just want to put that on the record. And I ask the people of Lindsay, for example, who will have an opportunity to vote, to note that the government will put a target on inflation, a target on growth, but they will not put a target on how they expect unemployment to fall—because they know they cannot achieve it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We went to the last election—people such as the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) and our new colleague the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield)—proud of the fact that, as a government, we were setting a target up there. We were saying we believed that as Australia, the society we know and love, goes into the new millennium we had to pick the lowest possible level of unemployment. We said, `At every election we have said we would create a certain number of jobs—and we have exceeded that.' When people on the then government side, on the Labor side, set the figure of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000, firstly we were proud of it and, secondly, we knew that on our track record we would meet that target.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But on the government side today they will not tell the people of Australia what they believe. They do not even believe that they should have a target. In other words, compared to inflation, compared to the budget position—whether it is in surplus or deficit—unemployment is not a sufficiently important statistic for the government to pin its name and reputation on. The second reason for that is that they know all their policies are not going to add up to decreasing unemployment but to increasing it. In this respect, they have sadly deceived the people of Australia. I hope that in the by&amp;hyphen;election in Lindsay we will get an opportunity to revisit this with the people, because they are good people in Lindsay, my neighbouring seat. They are hard working, industrious, family oriented and, let me say, very concerned about unemployment. Let's see how concerned they are.

The children are going to be our future and they are to be nurtured and treated and valued and encouraged. But our senior citizens are the people that have already made their contribution, doing so before my generation. They have done something to develop and make Australia the country it is. It is not that they are not intrinsically nice people; they are. They are lovely and courteous; they give me great support. But they have made a contribution to Australia which I am always happy to acknowledge in terms of what they are leaving me and others. That is why I find what the government is doing about nursing homes so outrageous.

        The government is going to raise $130 million out of this down payment on death by senior citizens. The minister says, `It is not up to us. Nursing homes are going to make the assessment about whether they are going to charge $26,000'—and I believe it is going to be closer to $50,000. The minister says that it is not up to the government; it is up to the nursing homes. It may be the case that some of the religious nursing homes are going to take a very compassionate view of it. Under the funding for hostels, they have to set aside a certain percentage for people who cannot pay an up&amp;hyphen;front fee. But this is not the case with this new nursing home imposition. It is going to be left to the people who run it.

        Can we say to this government, which is obsessed with bottom lines, profits and private enterprise, that the wealthy Australians who are so well connected to it and who own and operate private nursing homes are suddenly going to say, `If it is a choice between collecting $26,000 or $30,000'—or whatever the figure that the minister cannot provide is, which we know is at least $26,000—`or not we don't want your money, madam. We are going to freely elect to drop our bottom line. We are not really operating under the profit motive, even though we may be listed or incorporated as a company.

        The government is doing a number of things to poor, elderly, frail, vulnerable Australians. Firstly, it is saying that if they cannot afford the $26,000 they cannot get into a nursing home, even though they are in a housing commission flat and are medically assessed as requiring a nursing home bed. So their quality of life is going to suffer. When you are medically assessed as requiring nursing home accommodation, you require it. So your quality of life, your medical condition, is going to suffer. This is the destiny for poor, elderly, frail Australians. This is the government's vision of the future.

        I know a lot of senior citizens who are on a pension and are living in their homes. The government says, `No&amp;hyphen;one is going to be forced to sell their home.' I will give you an example. This is a true story. There is a couple in my electorate and the husband required heart surgery. They were referred to a cardiologist. They owned some acreage, but were pensioners. They are lovely people. The cardiologist said to them, `Why do you need to live in your home? Why don't you sell this home and land and pay for the operation?' That is the double jeopardy you are going to be putting people in.

        One tenth of this nation's entire export earnings throughout its history has come from wool. In 1988, one&amp;hyphen;tenth of this nation's export earnings came from a single commodity, wool. The last thing that any government should have done was to play around with wool, but
        <break page="4812" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         government did. The net result of it was that when the economic rationalists took us into the paradise of enlightenment that we are now in the world's wool buyers were able to buy our wool for $3,000 million a year, instead of $6,000 million a year.

        On behalf of the world's wool buyers and wool traders, I would like to say thank you to the Australian people for selling a product at around half of its cost of production to us for the last six years. The people that enabled them to do that were the economic rationalists, the people who are the architects of the misery in this country, and they are still riding high in all parts of government.

        I will move on. The second decision was to deregulate the banking sector. Let me go to no lesser authority than Trevor Sykes and his book
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        </emphasis>
        . He designates that, in four short years, there was a loss of $28,000 million. In that book—that brilliant tour de force, giving an understanding of what happened in the 1980s in Australia—Trevor Sykes delineated the cause of the loss of that $28,000 million. That is a lot of money. That is costing this country, to this day, $3,000 million a year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So there were two decisions which cost this country $6,000 million a year. The third decision—for which we must thank, as with all three of these decisions, our economic rationalist friends—was the deregulation of the oil industry. As one person put it to me yesterday, it is like the invisible suit of clothes in this place. Outsiders with any sense say, `What is going on here? This economic rationalism is madness.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We deregulated 90 per cent of the oil industry in this country. Having proved how successful it was, now we are going to deregulate the other 10 per cent of it. That will indicate the enlightenment that we have in this place. Since the time we deregulated it, the world's price for oil has dropped clean in half, from $34 a barrel down to about $17 or $18 a barrel. But in Australia the price paid to the oil companies in the same period of time doubled.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        People say to me, `That is ridiculous. Where did you get those figures from?' I thought everyone knew that the world price of oil had dropped clean in half. But, of course, they think it is all taxation. When they go and fill up at the bowser they know that the price they pay has far more than doubled but they think that it is all taxation. Whilst a lot of it is taxation, the fact is that the price paid to the oil companies rose from 12&amp;half; cents a litre to 22 cents a litre in that same period of time. So, while the world price dropped almost clean in half, the Australian price doubled.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That means that the oil companies are taking from the people of Australia $6,000 million a year that they are not entitled to—they are not entitled to one cent of that—because of the slackness in our antimonopolistic legislation  and our lack of determination to enforce that legislation in this country. If you take all the taxes off here, we are looking at something around 36 cents a litre. In the United States, the last time I looked, it was 26 cents a litre. They have adequate antimonopoly legislation which they enforce.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is the background to this budget. If you doubt the extent of the damage that economic rationalists have done to this country, I will quote you some figures. Let us look at average weekly earnings in this country over the last 13 years, under the great hammer of economic rationalism, Mr Keating. I do not doubt for a moment that he has many enthusiastic supporters on our side of the House, so I am not going to stand here and be hypocritical enough to say that it is not the same on our side of the House. These people just seem to keep going with policies without ever assessing whether they work or not.

         If you get my speeches from the state parliament, you will find that I was a very strong economic rationalist 15 years ago. You will get a lot of speeches along these lines from me. But I kept watching the figures. I had to say to myself, `This policy is not working.' I then had to put my tail between my legs and run, because I was monitoring what was happening out there and what were the results of these decisions. The results of these decisions were absolutely disastrous for this country—the three costing $12,000 million a year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As for average weekly earnings, let me quote the figures and be very specific. In 1983, 61.6 was the CPI index. In 1995, it was 117.6. There was a rise in the CPI of 56 per cent between 1983 and 1995. Average weekly earnings in the same period rose from $341 to $654 and that gave us a rise in average weekly earnings of 47.9 per cent. So average weekly earnings trailed the cost of living by 8.1 per cent. Every person who was on an income in this country was down 8.1 per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But that was only a small part of the story. Federal, state and local taxes rose from $52,000 million per year to $151,000 million per year in the same period. Since one&amp;hyphen;third of all our income goes on taxes, that translates into a reduction of 17.7 per cent in take&amp;hyphen;home pay for the average wage&amp;hyphen;earner. The average wage&amp;hyphen;earner in Australia has suffered a loss in his purchasing power of 26 per cent in the last 13 years under these policies.

On present trends, the final quarter almost certainly will go over the 16,780 bankruptcies of three years ago. It is the worst year for Australian business in Australian history.

If you would like to go to the past chairman of the Labor economics caucus committee, John Langmore, he says it is 16.5 per cent. Dr John Quiggin, who won the Academy of Science prize in the year before last, quotes the figure as being between 16.5 and 17.5 per cent.

In 1972, the value of the Australian dollar was such that it took a whopping great $US1.28 to buy an Australian dollar. In 1991, the value of the Australian dollar was $US0.76, or ¥384; and it is now ¥95. In 1972, interest rates stood at 7.7 per cent and, in 1991, at 15.5 per cent.

          How do we get out of the hole that we are in at the present moment? Believe me, we are in a depression. The only reason we do not know that is because we now pay adequate social security payments, which we did not pay during the 1930s. How do we get out of that hole? In fairness to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and to the government, it is very hard to keep borrowing money. Three years ago, the interest paid by the federal government was $3,880 million. The interest paid in 1996 was $9,390 million. If the interest bill keeps exploding at that rate, all of our taxation in a 10&amp;hyphen;year time frame most certainly will go to paying interest just on the federal government's debt.

          So how do we solve this conundrum? To break the cycle, we have to look at adequate anti&amp;hyphen;monopoly laws. We must look at giving our commodity producers, be they wool producers or copper producers or whatever, the ability to collectively market their product. Unless they can collectively market their product, then the little sheep cocky outside of Longreach is being pitted against the might of Itoh of Japan, one of the biggest trading houses in the world.

           as well, because half of our sheep herd—this nation's greatest asset—has already gone.

That is what we did when we abolished the minimum price scheme in wool. There are many other examples I could use. Three thousand million dollars a year is the benefit in wool alone.

That would save this country $6,000 million. Just with those two commodities—wool and petrol—this country could save $9,000 million a year if we had a bit of backbone and aggression and took the same aggressive policies that were taken in the days of people like John McEwen and Sir Robert Menzies.

          To move on, there are some three or, arguably, six major water schemes in Australia which, if we proceed with them, as the Americans did during the Great Depression, will bring into this country $5,000 million a year. I have not got time to go into much detail here. As far as mining goes, if the laws with respect to the Native Title Act are put into place properly and if we stand up to the ridiculous obsession which some people have with the environment and which takes us into absolute lunacy areas, then we will produce for this country great wealth that is not being produced at the present moment. In just six mines in North Queensland and at the top of Western Australia there is $5,000 million worth of production being held up, some of it indefinitely, because of those twin problems that exist in Australia today.

          In the prawn farming industry, the greenies are winning to such an extent that prawn farming is actually going down—production is actually going down in this country—because they are succeeding in closing more farms than we can open. So a tiny little country like Thailand, with a coastline about one&amp;hyphen;twentieth the size of Queensland's coastline or maybe even less than that, is producing $2.2 thousand million worth of prawns a year, whereas Australia is producing from her prawn farms under $100 million a year. And that figure, in all probability at the present moment, is falling. So there is $2,000 million in prawn farming alone to add to that list. Moreover, in the area of ethanol phosphate and converting a lot of our transportation systems to electricity there is another $2,000 million that this country can make but is not making at the present moment.

         —The member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) has just delivered a first&amp;hyphen;class speech on behalf of his constituents. He would make a good Independent member, as a matter of fact. What I want to say at the beginning of my speech relates to the fact that we are debating the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1996&amp;hyphen;97, a very important bill, here in the Main Committee, which was set up—as I well know, being a former member of the Procedures Committee at the time—to deal with non&amp;hyphen;contentious legislation. Here we are in the Main Committee, out of the main chamber, debating what is, effectively, the most important legislation of the year, and the government considers this to be part and parcel of a responsible working parliamentary democracy. I can say that that was outside the scope of the intent of the formation of the Main Committee, well outside.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This was designed to deal with non&amp;hyphen;contentious legislation and it was designed to offer members the opportunity of speaking on those non&amp;hyphen;contentious bills for which, often, the speaking time had concertinaed because of more pressing government matters on the government legislative calendar. We find ourselves now here in this room debating, in effect in the secondary chamber of the House of Representatives, the most important piece of legislation the government has this year. In my view, this is an abrogation of the responsibility of the government. The government made it clear in the election campaign that it was going to raise the standards of parliamentary debate. It was going to improve the way in which we conducted our affairs. It was going to make the Speaker more independent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What we have, in effect, is the executive leaning on the House of Representatives and forcing the legislation which is, basically, going to fund a large amount of the government's election promises—and some of the things it did not promise in the election, which I am going to come to—to be debated here, away from the main stage in the main chamber. That is not only a shame; it is a disgrace. I have made that point clear elsewhere and I will continue to do so until the government realises that people in the wider community will not put up with this. Then it will have to change. The government, in essence, is using the power of its numbers to squash the opportunity for members to make their contribution in the main chamber of the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are no ministers here, no parliamentary secretaries. Nobody is listening. Nobody is interested. That also, to my way of thinking, demonstrates the contempt that the executive government has for the contributions of individual members. In other words, all these things
        <break page="4817" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         that are occurring in the House of Representatives, either here or in the other chamber, are entirely irrelevant to the conduct of government business. The way in which the government is conducting itself is not only no better than the conduct of the previous administration, in many instances it is worse. It is more authoritarian and, in fact, it is more oppressive than the worse excesses of the Keating government—and believe me, they were bad enough.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What is happening now is that the government is doing more than the Keating government did. The Keating government set up the Main Committee. I was an opponent of it in the first instance, because I believed that the Main Committee would relegate aspects of debate from the main chamber into the Main Committee and there would be a secondary debate. Members of the public probably would not even know this chamber exists, and the members of parliament would feel that their contribution was being treated with contempt. What we have, in essence, is exactly what I predicted, coming true now. But that is not under the Keating government: to be fair to the Keating government, for all the other excesses it brought to the Australian parliament, the Keating government never referred other than non&amp;hyphen;contentious legislation to this Committee, except in a couple of instances when it was pulled up, quite rightly, by individual members.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I just make this observation: if the government thinks this sort of thing is going to go on unchallenged, it has another think coming. It really has to fulfil the promise it made to the electorate in the election campaign, that it was going to make parliamentary debates, the parliamentary processes, more relevant to the community. It would raise them, to make sure that the government and the parliamentary process was an effective part of our system of governance. We in this place would all know in the bottom of our hearts that much of what we might say and much of what we might do, as far as the government is concerned, is worth nothing, because it chooses purely to ignore it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have seen occasions in recent times when the government has chosen to use numbers to crush individual motions. One instance was, in my view, a dreadful occurrence: a member who chose to move two similar divisions was ruled to be obstructionist and the second division was considered to be out of order. That is interesting, compared with the situation where the Labor opposition has moved three divisions on exactly the same thing but they have not had the same ruling applied to them. It is interesting that there seems to be one rule for some and another rule for the others.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The general thrust of the budget, in most areas, is commendable. I know that the member for Kennedy and others share some very strong reservations about the economic rationalist aspects of the government's agenda, and I do too. But there are a number of areas where the government has been forced into accepting greater fiscal accountability and responsibility as its essential duty to the community. After all, we are here, in essence, dealing with the expenditure of taxpayers' money, and we have a very substantial duty to make sure that is done properly, it is accountable and transparent.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In more recent times the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) pointed out that, in the Primary Industries Amendment Bill which was before this place some time ago, there was a $24 million appropriation from the non&amp;hyphen;wool assets of wool farmers to what was called Wool Holdings International, which was a body designed to encourage the sale of wool on the futures market. And how much description was there, in the documentary material which accompanied the bill, about what that was going to be used for? There were two lines in the explanatory memorandum. Did that arouse much interest or concern on the part of the
        <break page="4818" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         government? Very little at all. It is incredible that $24 million can be appropriated with only two lines of explanatory memorandum. That is incredible. That is $12 million per line. It is a very expensive explanatory memorandum.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But there are a few areas in the budget which I would like to address now and they cause me some concern. I was elected in Moore as the Independent member with, in my view, a role to play to try and ensure, as much as I am able, that the promises that the government made in the election campaign are kept. I have to say that a number of them have not been kept, and there are a number of things in the budget which were not foreshadowed. Some people have found them to their cost.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government cannot talk on the one hand of providing incentives for development, prosperity and the public good and then place legislative and administrative fiscal disincentives in the way. I am going to address a few areas where I think that the government can provide innovation and improvement. One is a light fuel oil excise rebate, something the member for Kennedy would know about because this also affects, I would imagine, areas of his own electorate. It is a matter of considerable concern to regional Australians, especially those in Western Australia and Queensland. The government made a very good decision, in my view, to leave in place the excise exemption for light fuel oil used in the mining and farming industries. I was one of those that lobbied the government to try and ensure that this took place. But I am concerned that the government has not addressed the anomaly created by the previous government where the rebate was removed for power generation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Regional and remote Australia are very dependent on distillate based power generation and thus are highly vulnerable to any increases that occur in fuel pricing. Most electricity consumption in regional and remote areas is directly related to mining and primary industry activities. So there is a little bit of a dilemma or an incongruous situation here. The government has imposed an excise on the fuel used by utilities generating electricity for consumption by the mining and primary industry sectors, and yet it provides exemptions for distillate used by the mining companies in those sectors.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The situation is being exacerbated by the previous government increasing the light fuel excise from 6.5c per litre to 33c per litre. In my state, this increased Western Power's regional power division costs by $18 million, to a record $44 million loss. Western Power generates and distributes electricity to 19,000 customers in 29 regional towns from Esperance to Kununurra. Much of Western Power's electricity is subject to contractual arrangements where initial costs could not be passed on to major consumers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Western Power is subject to the national competition policy—which I am sure the member for Kennedy has some strong views about—which disallows subsidisation to the regional divisions with profits from the metropolitan operation.

         —I was going to say that the only recourse in the case of Western Australia will be significant price increases in electricity for regional users. Large regional users face an increase of 30c per kilowatt hour from July next year, compared to the total cost now of 12c per kilowatt hour for supply to a metropolitan household. So, there is a substantial disincentive for businesses operating directly or indirectly in support of mining and primary industries, and it has great implications for development and quality of life in regional WA.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The other aspect where I have got some substantial concerns is the cuts in low levels of federal funding in the budget for programs which are related to fighting and preventing crime. These budget cuts are damaging to the morale and effectiveness of organisations such as the AFP and the NCA. Public order and safety spending is decreasing significantly as a percentage of the total Commonwealth budget, and this is occurring when the risks to the community from crime continue to increase.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The AFP is a principal law enforcement agency through which the Commonwealth pursues its law enforcement interests. This budget reduces funding for 1997 by $19.2 million in running costs, $1.2 million in outlays for plant and equipment, and $1.8 million in appropriations for buildings or works.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government gave an election commitment to increase funding for fraud investigation by the AFP. This cannot be maintained. This budget means that the AFP will lose staff and resources. The AFP has shown that there is a direct correlation between operational resources and operational performance. Cuts in resources here will mean a cut in narcotics seizures, investigated frauds and proceeds of crime confiscations. The reduction in the AFP's policing effort will affect the entire Australian policing operation. I share the concern of the Police Federation of Australia that this funding reduction puts at risk the whole reform program for the AFP.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I might add that in my home state it is estimated there is $1 billion of illicit drugs entering over the state border per annum. I might also say that in the face of funding cuts in Australian Customs, the NCA, the AFP, and the Western Australian Police Force—in effect, real cuts—we are going to see a significant problem become even more of a concern. In Western Australia we have significantly higher crime rates than the Australian average. As I have described before, Australia is a place where you are far more likely to have your home burgled or to be robbed or assaulted without a weapon than in the United States. This is something a lot of people do not realise. Crime is on the increase. It is a serious problem. And I am appalled that the government has chosen to target the AFP in particular for those significant funding cuts, as well as the NCA.

         The Australian Institute of Criminology was established to conduct research, policy analysis and information dissemination on criminal justice issues. It is a valuable resource in our nation's fight against crime. It has meant, in effect, that the state police services have not had to devote resources of their own to similar statistical research. But there is one particular aspect of it that I am sure the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) would be concerned about too. That is that the budget statement relating to the Australian Institute of Criminology has proposed the discontinuance of the AIC's violence against women project.

         I would have thought that members of the government would be appalled at that particular prospect. It is something that I hope they will work within their party fora to have overturned. It has a direct application in the fight against violence against women.

Under the circumstances, given that the state police forces have used the Australian Institute of Criminology statistical research for their own particular

         The dental program is another area where there have been some serious concerns. In effect, the cessation of the dental program is really a decision to underfund the last year of the program by half. We know that dental care delivery is a state responsibility. But the Commonwealth did develop the program to meet the high level of need in the community for this type of support. There is not any great evidence of a reduction in the demand, and I am concerned to a certain extent that the measure is short&amp;hyphen;sighted.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In the circumstances, knowing that dental care is an important component of health care, I think we will see an increase of costs in general health delivery as a result, because the interesting thing is that if you do not get your teeth sorted out, often that can lead to other health problems. We know that in a lot of cases, and certainly from the past, dental health care was considered to be one of the most important aspects of personal health care because of the primary fact that we have to use our mouths in order to be able to eat and drink. Therefore, dental health care is of significance and I call on the government to increase state funding that can be directly attributable to dental care because of the circumstances I have just mentioned.

It is unfair. It is, in my view, an unnecessary burden on pensioners. It is a burden that, in the first instance, was placed on pensioners to bring about some sort of fairness in relation to the likely unearned income that pensioners might be achieving with some of their financial assets.

         In the time that I have left, I want to address a couple of points. One is in relation to AQIS. The federal government funding for both the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Customs Service remains inadequate in relation to the risks our community faces. AQIS must be made efficient and maintained as such. This is not just in terms of its inspection and prophylactic services but also, most importantly, in terms of the quality of advice it gives to the government.

I rise to speak on this Appropriation Bill (No.1). Debt and deficit were all we were passing on to our future generations after 13 years of fiscal irresponsibility. The Australian community were led down the yellow brick road by a pied piper who cajoled everyone into believing his tune was the only beat to move to.

        The Australian taxpaying public were in for a big surprise when the Treasury books were opened to reveal what we all know now: not just the devastating $7 billion deficit that we found initially upon gaining government, but a disastrous final figure of $10 billion. We did not create the problem, but we will fix it. This is the whole purpose of the measures taken by Treasury to restore the economy to surplus. This will not happen without the measures outlined by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the budget documents for 1996&amp;hyphen;97.

        The legacy of previous Labor budgets, of their failure to cut government spending and their reliance on high interest rates, undermined Australian families and businesses. Under Labor, home mortgage rates hit 17 per cent. Interest rates went up nearly three per cent between August and December 1994. Family household debt rose to over $200 million. The current account deficit reached nearly $2.7 billion in May 1995, the worst figure ever since the statistics began to be collected. Under Labor, nearly one million Australians were out of work. Under Labor, Working Nation, the greatest failure, cost the Australian taxpayer $3.5 billion. What a waste on labour market programs.

        Previous budgets increased wholesale sales taxes by two per cent, from 20 to 22 per cent; increased petrol tax; increased excise on tobacco by 15 per cent; reduced the growth of defence spending; changed HECS so repayments commenced earlier and at higher rates; realigned HECS with income tax arrangements so repayments reflected the proportion of the year in which those with HECS obligations earned above the repayment threshold; increased the Medicare levy by 0.1 per cent, to 1.5 per cent; increased tax on motor vehicles by six per cent, from 15 per cent to 22 per cent; increased company tax from 33 to 36 per cent; increased PAYE tax payments to bi&amp;hyphen;monthly for small businesses—and the list goes on.

        On 2 March, Australians reassessed their priorities. On 2 March, Australians had had enough. On 20 August, the new government outlined the new direction for fiscal responsibility. For families, business, older Australians and those in genuine need, the 20 August budget met our core commitments. The family tax initiative means that a family with two dependent children, earning less than $70,000 per year and taking out private health insurance, will get a tax break of $51.90 per fortnight. That is $450 a year.

         The new apprenticeship and traineeship scheme will also assist business with employers being eligible for a commencement payment of $1,250 for each apprentice or trainee, a $1,250 progress payment and a bonus for each one taken on above the previous year's intake. Obviously this measure will not only benefit the small to medium enterprises but also benefit the unemployed. The government will spend $207 million over the next four years on the new apprenticeship scheme. That means real jobs for the unemployed, not the never ending training programs that were designed for one purpose: to keep these unemployed off the unemployed numbers list. The former administration spent over $3.5 million on labour market programs that did not work. In fact, two-thirds of the long-term unemployed are still unemployed after going through a Working Nation program. In direct contrast the coalition government will get these people back to work in jobs that last longer than the length of their course.

This flies in the face of the scaremongering of the opposition, which is targeting the pensioners of Australia because they are seen as an easy target. The opposition is continuing its attack on the introduction of a voluntary entry contribution fee for nursing homes. I say `voluntary' because that is exactly what it is—a voluntary fee which will be paid by those who can, not as the opposition would have us believe a flat $26,000 fee on all people who enter a nursing home.

These people deserve better than the treatment being handed out by the opposition.

        That is the most shameful approach to be taken in this country if we are talking about pulling this country together.

        Looking at the employment policies of this government, I find that what they are about is contained in the budget papers in the scrapping of the CES and the designing of a scheme of contracting out to the private sector the placement of people in jobs. Who will the private sector take? As we know from experience, they will take those who have the best prospects of getting placed. Who do they not take? Who are left on the scrap heap? The people who have greater difficulty. It is not their fault. That is one part of the problem.

        The other part of the problem is the economy. Looking at all of this budget and all of the projections, I find that it says—it is a wonderful objective, in their terms—that there will be no growth in employment. I will put it round the other way: there will be no decrease in the unemployment rate. So all of the prospects they are offering, all of the offers they are making and all of these changes are really about finding a way to cost or provide for their election promises, on the one hand, and concealing the fact that they really do not have a policy or a program that is going to reduce unemployment on the other.

This is setting Australians against Australians. Like it or not—and you might not like it, on the other side of this committee—ours is a multicultural society. It is a nation drawn from many different cultures that have lived in harmony, worked in harmony and progressed this country. This country has benefited from their presence and their contributions.

Almost half a million Australians utilised that program in the last financial year. In my own electorate of Shortland, in the Hunter region and in the Central Coast region which my electorate embraces, over 7,000 people used that program last year and benefited from it. Why is it suddenly abolished? Again, it is an attack on the aged. They think, `There is not going be much response there. They will not be a worry.

If you are getting the full rate pension, if you are on a base rate pension—

But, worse, why are you attacking sick, aged Australians? Why are you doing this? This illustrates the callousness, the ruthlessness of a government that is really out of control. You target a group like this—aged, ill Australians—but then you say, `Oh yes, they could dispose of their property.' The Treasurer (Mr Costello) said, `Well they could sell the property.' Have you thought about what is involved? It means somebody who is ill enough to need to be in a nursing home, who is in that condition and that frame of mind, is going to be told, `You might be ill, you might be sick and you might need to be placed in a nursing home, but you are certainly fit enough to go out and negotiate the sale of your property.' The inhumanity and ruthlessness of that is something I have never seen before—never even contemplated.

They have to be fit enough to operate a new piece of technology—and if they don't know, learn how to do it—and then get a credit made to their bank account, go down to one of the supermarkets and key in the amount they want to withdraw.

         Just think about the impracticality of that and the burden that imposes upon people in that age group.

They find it so difficult just to even get a letter, let alone face the set&amp;hyphen;up involved in this kind of scheme. So, as I said, the way this budget is being put forward it is an attack on sick, aged Australians. It is an attack on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. It is an attack on immigrants. It is an attack on people looking for work. And it is an attack on the families of each of those groups.

          When we come to working women and the changes to child care, this is based upon a belief of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that we should turn back to what he sees as the traditional family: father, mother and two children, and one income—and mother is home in the kitchen looking after the children. And, in those circumstances, if they make the cost of child care greater that might discourage people from going to work and might force women back into the kitchen and back into the household. I want to say to him: that is not going to happen. The world has moved on since those days. But the change to child&amp;hyphen;care arrangements and the increased charges that will flow from them will impact upon those families. So it is an attack upon them.

         <para first-indent="16">
          During the election campaign, the Howard&amp;hyphen;Fischer Liberal and National parties promised fairness and hope to all. But their first budget offers no prospect of increased employment. As I have said, it deliberately attacks sections of our community. Worse still, members of trade unions and their families are reviled almost as demons. That comes through repeatedly in the House; one hears it. The unemployed are to be punished as if they are responsible for the insufficiency of available jobs. No government in history has presented such a litany of broken promises in their first budget as has this government. But then, the Prime Minister is the same man who, as Treasurer, promised a fistful of dollars in tax rebates at the 1977 election, only to withdraw them several weeks after winning the election. That action earned him the everlasting title of `Honest John', a title he retains today.

          What we have before us is a pea and thimble budget: it appears to give tax benefits to some, but then takes them back, and adds some charges through other means. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) in his second reading speech detailed the example of a two&amp;hyphen;income family with two children under five years of age, the mother earning $22,000 per annum and the father earning $47,000 per annum, with children in community&amp;hyphen;based child care for 50 hours per week and no private health insurance.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The result of the budget will be that such a family gets $7.70 per week from the proposed tax cuts, but is $38.55 per week worse off as a result of increased child&amp;hyphen;care costs arising from the government's decision to withdraw the operational subsidy, estimated at $21 per week per child. When we look back at the attack on families, this government mouths all the language about families and incorporates the words `families' and `family' wherever it can into its speeches, but the reality of its policies as they are implemented is to attack families and sectionally impact to the detriment of families.

          I turn now to regions and the abandonment of the regional development policy and how that will impact upon regional Australia. Anybody who has a knowledge of country Australia and has heard the reactions coming from there will understand how fierce has been the response against that decision of the government. Linked also to that is the cut in road funding, which is a substantial cut in funds from the Federal government and a reduction in its effort, and that is going to impact upon regional Australia.

          I want to say something in respect of Newcastle Airport. Newcastle Airport is a project which we put forward and which came out of the federal Labor task force for the Hunter. Funding was provided by the previous government—some $2.75 million—for the civil facilities to be upgraded and transferred across to the control, on lease, of Port Stephens Shire Council and Newcastle City Council. As the one who led that task force and led the whole project, I am very proud that we have done that, because it could not happen under this government. It happened under the Labor government.

And not only that: that airport is now developing as a regional hub airport, with direct services into Brisbane and, hopefully, into Melbourne. That is an example of judicious federal investment in regions providing the link and the base to generate other activity and the growth and diversification of opportunity and employment in a region—the very action that this government has turned its back on.

           I turn now to the impact in the regions of the cancellation of the employment project works programs and the reduction in training programs. It is in the regions of Australia that the unemployment rate is several per cent higher than in the metropolitan areas. It is in the regions of Australia that it is always more difficult to find jobs. There is not the spread of industry and there is not the spread of opportunities, so we always do it harder—whether it is in Port Kembla, Wollongong and Illawarra, or in the Latrobe Valley and Geelong, or in the Hunter and other parts of Australia. Those training programs are much abused and ridiculed by members of the government, but those members don't seem to realise that trying to update one's skills—even if it does not place people in employment—does an enormous amount to lift the esteem of the people involved, and to lift the esteem, feelings and attitude of their families.

           Try to give them current skills and to increase their opportunity. No&amp;hyphen;one is stupid: they know that there are 800,000 people unemployed, but not 800,000 vacancies. If there were, it would be easy. Their opportunity is going to come from a growing economy, but that has to come from the diversification of regional economies—the very issue that this government has turned its back upon.

           On the Central Coast and Lake Macquarie, those programs have been supplemented by the work of the skillshare organisations. Toukley skillshare on the Central Coast has played a very, very important role and is sourced out of Wyong but funded by the former Labor government. They have done a tremendous amount of work in helping people who have a lesser chance of getting a job, who are always more difficult to place. It has done a wonderful job in helping those people get skills and some of them to get into work and regain the dignity and independence of having income from employment.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Similarly with Eastlakes skillshare, they have done a very, very good job. The winding down of the skillshare organisation is really a political decision by the government. It is not a decision based upon helping people obtain skills to improve their chances of getting work.

          <para first-indent="16">
           It is all very well for some of those members opposite to say, `But how many of them get placed?'. The reality is they know and we know that there is no `turn the key solution' that suddenly provides hundreds of thousands of employment opportunities for them.

I would like to tackle him on every point that he actually raised. In fact, his speech was very similar to every speech that has been made by opposition members in this particular debate. The point is that they are finding it very difficult, in the end, to be critical of a budget which has obviously been broadly accepted and applauded by the vast majority of Australians.

        They, as we remind them day after day, are responsible for the unemployment problem we have today.

Are they not immortal words from our former leader? The recession we had to have threw hundreds of thousands of Australians on to the scrap heap of unemployment. So I will not come into this chamber or, indeed, the other chamber and be lectured by Labor Party members about the problem of unemployment. They created, and they have left us with, a huge problem.

        The member for Shortland attempts to defend the former government's solutions to unemployment. He is obviously an advocate of training programs. He makes the point that people are better off in training and it is good for their self&amp;hyphen;esteem. But the point that we have made, and the point that we have proved, is that it was not good for their self&amp;hyphen;esteem. There was training program after training program. Half or three&amp;hyphen;quarters of them were mickey mouse programs and were not good for people's self&amp;hyphen;esteem.

        I had people coming into my office, day after day, in those dark days of the last few years, with certificate after certificate for training programs that they had been sent off to, predominantly to keep them off the unemployment list for a short period of time, if they were long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed. Then a cruel hoax was visited on them, when they found themselves, at the end of the training program, no longer long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed but back on the queue

        The solution to unemployment is not an easy one. We do not pretend it is easy. That is a difference between us and the former government, as well. They used to try and give the impression to people that they had all the solutions: `Here is another program and another bucket of money that we will throw at this particular problem. Here are a few people off the list for a while into a training program or a new work opportunities program.' That was the solution. Well, it turned out not to be.

        Our small business policies which were criticised by the member for Shortland are aimed at getting the small business sector working. That is not going to be easy. We do not pretend that it is going to be easy, and that is why we are not going to be sucked into setting some sort of target.

        The former government was great at setting targets. A former Prime Minister, you remember, said that no child would be living in poverty by 1990. It was one thing after the other. They had this great illusion that somehow targets were the solutions to problems. The fact is that we have acknowledged that unemployment is going to remain high, that there is an awful lot of underemployment in the Australian economy and it is going to remain high in the foreseeable future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is a lot of underemployment in the Australian economy that has got to be soaked up. There are a lot of people who gave up looking for jobs under the former government and who are now coming back into the system. They can see some light at the end of the tunnel and, of course, the participation rates are increasing. As participating rates increase, obviously it is going to be hard to get that raw unemployment statistic down for all of those reasons.

        Our policies in respect of the small business sector are aimed at creating the right climate for business—and that did not exist before. Our fundamental labour market reforms which this opposition, joined by the Democrats, is committed to opposing in the Senate, and the tax and regulatory reforms are all policies announced in the budget, and they are in the process of being put into place. In fact, a large number have been put into place.

It has to be the creation of real, full&amp;hyphen;time and lasting jobs. The utter tripe that we heard trotted out by the former government so often about the number of jobs they created! They used to come into the parliament and say,`We have created 300,000 jobs this month,' or some other ridiculous figures. When you got down to the fine print—and it was a matter with the former government of getting down to the fine print, getting behind the rhetoric, the exaggeration and the hyperbole—you found that most of these jobs were part&amp;hyphen;time jobs, even as little as one hour a week, or transitory jobs. They were six&amp;hyphen;month jobs for people who had been brought into one of these great programs and who would end up going out at the other end back onto the unemployed list.

        So we are getting on with the job of fundamentally reforming the Australian economy. The former government, to its credit, went down that track and did a lot of the right things. But they stopped short, particularly in the area of industrial relations, of making the reforms that were absolutely essential if the Australian economy were to thrive. They took some of the
        <break page="4833" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         tough decisions. They recognised that we had to find our way in the real world, that we could not hide behind high tariff barriers, and that we could not regulate a financial system in the world economy as it exists today. They took some of those decisions. But, in the end, they stopped short. We intend to carry the process on to its logical conclusion.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Our industrial relations reforms are obviously an integral part of reaching that conclusion. The member for Shortland, once again, fell into the trap of trotting out the rhetoric that we have heard from opposition speaker after opposition speaker here in his criticism of our nursing home policies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a lot of nursing homes in my electorate and, I think, the oldest demographic group in the country. So I am very close to what is happening in that area. I believe that the end result of our reform of nursing homes will be overwhelmingly positive for older people. It is a disappointment to me and to many others that the opposition has perhaps seen a little bit of an opportunity here to criticise an element of that policy. But, in the end, what they have done, and what they set about doing, is to frighten older people into believing that there is something draconian or something inherently unfair about this policy. What they have done is to misrepresent and distort that policy. They have seen just a glimmer of an opportunity to do that, and they have jumped right in.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When I have been putting people in the picture about that policy, I have been able to defend it entirely, because it is defensible. The end line of that policy—the former government would not take the step—is that we will have better quality aged care. What could be more desirable than that? What could be fairer than the underlying principle here, which was always subscribed to by the former government, that people who can afford to pay for this—or anything else, if it comes to that—should be required to do so? That is the essential element of this particular policy. It extends to nursing homes the principle that the former government introduced in respect of hostels. It means that people who can afford to make a relatively small contribution will be asked to do so. There is nothing unreasonable about that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Deputy Speaker, the unfairness of the opposition's misrepresentation is that they thought, `We will jump in and attempt to frighten as many old people as possible into believing that somehow there will no longer be a nursing home place for them, unless they either have the money or sell the family home.' But neither of those criticisms is true. We have made the point over and over again, although opposition members do not want to hear it, that people will not be required to sell the family home to move into a nursing home and people who cannot afford to pay will simply not have to pay. The principle of that is sound, and it is a principle that the former government always accepted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This has been one of only a couple of very small windows of opportunity for criticism in this budget, and the opposition has jumped on it in an attempt not to make a small opening in the window, but to throw it wide open and make people think that there is actually something draconian about this policy. I am happy to stand up here, as I have stood up in my own electorate—which, demographically, is this group—and say to those people that our policy means better aged care. Not only that; it will also address the other fundamental problem that we had with the former government, and that was a chronic shortage of nursing home beds.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In my electorate, there are people who cannot get into nursing homes. There are people moving from one respite situation to another, at a very critical stage of their life, who cannot find a permanent nursing home bed. The former government did nothing to address that problem. Everything was wrong with the current system, especially the funding complexities.
        <break page="4834" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         We have attempted to reform that area, and I believe that we have been very successful in doing so. So, I take considerable issue with the member for Shortland for attempting to jump on that particular bandwagon. I make the point to him and to the chamber that our nursing home policy has an overwhelmingly positive end to it as far as that particular sector is concerned.

        The member for Shortland went a little further down the track in trying to frighten my constituents, the older demographic group, about access to Medicare offices. Once again, he failed, in terms of recognising the fact that access to a Medicare office has been and is a problem. I have got two Medicare offices servicing my electorate, one at the southern end and one at the northern end, and nothing between them. I had constant complaints from people who could not get access to Medicare offices. Our solution to that, which is a practical and sensible solution, is to provide additional facilities where people can have access to Medicare offices. There is no suggestion in that—the member for Shortland tried to say that there was—that this will somehow make it difficult for older people. For a start, most of my aged constituents do not even go to a Medicare office. They do not even need to go. They go to a doctor, where their needs are taken care of, and they are bulk&amp;hyphen;billed for that service. We have indicated that that will continue. But for people who do need access to Medicare offices, for all sorts of reasons, we will increase the availability of that service.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Nothing the member for Shortland said and nothing any member of the opposition can say about that can deny that fact. They can try and frighten as many people as they like, particularly older people, into somehow thinking that this is a major backdown on some aspect of health care policy. In fact it is again an improvement in the status quo and I applaud that policy. My electorate welcomes that policy overwhelmingly and fortunately most of the people in my electorate understand what the benefits of that additional access to Medicare facilities represent for them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coup de grace, if you like, for the member for Shortland, from my perspective, is that he wants to get into the area of family policy. This a matter that is on the agenda in the main chamber today and it is a debate that I am looking forward to participating in very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. If there is one policy area that I have taken an interest in here, amongst a number of others I suppose, it is certainly the area of family policy. I stand here today in this chamber as I will in the main chamber later, very proud of the commitment of this government, as the budget indicated and underlined, to Australia's families. Australia's families were forgotten by the former government. The former government was diverted into all sorts of appeasement of minority groups and a whole range of activities, but in the end they forgot about the traditional Australian nuclear family which after all is the fundamental unit of our society.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe that was a fundamentally important reason why the former government was defeated at the last election. It had simply forgotten the mainstream. It had forgotten the important part that families play. The member for Shortland attempted to criticise the new policy direction that we have now introduced. Underlying that policy—and he was particularly critical of the implications for child care—was our commitment to providing choice for Australian families. Australian families said on 2 March they were sick of the government telling them how to run their lives. Our policies are aimed at giving families choice—choice in child care, choice about whether both parents go out to work—and an end to conscription for mothers who overwhelmingly indicated they would prefer to stay at home and look after their children.

It sounds like a contradiction in terms, but it is absolutely correct. What it means is that many people, for example, unskilled males who traditionally were in the labour force are now no longer in it and a number of people who traditionally were not in the paid labour force, particularly women, are now in it. So the result is that, in terms of the participation rate, we are at an historic high and we have the phenomenon—we are not Robinson Crusoe in this; it is shared with most countries of the OECD—of having high unemployment and high employment at the same time.

Logic suggests that if the privatised system is much more efficient, then telephoning Australia from Britain or France should be a good deal cheaper. In fact, as every consumer will tell you, it is very much dearer. That suggests there is something wrong with the proposition.

         —I remember, in my childhood days, performing in a school play. It was the story of the king that had no clothes. It might not be surprising to those present that I was one of the tailors who conned the king into believing that we had made him a beautiful set of clothes at great cost when, of course, he went down the street in public naked. All the people were cheering and commenting on the magnificent clothes, until a very small child said, `Mummy, the king's got no clothes on.'

        I make that point because today I would like to address the budget and the concept of how it and some of the contributions that have been made could be described as `naked'. In the context of this debate, let me start with a statement of fact, which is that too many politicians measure excellence by expenditure.

        That leads me to the speeches of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and the member for Aston (Mr Nugent). The member for Oxley, for instance, called for the closure of ATSIC. The member for Aston, in seeking to rebut the member for Oxley, quoted the acknowledged substandard living conditions of Aboriginal people. Unfortunately, I feel the member for Aston's examples were, in fact, substantial reasons for the disbanding of ATSIC and all the associated bureaucratic structures, such as the Aboriginal legal aid services and the Aboriginal medical services and land councils, that have so obviously failed to address the fundamental problems of the very disadvantaged people in Australia known as our Aboriginal people. While tens of millions of dollars are allocated in this budget to funding white lawyers to lodge land claims, there are many Aboriginal people with glaucoma who can no longer enjoy the beauty of their land. They simply cannot see it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Personally, I acknowledge the good intentions, on behalf of their constituents, of both members. The MP for Oxley, as the representative of an electorate where many white people are suffering low living standards and unemployment, feels that more attention to their problems is required and resents the special allocation to Aboriginals. The member for Aston concerns himself, quite properly, with the deprivation of the Aboriginal people, and wishes to give them help.

         I wish to give positive and genuine assistance to both groups, and I am convinced that the current method of service delivery to Aboriginal people is a total failure. Not only is it not helping Aboriginals, but it is consuming large sums of money that might go to other disadvantaged people. In fact, in delivering decentralised, conventional, bureaucratic structures for the Aboriginal people, we have created a typical third&amp;hyphen;world hierarchy: a small group of very well&amp;hyphen;off Aboriginals and a poverty&amp;hyphen;stricken majority.

         I lack time today to develop this further, but my solution is a complete reversal of Aboriginal funding, from our current top&amp;hyphen;down funding system, to a bottoms&amp;hyphen;up system. I refer the parliament to my letter published in the

         Passing to the broader effect of the budget, let me say that I support its thrust, which is to stop the process of increasing indebtedness of our nation and the burden that that applies to future generations. Put simply, during the term of the previous Labor government, this parliament, using the children of Australia as security, borrowed $70,000 million and sold and consumed the proceeds of approximately $10 billion worth of public assets such as Qantas, CSL and the Commonwealth Bank.

         Whilst I have had to take these figures out briefly and quickly, it is an interesting fact to note that in 1991&amp;hyphen;92, when GDP growth was three per cent, the deficit of the government as a percentage of GDP was 2.6—almost the same. In 1992&amp;hyphen;93, the deficit as a percentage of GDP was 3.2—Australia's percentage growth of GDP was 4.2 per cent. The figures for 1993&amp;hyphen;94 were 4.3 per cent and four per cent, and I could go on. The next two years we found a somewhat wider gap of just one per cent but, in reality, they were the years when massive asset sales were brought to account to artificially reduce the budget deficit.

         Whilst my education in economics as a science was limited to my leaving school examination—at the end of my secondary schooling at Perth Modern School—after that I continued my education in the school of business hard knocks. Based on that experience, I must say that turnover growth—that is, Australia's GDP, which is entirely debt and asset&amp;hyphen;sale driven—is not sustainable growth, particularly when in this case the expenditure involved was almost entirely directed to consumption, rather than to capital works. For years, this country has boasted economic growth which was identical to the amount of money that the government borrowed in that year or which it otherwise accumulated by selling off the farm. With that sort of growth, we have a situation that can only take us backwards.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Just briefly, let me look at the budget outlays therefore, by function, to show where the money has gone. In that regard, I want to refer to the massive growth that has occurred, for instance, in the provision of health services under Medicare. In just the life of that proposal,
         <break page="4841" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          we have seen a growth in outlays from about $3 billion to $19.4 billion. But worse, in terms of investing in the future, in that same time education outlays grew from $4 billion to $11 billion. So we are pouring money into a philosophical issue that never worried us once—called Medicare—and, in the same breath, we are cutting back on education which, surely, is an investment at government level in the future. It is like a business building a new factory—something that is there forever.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This budget reduces the government's expenditure by many billions of dollars and consequently curtails that accumulated debt. However, it also must have a downward effect on GDP growth which, in the national interest, must be filled by the private sector. The previous speaker, the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), tried to recreate this myth that government debt does not have an effect on interest rates. But when you have a government pulling $10 billion or $15 billion a year out of domestic interest markets, of course it is having an effect. Furthermore, a lot of that paper, when sold, is bought by overseas interests and contributes to the nation's overseas debt.

        <para first-indent="16">
         A number of criteria have to be met or the private sector will not fill this gap which has been created by a reduction in government expenditure. And it is a gap—government has been propping up this economy for 15 years and, as government ceases to do so, somebody else has to fill the gap or, yes, we will have economic decline. I am the first to admit it. But, as I said, the private sector will not fill this gap unless a number of criteria are met. These include the ability for business to hire and fire staff based on the staff's personal performance and the financial circumstances of the business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         No&amp;hyphen;one sacks staff out of spite. That is a myth that has to be exploded. This myth has built up that people have to be protected from businessmen who get up in the morning and say, `Who can I sack today?' I have talked to businessmen who have cried when they have had to put off staff—and I mean cried—because they did not know whether they could get such good people back when they recovered the financial circumstances of their business. The reality is that business does not hate its staff. It values it, but it has to have staff who perform. In times of economic downturn they have to have the right to put some of them off, and they cannot do that at this huge redundancy price. Their defence is just not to hire.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The criteria that have to be met in order for the private sector to fill the gap also include the productivity value of such people based on international comparison. Productivity value does not imply lower wages, but does demand higher productivity per worker than occurs in low wage countries that compete with our industries at home and abroad. It was the previous government that took the decision to deregulate the financial market and lower tariffs, and I support that concept. But you cannot ask business to compete in that environment with a regulated labour market. It is just silly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The new industrial laws that are being proposed by the government are therefore essential. The argument of jobs for jobs' sake is just another king with no clothes. If Telstra employs 20,000 employees it does not need and passes the cost of those employees to industries who must compete with countries around the world, then those industries simply die or never develop. If employing public servants was the answer to unemployment, why not just double the size of the Public Service? We could fix the problem overnight—except that we haven't got the money to pay for it.

However, if the Australian private sector is to provide the real GDP growth and jobs we require, it is absolutely imperative that this parliament—and I do not say this government or this opposition, I say this parliament—join together to take the lead of the Australian tax system out of the saddlebags of Australian industry.

         There is not a politician in this place who does not agree that the Australian tax system is a mess and a huge burden to Australian employers. I pointed out last night to the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), with his huge responsibility to people in the car industry, that $700 to $800 is the cost, as estimated by Australia's Treasury, that feeds into the manufactured cost of every motor car made in Australia, because of the Australian tax system. We blame the workers for their lack of productivity, yet we never blame the Australian tax system, and it is probably the worse of the two. I think that Australian workers have lifted their productivity; the facts are there. But, while we are blaming the workers and denying them jobs, we sit in this place being too smart by half, using the tax system as a political tool when we should be joining together, every one of us, to put down a sensible reform package for each level of government: local, state and federal.

Of course we should get together on these sorts of issues. It is too big for political pettiness. The Australian tax system is the worst. Australia is in a tax time warp, and the rest of the world is passing us by.

         Another urgent requirement is that interest rates fall by about two per cent, if the private sector is to fill the gap being created by the public sector.

          —In both graphs, the evidence is clear that, at this stage of Australia's economic development, a lower exchange rate is very desirable, particularly when our currently high exchange rate is dictated not by our economic performance but by our high interest rates. Interest rates will fall only when governments stop borrowing money. Inflation need not rise with a lower exchange rate. The international price of the goods that come in means that they will cost more to import at a lower dollar value and, of course, that will improve the opportunity for Australian business to fill the gaps. The simple fact is that there is no such thing as an international price for a product that has been manufactured. The price is what the local market will bear.

         Of course, the performance of local industry has a lot to do with that. You can buy cars in various parts of the world, but they look awfully the same to me; yet they are substantially different in price because of local market conditions. But a lower dollar value is not the reason that we will get inflation. Inflation will rise if the trade union movement seeks to steal from future generations by claiming the benefits of economic growth that would result from lower exchange rates. The joke is that, if they try to force wages up—as they are trying to do now, more for political reasons than anything else—they will force inflation up.

In fact, all the evidence shows that there has been a real drop in buying power as a result of some of these pay increases. It is plainly silly and it should not occur.

We must not have people rushing out for extra money the minute we start to get the economic growth we so desperately need to repay the debts of the last decade. I make the point that we can get the growth and we can put a million people back into work. It cannot be done artificially. It cannot be done by fiddling the books. Real jobs will only come with real growth, and governments have to recognise that.

         —It is a great pleasure to stand up in this House and reply on behalf of the budget presented by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). I believe it was a very responsible budget. It was, by its nature, a tough budget, but it was a budget that had to be tough. Many people around Australia understand that after the profligate years of Keating we had to do something to try and rein back the debt that was occurring in this country.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have heard many speakers on the other side talk about this being an unconscionable budget. They say there have been cuts in areas where people can least afford them and that this is a terrible government that has no compassion. They are ignoring the fact that many of them belonged to the government that ran up this enormous debt; a debt that grew from $30 billion to $180 billion during their term and a series of deficit budgets which could not continue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The last budget was brought down to bring in a surplus of more than $3 billion, and yet we found that at the end of the day, we had a deficit of more than $5 billion. That is total irresponsibility. Any company or any business that was running its affairs in such a way would be broke tomorrow morning. Australia is no different. We have to run our affairs responsibly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The members opposite who have been crying about the fact that certain areas have been cut, areas where people who are disadvantaged are not to receive the benefits that they received in the past, forget that if we continue to run deficit budgets such as that, if we continue to run up debt, then the very people they want to help most in the long&amp;hyphen;term are the people they will not be able to help.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are plenty of examples around the world of economies that have got out of control, where people have had to move in and take control of those economies. The very first thing that happens is that welfare is slashed. The people that all governments, all parties, all members of political parties want to help—the disadvantaged members of society—cannot be helped because we do not have the finances, we do not have the wherewithal to do it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was put by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) that deficits have another effect. They certainly have an effect on interest rates. They undoubtedly have an effect on employment. I put to this House that, in fact, the deficit that we have run up over the last years has exported jobs from this country. The fact is that we do not have the savings in Australia for Australians to have shares in their own companies. The fact that these companies, because of the debt that has been run up, are being taken over by foreign companies is something that concerns Australians. The very basis of that is the fact that we have not had control of our finances.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I keep on having people coming to me from my electorate—the electorate of Page, which is on the north coast of New South Wales—and saying, `Don't resile from the job. Keep on with it, because we understand that we have to straighten this country out. We cannot leave a debt to our children and grandchildren and expect them to have to pay for our profligate ways.' I am sure that there are a number of people in Australia who share that view.

        I believe that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) touched on a lot of issues in the community which go deep into this budget and go deep into the areas that budgets are about in Australia, those of funding particular programs about which many Australians are very concerned. I have been concerned that there have been members of this House stand up and try to, in some ways, downplay what the member for Oxley had to say. In some instances,
        <break page="4847" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        In many instances these days, unfortunately, in Australia we are not allowing freedom of speech. We are not allowing these views to be brought forward. If someone dares to say it, they are either `discriminating' or they are `vilifying' and they are howled down. I believe that the member for Oxley has every right to raise, in this parliament, the issues that she raised.

         —If you listen carefully, you will hear what I have got to say. If you are prepared to listen, I will tell you. The Labor Party, of course, have failed, because they are the ones who have created these issues. The Labor Party have failed in these areas because, obviously, they have not addressed the problems that the society sees. When people say that there are a minority of people supporting the member for Oxley, I turn them to the poll done by Alan Jones, which showed that 98 per cent of the people in the community had these concerns.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am not saying that the concerns are legitimate. But I have to say this to you: because governments of different persuasions have been pandering to minority groups for some years now, the mainstream of Australia feels left out. They feel that they are being discriminated against. I think that is the issue that the member for Oxley has raised. It is a legitimate issue for this parliament to debate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If you look at those areas where the mainstream of Australia believe that they are discriminated against, you find we have to address it. We cannot hide it. We cannot slip it under the carpet and say, `Look, it will go away.' It will fester and it will cause problems in this society that we cannot control if we do not address the issues that are involved.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        People will say it is discrimination and people will say it is vilification. I do not believe it is necessarily so. I do not say that there is not any discrimination in this country. In fact, I agree that there is. But the fact is that we must address these areas of concern.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not just within the mainstream community in Australia. If you talk to the minority groups—if you talk to the rank and file Aboriginal people—they will say to you  that money is being squandered and money is not getting to the grassroots where it is needed. The very people who need the support are not getting the money, even though we have spent millions of dollars on it. They are not getting the support that is necessary. It is something we must address. We just cannot push it away and say, `That is discrimination. You should not talk about this.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I might also say—and it goes back to the discrimination argument and the Asian statements that were made by the member for Oxley—that the real concern in the community is not to do with Asians, but is to do with immigration. They are saying, `Here are our children. They cannot get work in Australia, yet we are bringing people in from overseas.' We are saying that we have to bring people in from overseas because they have skills. Yet our young people do not have skills. I think this government has addressed that in some way in this budget. I think that you can go further, but there is no doubt in my mind that to give assistance to apprenticeships, where you are training people in long&amp;hyphen;term skills, is very important.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have had some concerns for some time now that the apprenticeship system has served its purpose. The old indentured apprenticeship system might have served its purpose. The world
        <break page="4848" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         has changed, changed dramatically, and technology has caused that in many ways. Employers can no longer afford to have apprentices under the old system, particularly where they have to go away for quite some time on block release. That is why they are not taking on apprentices, that is why we have not got our young people trained. I think that this budget does something about that, that it gives some incentive to employers to take on apprentices and to see that they are trained. Those areas are very important and we must address them.

        The Labor government had a method of just pouring taxpayers' money into this. I do not say that all of their labour market programs were bad. In fact, there were a couple of programs that were pretty good but in many instances, because they were so determined to manipulate the unemployment figures, this money was entirely wasted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We saw a program on the north coast of New South Wales in the dying days of the Labor government where they threw $21 million at creating 1,750 jobs, which was ostensibly to try to save the two Labor members up there, the then member for Richmond and the then member for Page. But people saw through it. They saw that this was just a waste of their money. This is one of the attitudes that are in society today, that people are sick and tired of governments wasting taxpayers' money.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe that this government was elected on some of that emotion. People were saying, `We have had enough of this, we want a change, we want to get away from the systems that we have at the present time.' I believe that the member for Oxley tapped into this emotion. There is no doubt about that. This government, if it does not listen to the concerns of that great bulk of Australians out there, will go the same way as the Keating government because people believe that governments are elected to do something about the concerns that they see in their society.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to get more specific about my electorate of Page on the north coast of New South Wales. I was delighted to see in the budget that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) had honoured a promise which probably emanated from the parliament of New South Wales where the coalition government there proposed a Motorway Pacific. It was a grand scheme for a divided highway between Brisbane and Sydney. We have an upgrade of the highway between Melbourne and Sydney, to a great extent completed at this stage, but the other great arterial road link in Australia is between Brisbane and Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Pacific Highway was a total mess 10 years ago until the New South Wales government and the Commonwealth government put substantial funds into it and upgraded it. However, it needs to be upgraded substantially if we are going to have a very good economic link between those two cities. I would like to say that this is a great start. We are going to have the sections from Coolongolook to Bulahdelah and from Chinderah to Billinudgel upgraded. However, there is a link in between that we need to continue on.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We should not forget that this is a start on this particular link and we should continue on. There is a link in my electorate which goes from Harwood Island bridge on the Clarence River down nearly to Woolgoolga at what is called Dirty Creek Range. That is a link that needs to be put through as quickly as possible, otherwise you will have to go back to the old meandering highway, up through the valley, and that is just not good enough for a major link.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        While I am extremely delighted that the government has found the funds to upgrade these two sections I am saying not to forget that project because I believe it would probably equal the Snowy Mountains scheme in days gone past because it is an extremely important infrastructure program for Australia.
       </para>
       <break page="4849" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         I understand also that the minister took note of another road which we call the Summerland Way which takes off from Grafton and wanders up to Casino and into Queensland behind the range, up through that area. For some time the Summerland Way has needed upgrading and I understand that the minister is talking to the New South Wales government at the present time—some positive talks, I am told—about getting an upgrading of that particular road.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That area takes some of the heavy traffic away from the Pacific Highway where most of the population is. That route from Grafton through to the Queensland border, past Kyogle, will certainly alleviate some of that heavy traffic in that area and I commend the Minister for Transport and Regional Development for coming forward with those proposals.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Small business was a big part of the government's election promise. I was listening to the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). He was saying, `How are we going to get all these jobs? Are you going to cut wages? Are you going to work at the lower end of the socioeconomic group? How are you going to do it?' I know the member for Lalor has been an eminent academic in his day but obviously he has never been in business, because that is where you generate the jobs. Jobs are generated in business. Unfortunately, I think, at the present time, of the wealth generating area of Australia, only about 11 per cent of Australians are employed in that particular sector. It is an area where we need to grow if we are going to get involved and if we are going to improve this economy. Obviously, small business is a very important part of that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I can tell you that from my discussions with small business, do not underestimate the effects of the anti&amp;hyphen;dismissal laws. People are absolutely terrified of them. Rightly or wrongly, they are absolutely terrified of them. When we have decisions in the courts over someone who was dismissed because they were taking money from the till and the courts let them off and say, `Well, you didn't tell them not to', I think that is a very sad day for Australia. I believe that that is one rule that you should be taught as soon as you can talk—that you should not steal. I believe it is a law that was always taught in our community. For a court to come down with a decision such as that is absolutely abysmal. The small business community has been terrified by it. While this approach in the industrial relations laws is to modify it—it is not taking it away; it is modifying it—to remove the extremes, I think is a very good move in the right direction.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other area which has tended to be overlooked, particularly by the Labor Party when in government, is the fact that in small business all of the equity is in the business. Everything they own and everything they have worked for over years is in the business. If you are going to tax them in some way that does not allow them to enlarge that business, then you are inhibiting a very, very large sector of the Australian economy. That is what this is doing at the present time. This particular budget measure is saying that, if you want to enlarge your business, if you want to sell a business and go into a larger business, then we are not going to charge you tax on that. We are also going to allow you to retire with some of the assets that you have built up. We are not going to tax that because that is your superannuation, that is what you have worked for. Surely those are incentives that are worth while and would be supported from both sides of the political fence, because they are so important in our economy. I think both sides of politics agree that small business is very important in Australia and it is an area that must be helped.

         I noted that some of the opposition did raise the spectre of the ABC. Of course, coming from a rural electorate, I can assure you that I am very conscious of the ABC and some of the
         <break page="4850" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          funding cuts that have been put forward. Can I say, though, that I believe the ABC over many years have not addressed inefficiencies, have not addressed their management structure, have not really closely looked at some of their programming. I believe that there are savings to be found. If you look at many of the major companies in Australia over the last 10 years, they have had some soul searching to do themselves. They have looked very closely at the management structures; they have looked very closely at their costs to see whether they could prune them and get profit back, and many of them have. I think the ABC is in the same position.

         Can I say to you, though, that I am certainly speaking out loudly on behalf of regional news and regional programs.

I would be extremely disappointed if management did not see the need to continue that particular core element in the ABC. I would speak out strongly against it if, in fact, that were the case.

         In the little time I have left, I would like to touch on the point that I probably came into politics about 12 years ago and that is forestry. I am very concerned at the present time about the fact that the New South Wales Labor government is using the national forest policy as a means to close down small country communities. I do not believe that the policies that were put in place by the federal government, and that includes the previous government, were meant to be used in such a way.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know that there is a very important need to have comprehensive and adequate reserves of forest types across Australia, but unfortunately we see that extremists take this to a further point which really does undermine industry and production and employment. Unfortunately, we have elements of the New South Wales Labor government at the present time who are trying to use this particular excuse to further their green agenda. I know I have the support of the members of the Labor Party in New South Wales. I hope I have enough support because I have spoken to a few in recent days. I call on them to look very carefully at the spurious arguments that are being advanced in this particular debate.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There is far too much dishonesty in the debate. If we look at the scientific facts, it is not supported by scientific fact but it can have very detrimental effects on small communities. It can have very detrimental effects on the economies of rural areas and very detrimental effects on the economy of Australia.
