                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment and Water</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:01</span>):  Last week, the Australian government tabled the high seas biodiversity treaty in parliament as part of our global commitment to better protect the world's oceans. Each country has responsibility for its own waters, of course, but until now there has been no agreement on how to protect biodiversity beyond national jurisdictions. The new treaty creates stronger protections for our oceans and provides opportunities for international collaboration, including on marine science, traditional knowledge and the establishment of marine protected areas. Through this treaty, the world is agreeing to cooperate and play by the same rules in some of the world's least discovered, wildest, most mysterious places. Signing the treaty, its tabling in our parliament and the analysis of how it contributes to our national interest brings Australia another step closer to ratifying this landmark treaty to conserve and sustainably manage marine diversity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is leading cooperation to protect and manage our oceans, and this landmark agreement is the culmination of decades of international effort. Australia was a founding signatory of the treaty in September 2023 following its adoption by the United Nations. The treaty is significant for creating a global framework which will be critical in addressing the threats facing the high seas—an area that encompasses 60 per cent of our global oceans and 90 per cent of the volume of those oceans. Currently, only about one per cent of the high seas are protected. Deep sea environments are considered large reservoirs of biodiversity, and it's vital that they be protected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a maritime nation and a nation of ocean lovers, Australia's prosperity relies on a healthy and sustainably managed ocean. The treaty will help to establish high seas marine protected areas which will complement Australia's own network of domestic marine parks. Together, these protected areas will play an important role in achieving the global target to protect 30 per cent of the world's coastal and marine areas by 2030. This is a commitment I fought hard for, and the world agreed to, through the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. I've since got the agreement of all of the states and territories, Labor and Liberal, to commit to this national target. This commitment is a crucial next step in delivering on our promise to protect and restore nature.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Healthy and resilient oceans are crucial to our engagement with our Pacific family and our Indian Ocean neighbours. Oceans connect us to our region and beyond through shipping and trade routes and the tourism that underpins many Indo-Pacific economies. They provide the foraging and travel paths for migratory species, and they regulate the global climate. The ocean produces more than half of the oxygen we breathe. But pollution travels, as do invasive species, and threats to the ocean are transboundary and impact all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is working hard to protect the ocean on a number of fronts. I am continuing to fight for a strong, internationally binding plastics treaty so we can realise our dream of seeing a plastic-free Pacific in our lifetimes. Last year, I tripled the size of the Macquarie Island Marine Park, placing an area the size of Germany in the highly protected no-take zone. This was the largest contribution to ocean conservation anywhere in the world last year, and it won't be our last.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a demonstration of our commitment to this treaty, Australia has committed $3 million through the Office of the Pacific Ocean Commissioner to support Pacific countries to sign and ratify this important work. The treaty will be assisted by the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which will provide recommendations on ratification. The treaty is a combination of more than 20 years of international effort, and our commitment continues. We are delivering on our promise to work to ratify the treaty and bring it into force as soon as possible. I want to acknowledge and thank the many, many committed public servants and environmental groups who have played such a crucial role in getting the treaty to this stage.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:06</span>):  The coalition thanks the government and Minister Plibersek for the opportunity to speak on this issue today. On behalf of the shadow environment minister, Senator Duniam, we also thank them for letting us know late yesterday that this issue would be coming before the House this morning. The government and the minister won't be hearing any objections or criticism from us today on the work that has been done and continues to be done on the United Nations agreement on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction, or, as it is often better known, the BBNJ agreement. That's because this matter has been for many years the subject of bipartisan agreement. Indeed, there has been a very long history of Australian activity and involvement that dates back more than two decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With no disrespect intended to the current minister and government and the various ministers and governments in between, the coalition would like to pay particular tribute today to the Howard government and its first environment minister, Robert Hill. They first saw the need for Australia to become actively involved in this particular process. Accordingly, they pioneered a considerable range of work in our country and beyond in relation to ocean conservation and protection. More specifically, they also genuinely played a leading role in bringing together governments to better care for the conservation of what is known as the high seas that exist beyond conventional international boundaries. Former senator Hill later became a commissioner of the Global Ocean Commission, a role which allowed him to continue to play a key role in efforts to broker international consensus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also during those years of the Howard government, in particular, that Australia made its biggest strides in addressing and improving marine biodiversity more generally and laid the most important foundations in helping Australia to increase the size of its protected marine areas. Ultimately, by the time the Morrison government left office, in 2022, that figure had reached 43 per cent. It was well in advance of the 30 per cent target that many nations now strive for as part of what is widely known as the 30-by-30 framework.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Foremost amongst the reasons for the pursuit of progress under the BBNJ agreement have been increasing pressures and competitive demands in relation to human activity in the world's marine areas. Indeed, the task of appropriately balancing environmental imperatives with economic priorities in marine areas has typically become an ever more serious challenge for governments around the world, and very few of them get it right. Accordingly, there is still much to be achieved by governments in an economic sense, especially for commercial fishers around the world who are arguably now facing the biggest range of pressures in their entire history. However, from an environmental standpoint, the work on the BBNJ agreement and the high seas biodiversity treaty, more specifically, genuinely represent one of the very best blueprints for collaboration on sensible and serious dialogue and solutions. That has been apparent at most stages of the long process towards ratification of the treaty, including the quick embrace by many countries of the opportunity to formally sign it once it became possible in late September 2023.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, being in opposition, our side of politics doesn't always have full visibility over everything that the minister is undertaking in this space. However, we commend her for her role in ensuring that Australia acted very speedily once the opportunity to formally sign the treaty became available and for helping our country to operate very effectively in its capacity as a member of the High Ambition Coalition of countries. Likewise, we understand that she is faithfully discharging the many other responsibilities and obligations that are incumbent on her as Australia's federal environment minister in this range of endeavour. In turn, we stand ready to assist her, if there's anything that the coalition can continue to add to our national government's work in this space. On that note, we again thank her and the House for this opportunity this morning and we congratulate everyone who has been involved over a long period of time to bring this very important international agreement to fruition.</span>

This take note debate is effectively a take note of the appropriations, so there is no relevance rule attached to it. This will be consistently listed as the last item each day in the Federation Chamber, which will allow members to be able to give more free-ranging speeches.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill empowers the government to direct Treasury to undertake independent assessments, and these assessments will be tabled in parliament to support transparency and rigorous decision-making and help deliver value for money.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important role for public investment will be to unlock the vast amount of private sector capital that we will need to deploy an additional $225 billion by 2050, by one estimate, to transition the energy system and realise net zero opportunities in heavy industries.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the framework and the sector assessments will be instrumental here—identifying the barriers to private investment and opportunities to address them, informed by Treasury's expert analysis and evidence based assessments on top of their normal policy advice, helping private investors to make considered decisions, confident that they know where the government stands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also outline a series of community benefit principles, because we know that just pumping capital into the transformation won't be enough if we don't pay attention to how we deploy it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The principles will ensure that our investments promote safe, secure, well-paid jobs with good conditions; develop skilled, inclusive workforces; take a collaborative approach to engaging local communities, including First Nations communities and communities directly affected by the transition to net zero; strengthen our domestic industrial capabilities and our local supply chains; and also demonstrate transparency and compliance with Australia's tax system.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They'll be applied on a program-by-program basis, recognising the different contexts and opportunities of these investments, including through Future Made in Australia plans, a new tool to support broader community benefits so they're delivered in a way that is a fit for purpose and project specific.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These principles will be our lodestar to help ensure our people and our economy are the primary beneficiaries of change, and we'll consult on the details of how the principles and plans will be put into practice.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our $22.7 billion budget investment demonstrates our commitment to this agenda. But, as I said, it's only a fraction of what we will need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Public investment will show us the path to a future made in Australia, but private capital will pave the way.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why our Future Made in Australia agenda is an investment strategy and it's a growth strategy, to provide investors with the clarity, certainty and the cooperation that they need from government. And this bill embeds the discipline and rigour to make it succeed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The golden opportunity in front of us will disappear if we don't take these steps. We've already suffered through a decade of denial and delay under those opposite, and, if they had their way, there'd be another wasted decade ahead, going down a nuclear road to nowhere.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a chosen a better path—a path to prosperity, a path that is mainstream and middle of the road that reflects the new economic orthodoxy of a churning and changing world, a path backed by evidence and supported by science, a path that will be rigorously interrogated and transparently explained to the Australian people, a path that uplifts all Australians and every community, not just some, a path that leads to a future made right here in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill steps out how we will put the discipline and rigour established under the Future Made in Australia Bill into practice: by expanding the roles of Export Finance Australia and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency so that they can make investments consistent with our National Interest Framework and to empower these agencies to help meet our Future Made in Australia goals—to attract and facilitate more private sector investment and ensure private capital is deployed in the national interest.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first will allow the government to make investments through Export Finance Australia in a way that is aligned with the National Interest Framework. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's playing a pivotal role in growing Australia's vital critical minerals industry—overseeing the government's $840 million investment to build Australia's first combined rare earths mine and refinery in the Northern Territory and building domestic capabilities like quantum computing that will unlock future industries for Australia. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ARENA is of course a highly respected agency with a proud Labor legacy, a creation of the last Labor government.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And funding will also go to establishing the Solar Sunshot and Battery Breakthrough Initiatives, and providing long-term funding certainty for ARENA's ongoing priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This 15-year funding will help ARENA invest in lasting, forward-looking opportunities, and we're legislating it, so that the funding is above the cut and thrust of the annual budget cycle. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes enhance governance at Export Finance Australia and ARENA, making the Minister for Finance a responsible minister for both agencies, alongside existing relevant ministers, as is appropriate, and allowing ARENA to employ its own staff to make it easier to draw in other expertise when needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To transform our economy and grasp the vast opportunities of the energy transition, sizeable amounts of public investment will be deployed by both these agencies.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And our goal here is for this public investment to catalyse private sector investment in a much greater quantity in the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill works together with the Future Made in Australia Bill and sets us up to become an indispensable part of the global net zero economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission found that the veterans' entitlement system is so complicated that it adversely affects the mental health of some veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Veterans' claims for benefits and support are currently assessed under three different pieces of legislation depending on the time someone served, and the nature of their service. Often veterans have had claims dealt with under all three pieces of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the result of decades of piecemeal change and fringe reform built on top of a century of different veterans' entitlements legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission's first recommendation was that legislative reform be implemented to simplify and harmonise the system. The government accepted this recommendation a month later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what this government committed to doing, and we've set about the mammoth task of embarking on the most significant reform of the veterans' entitlements legislation since the introduction of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 20 years ago. Indeed, this bill could be seen as the most significant shift in approach to veterans' entitlements legislation in the nearly 40 years since the Veterans' Entitlements Act was introduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who has engaged with the current veteran compensation system will tell you the system is unnecessarily complicated, difficult to understand and has negatively impacted veterans. This same complexity has directly contributed to delays, inconsistent processing, uncertain outcomes and claims backlogs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Calls to simplify the current arrangements have been kicking around for years, and I'm proud the Albanese government has taken on the challenge. This reform will significantly reduce the complexity of the system, ultimately giving veterans and families the support they need, faster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the royal commission's recommendation in mid-2022, through to this year, we've consulted on this proposal widely because we know that the best outcomes will come with the involvement of those who have been personally impacted by, and interacted with, the veterans' compensation system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We sought feedback on those recommendations in 2022. In early 2023, I released our Veterans' Legislation Reform Consultation Pathway for consultation. We held 17 face-to-face consultations across the country and six webinars, many of which I attended personally.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our recent consultations with veterans around the country, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive on this draft legislative proposal. Resulting from this further consultation, the bill introduced today now sees veterans in receipt of Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act payments automatically transition to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 incapacity payment system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that for many in the veteran community, the seriousness with which the Albanese government takes supporting our veterans was evident in this year's federal budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget showed that our work in properly resourcing the Department of Veterans' Affairs—DVA—and hiring more than 500 additional permanent staff to successfully eradicate the DVA claims backlog we inherited would see an additional $6.5 billion in delayed benefits and supports flow to veterans and families over five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget was also evidence that these legislative changes are not about the government saving money; rather, this year's federal budget set aside an additional $222 million for veteran and family entitlements over the first two years of operation.</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">
                    </span>At the heart of the government's legislative proposal is that on 1 July 2026 all veterans' rehabilitation and compensation claims will be dealt with under a single piece of legislation, the 21st century Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004<span style="font-style:italic;">.</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a principle, this new approach will mean that all veterans will engage with DVA regarding their rehabilitation and compensation entitlements on the basis of just one piece of legislation—one that will operate without the confusing multi-act considerations that characterise many current claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a step further than what was proposed in the most recent review of veterans' compensation legislation. The 2019 Productivity Commission report recommended taking the three current acts and combining these into two pieces of legislation. However, this change would have produced a whole new range of complexity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004—you might have heard it referred to as the MRCA—the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988, known as the DRCA; and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, or VEA, to be streamlined into a single piece of ongoing legislation of veteran compensation and other entitlements which will be continued in the MRCA.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes will also introduce a range of enhancements for an improved ongoing MRCA that will make access to entitlements easier and fairer.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes will remove the need for many veterans to make choices that are often complex and, in many instances, subject to individual circumstances, which can change over time. It will also remove duplication in claims lodgement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Making processes and administration easier for DVA is not an end in itself, but rather an outcome that will directly and positively affect veterans by allowing the department to be well positioned to focus efforts on vulnerable veterans.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are proposing that the new system will commence on 1 July 2026. The extended commencement allows time to ensure the veteran community is well informed on what these important changes mean for them and that individuals can consider their circumstances.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those receiving benefits immediately prior to the commencement of the new arrangements will continue to do so under grandparenting arrangements without any reduction in payments. This is a key feature of the new model that is designed to give financial certainty to veterans and their families. The provisions also operate to ensure that any payments being received will continue to be indexed annually.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning now to the detail: schedule 1 of the bill contains the key provisions that will have the effect of consolidating compensation and rehabilitation entitlements into a single ongoing piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changes will be made to close off the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act to compensation claims from 1 July 2026. All members and former members of the Defence Force regardless of when they served or the classification of their service will claim under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. In the meantime, all veterans will still be able to lodge claims under their current applicable legislation until 30 June 2026, or they can delay their claims until the new framework applies, or they can decide to do nothing. These decisions will be up to individual veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Income support payments such as the service pension will continue to be made under the Veterans' Entitlements Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendments in this schedule will also open the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to medical conditions already accepted under other Acts. This means that, if a veteran has had their condition accepted under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act or the Veterans' Entitlements Act, the condition will be recognised under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. This will ensure that those suffering a worsening of their accepted condition can receive benefits and payments under the single ongoing act, with no need to reprosecute the earlier claim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coverage for service only covered in the Veterans' Entitlements Act, including peacekeeping, operational and hazardous service and British nuclear testing, will be moved into the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Important changes will also be made to permanent impairment payments, to make them easier to claim and administer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Payments will be calculated from the first day of the month based on a doctor's estimation of when the condition started.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">These changes will allow treating doctors to provide a meaningful estimate of when an impairment met the requisite criteria of being permanent and stable, removing some of the existing onerous claim requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">There will also be certain circumstances in which a legal personal representative will be able to convert a deceased member's permanent impairment compensation into a lump sum payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Conditions arising from the use of tobacco products prior to 1 January 1998 will continue to be recognised, now under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A new liability pathway will be introduced into the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to allow claims to be accepted simply on the basis that the member was on duty when the injury was sustained as is presently the case under Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also transfers recipients of Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988, or the DRCA, incapacity payments to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, the MRCA, for people being paid compensation under the relevant provisions of the old DRCA immediately before the commencement date without the need for a claim to be lodged under the MRCA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This transition will occur from the date of commencement to the MRCA. In addition, the deduction of five per cent of the person's normal weekly earnings from the amount of compensation received under DRCA will cease as this reduction does not exist in the MRCA. This will mean a beneficial outcome for DRCA incapacity payment recipients upon their transition to the MRCA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 deals with important changes designed to enhance the benefits and payments available under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compensation for funeral expenses will be consolidated in the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Dependants and legal personal representatives of deceased veterans will be able to lodge a claim under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act irrespective of the act under which the member previously had coverage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">This will also mean an increase to $3,000 for funeral allowance for previous automatic grant categories under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the availability of reimbursement of funeral expenses up to $14,062 for all service related deaths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislative basis for benefits like the acute support package, household services and attendant care, the Victoria Cross allowance, ex gratia payments and recognition supplements for former prisoners of war will all move to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some aspects of veteran treatment arrangements will move from the Veterans' Entitlements Act to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, including the legislative basis for non-liability health care and the Repatriation Commission's powers to determine specific treatment programs and classes of eligible persons. These moves will result in no change in coverage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A legislative basis for the Repatriation Commission to accept liability based on a presumption that the person's defence service caused their injury or disease—presumptive liability—will operate by providing the commission with an instrument-making power to specify the relevant injuries or diseases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A new payment called the additional disablement amount, or ADA, will also be introduced into the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. Similar to the extreme disablement adjustment, or EDA, under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, this new payment will benefit veterans over pension age with significant service-related impairment. Like the EDA, dependants of deceased ADA veterans will also have access to the gold card and other benefits in the event of the veteran's death.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 will standardise the merits review process for veterans compensation entitlements decisions. The internal DVA reconsideration process will be removed and jurisdiction given to the Veterans' Review Board, a specialist veterans tribunal to review Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>DRCA, original determinations. A second tier of merits review to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal—the AAT—will remain in place. Although DRCA reviews would naturally cease under the model in the medium term, these changes will commence 60 days after royal assent, to harmonise the review pathway across the acts and provide consistency and certainty over the initial period of the new model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sections dealing with the powers and functions of the Veterans' Review Board will also move from the Veterans' Entitlements Act into the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 will simplify the governance arrangements for the veterans entitlements system. The Repatriation Commission and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission will be merged, leaving the Repatriation Commission as the single body administering all veterans compensation legislation, consolidating the powers of the existing two commissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change will remove duplication of responsibilities and provide greater administrative clarity about governance matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 will move provisions dealing with the Repatriation Medical Authority and Specialist Medical Review Council from the Veterans' Entitlements Act into the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>with no change to either body's powers or responsibilities, to ultimately make engaging with the system more straightforward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will now be a change, however, so that where the Repatriation Medical Authority updates a statement of principles, or SOP, between the veteran's primary and reviewable decision, the version of the SOP which is most beneficial to the veteran's circumstances will now be applied.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 makes important changes to when the disability compensation payment will stop under the Veterans' Entitlements Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, under the Veterans' Entitlements Act<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>the disability compensation payment cannot be paid for the 14-day pension period in which a person dies. This has resulted in some horrible situations where grieving families are asked to pay back a debt. This schedule will change the cessation of disability compensation payment to the date of the person's death, harmonising the position in the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>as well as income support payments.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">set out the circumstances in which compensation under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act can be paid for injuries or diseases which have been compensated previously under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988 or Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, in particular where there has been a material worsening of the injury or disease. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Herbert from moving the following motion immediately:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House condemns the act of defacing war memorials by pro-Palestinian protesters which is deeply insulting for current and former members of the Australian Defence Force and undermines the significance of these memorials as symbols of national pride and remembrance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must suspend standing orders to bring on this urgent debate. This is a matter of significant importance. It is our responsibility to the community, as a parliament, to debate these serious topics here in this nation's parliament. We must call out and condemn these disgusting acts, this despicable behaviour, and that's why we are calling on this suspension.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Saturday night's attacks were not an exercise of free speech but of criminal behaviour. The Australian National Korean War Memorial, the Vietnam Forces National Memorial, the Australian Army memorial—no cause gets the right to desecrate our most sacred sites. There has been outrage throughout the community. People are rightly upset. And I'm sorry that all of our Defence Force members, our veterans and their families had to witness such disgusting, such despicable acts that have occurred not just in the nation's capital but around this country. No cause gives you the right to desecrate these sites. It does not represent the community's attitude towards our ADF, our veterans or their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The freedoms that we enjoy in this nation are on the back of hard-fought battles, wars and sacrifice that those in uniform, those that have served and their families have made. To turn on the TV or to wake up in the morning and open the paper to see this criminal activity—vandalism, spray-painting, the desecration of the Australian War Memorial and other war memorial sites—is not just a kick in the guts to every veteran; it's a slap in the face to the Australian public, who believe in the rule of law and freedom of speech. This should never occur in this country or anywhere else around the world. And I don't believe it has been condemned enough in this parliament. I don't believe that we have had time to debate this, to call out this behaviour and to say, 'We stand as one, because this behaviour needs to stop.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The veterans community is rightly angry. From the time the first person would have seen this disgraceful vandalism, my phone, my social media, even my door being knocked on, like many other people in parliament—from veterans who are angry, who are disgusted and who are sad that this has occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's what a few veterans have had to say. One said: 'We should be proud of all of our veterans and those who have served. Those who desecrate memorials should be jailed. This does not fall under freedom of speech.' A veteran's son said: 'As the son of a Kapyong veteran, I'm disappointed that people have no respect for the personnel that put on the uniform in our armed service.' Another veteran said: 'It's so sad that these people who have fought, died for our freedom—and this is the thanks that they get. I try not to hate anything, but I do hate the people who desecrate war memorials. This is disgraceful. I do not stand for those who have desecrated these war memorials. People have paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom and they deserve respect. This makes my blood boil. And, as I come from a proud family of ex-ADF personnel, I want to say thank you to those who have served.' These are just some of the messages that I and others in this parliament have received. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I took a phone call only yesterday where the mother of a veteran was in tears—in tears because the one place that is the most sacred for all that have served has been desecrated. She said to me, 'Stand up. Be counted. Call this out.' That's why this suspension motion to bring on debate must happen—because I do not believe that yesterday's gag on the debate, shutting it down, as we saw, was in the national interest. We want to see both sides of parliament stand up and be given the opportunity to call out this disgraceful attack on our veterans and on the community, and call out the antisemitism that has been on display. We must debate this. We must.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has hit our veterans community extremely hard, and I think that it's right to say that they expect more from us. We have a responsibility to our communities and the people that we represent. This is the nation's national parliament. We must condemn these disgusting acts, and yesterday's move to gag debate, to shut down the discussion, is abhorrent. To say there was no time—it took 25 minutes from the first mover to when the debate was gagged. You cannot tell me that you have no time to stand up and condemn these disgraceful, despicable acts. And every single speech from a government minister, including the defence minister, should say, 'We stand as one in this parliament,' because that's not the message that the Australian people saw yesterday. It shouldn't be concerning for the government, because it is the same wording in this suspension as in Senator Lambie's motion in the other place on Monday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want debate to occur because our veterans, this country, want to see us standing as one in condemning the disgrace of the Greens' commentary of late, saying that desecrating the Australian War Memorial is somehow a part of free speech. They are not fit to sit in parliament and they are not fit to co-govern with the Labor Party. They are a disgrace. And a second suspension has been brought on because you cannot call them out, because you cannot stand up and debate this with us today. I would have thought that yesterday was the time when the opposition and the government could stand as one and say that the despicable commentary from the Greens, the kick in the guts to all the veterans from their commentary, should be rightly condemned. But we didn't see that. We saw debate being gagged, shut down, not discussed. That is an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These individuals, these people in the Greens movement who are justifying this as a form of expression, are despicable. They are deeply disrespectful to the memories of those enshrined on the War Memorial. More than 100,000 names are etched on the War Memorial. Some of them are my mates, and I can tell you, every time I hear about the War Memorial being desecrated, vandalised, it makes my blood boil. Then it makes me so angry when I see people coming into parliament saying, 'This is a part of free speech.' Garbage. It is not a part of free speech. You are a part of the problem. That antisemitic and disgraceful vandalism that we have seen at war memorials needs to be called out, because I ask you: who chants, 'from the river to the sea'? Hamas, a terrorist group.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister comes in here and says, 'It is okay, because Jewish people as well as people from Palestine both say "from the river to the sea".' That is not what the Jewish community has been telling me, and they are rightly angry. This is a debate that needs to come on. We need to have this discussion now. We do not believe it is in the nation's interest for it to be gagged, as we saw yesterday with the motion from the member for Canning. We need harsh penalties. I want to see these scumbags, these criminals who are doing this desecration, in handcuffs. I want to see them off the street and put in jail. This is not good enough. Bring on debate.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr WOLAHAN:</span>
                  </a>  We certainly do, and we have patriots who have served in uniform on all sides of this chamber. We have heard, again and again, calls from both sides to lean in to bring our nation together, because we can all agree that it has never been more divided than it is now. Here is an opportunity to lean in and focus on the thing that unites us more than any other—our war memorials—because when you go to the war memorials you will notice a list of names. There is no rank. There is no race. There is no religion. There is no party-political identification. They don't even have honours and medals, because the purity of their name and who they were as humans matters. And on that War Memorial are the names of many thousands of people who were not born in this country. There are Christians, Jews and Muslims. But for the bravery of people of every faith, there would be many more names on the memorial. I know, as the member for Canning and the member for Herbert know—we saw it firsthand—of the bravery of people of Islamic faith who fought side by side with us, and many of us would have had our names added to that War Memorial but for their bravery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this motion, which you have notice of, is about focusing on what unites our nation, not what divides us, because this is about acknowledging the people who said: 'This is not just a piece of dirt surrounded by water; it is a nation that stands for something. It is a nation with fighting for.' We acknowledge the service, sacrifice and unbearable grief of the families who had to walk into bedrooms and know that their sons had given up all their tomorrows for our today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Humans aren't very good at comprehending large numbers. Imagine what 103,000 young men looks like. Go to the MCG. Stand there and know that, in one morning, 640 from Gallipoli took a seat. In 24 hours, fewer than 2,000—1,917—from Fromelles took a seat. Those were the deadliest 24 hours in Australian history. That's half of the Ponsford Stand. Seven-thousand seats were filled from the Somme, the other half filled from Pozieres. Those who died at Bullecourt are 2,000. Over 2½ months, Passchendaele saw 12,000 young Australians pay the ultimate sacrifice. That's 12 per cent of the honour role in 2½ months. By the end of World War I, when our population was a lot less than it is now, 61,000 Australians had died. That's a significant percentage of the MCG for a small population. In World War II, we saw days where 50 rows were filled from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Montevideo Maru</span>. People from both parties, including the member for Canning, have relatives who went down in that sinking. In seven minutes, we saw 1,054 die. That's one per cent of the honour role. Then, in Korea, 340 died. In Vietnam, 523 died. In Afghanistan, 47 died, including friends of those on both sides.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what of those left behind? We have an MCG of dead Australians who died for this country, but imagine an MCG full of mums, another MCG of dads, many, many more of those who were injured and wounded and those who we have heard from the royal commission took their lives. Anzac Day and war memorials are not about glorifying war. They are about acknowledging who we are, who they were, what they did, what they gave up and what they left behind. But, as the sun comes up on Anzac Day and every other day, we don't just acknowledge the grief of what was lost; we acknowledge what they fought for, and we do that with smiles on our faces. We do that thinking of their last memories of home—and all of them had a last memory of home. It would have been a happy one of their family, their friends, their mum and dad and a place that stood for something—a place that still does. It's a place worthy of them and a place worth fighting for. When we stand up at citizenship ceremonies, these war memorials are for every new Australian, every Indigenous Australian, every Jewish Australian, every Islamic Australian and every Christian Australian. It's about what unites us, and we ask you to join us in this motion.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="132880" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I am pleased to rise to speak in favour of this important bill that is the next stage of this government working towards the Nature Positive Plan. This involves two elements: firstly, the creation of Australia's first national independent environmental protection agency, the EPA, which will be a body with strong new powers and penalties to protect nature; secondly, it is a step forward when it comes to accountability and transparency with a new body called Environment Information Australia. This will give government more information when it comes to its important strategic decision-making and it will give businesses earlier access to the latest high-quality environmental data. It will also report on progress on national environmental goals and release <span style="font-style:italic;">State </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the environment</span> reports. This is part of a broader agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government went to the last election promising a strong national, independent environment protection agency and, with this bill, we are delivering on that. In addition, since coming to government under Minister Plibersek's leadership, with passion and diligence in this portfolio, we have already passed laws that strengthen environmental governance and legislation. Last year, the first stage of the Nature Positive Plan was introduced when we passed the nature repair market, enabling businesses to invest in the rehabilitation of nature in a rigorous and clearly monitored way. We have also increased the reach of our environmental laws so that the Minister for the Environment and Water is able to, and indeed must, assess all gas and fracking projects in relation to their impacts on water resources. It is important to note that we are delivering more than ever in relation to programs, projects, policies as part of our broader nature positive Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is part of the broader response to a number of recommendations that were put forward in the Samuel review. The Samuel review was an independent review of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which is undertaken every 10 years. These are very important reviews that allow government, parliament and other stakeholders to see if the act is operating as it should. This particular review of the act, which was led by former ACCC chair Professor Graham Samuel, was released in 2021, and this report made the case for serious reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the major themes of the report was the need for greater Commonwealth-level involvement in a range of areas of regulation. There were some key recommendations. Recommendation 1 stated that matters of national environmental significance should be dealt with by Commonwealth responsibilities for the environment. Recommendation 3 was that the EPBC Act should be immediately amended to enable the development and implementation of legally enforceable national environmental standards. There were also a number of recommendations that related to compliance: recommendation 30, which is that the Commonwealth should immediately increase the independence of and enhance Commonwealth compliance and enforcement; and recommendation 33, which was to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the EPBC Act, and the Commonwealth should immediately and—there was a sub part of that recommendation—establish a national environmental standard for environmental monitoring and evaluation of outcomes to ensure that all parties understand their obligations to monitor, evaluate and report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a number of issues identified in relation to audits. An audit ordered by Minister Plibersek found that one in seven projects using environmental offsets under our environmental laws had either clearly or potentially breached their approval conditions. A separate audit found that one in four had potentially failed to secure enough environmental credits to offset the damage they were doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of aspects to this. One is the difficulty of matching offsets with projects, and, indeed, this is an area of microeconomic reform, which I think is extremely important, and I do remember speaking on that particular bill. It's very important that we improve these markets and have improved those markets. We can have aspirations for offsets, but, unless we have markets that effectively match projects with environmental offsets and unless we monitor those offsets effectively, then the whole scheme won't operate as it should. And those audits just confirmed that without redesigned markets, which this government has legislated, we wouldn't see the kinds of offsets that are needed. It's also another reason why the EPA is needed at the Commonwealth level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, in part, is setting up a new independent Commonwealth environmental protection agency. This will be Australia's first national independent environmental agency with strong powers and penalties to protect nature. At the same time, it will be based on a number of other recommendations from the Samuel review, ensuring that it is possible to make fast and better decisions. It will be charged with delivering accountable, efficient outcomes-focused and transparent environmental regulatory decision-making. The EPA will provide assurance that environmental outcomes are being met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, part of this will be increasing penalties. For extremely serious breaches of federal environmental law, courts will be able to impose penalties of up to $780 million, in some circumstances. Those kinds of penalties would only be for particularly egregious breaches and for particularly large organisations, but it is important that penalties match the scale of activities in a regulatory area, and, in this particular area, it is important that penalties be increased for deterrence and rigour to be in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also sets up Environment Information Australia. This will be an independent position with a legislative mandate to provide environmental data and information to the new EPA, to the minister and also to the public. Environmental data collections will be collected and integrated by the EIA. This will mean that there is consistent and reliable information on the state of the environment across the country. This will inform decision-making and rigorously track our progress against goals—for example, our goal of protecting 30 per cent of lands and oceans by 2030. The EIA will work with Australia's experts, our scientists, our First Nations people and other key stakeholders to collect the highest quality data and to produce consistent tracking of the state of Australia's environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lord Kelvin, a famous scientist, a famous engineer, once said that unless one has the ability to measure something, one has a poor and meagre understanding of it, and this is true in a regulatory area such as this. Unless we have high-quality data, unless we have consistent data over time, unless we are tracking that data and unless we are publishing that data, for transparency purposes, so that it is accessible for third parties, then I think our regulatory arrangements won't be functioning to the extent that they should be. So this is a really important step forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the EIA's promotion of accountability and transparency was a key element of Professor Samuel's review. Recommendation 11 of that review was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Government should increase the transparency of the operation of the EPBC Act by:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">a) immediately improving the availability of information as required by the National Environmental Standards</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that Professor Samuel well understood—that information is absolutely key if our regulatory ecosystem is going to function well. The EPA will use high-quality data that is collated by the EIA, and it will deliver proportionate and effective risk based compliance and enforcement actions, using that high-quality data and information. It will provide assurance that environmental outcomes are being met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of stakeholders have commented on this, of course. It has been an area of great interest. The business community has expressed strong support for providing more rigour in this area. The Business Council of Australia, for example, has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The establishment of the Environment Information Australia is a positive step in ensuring businesses and communities have transparency in their data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that business, firstly, desires certainty in regulatory arrangements, particularly where they're making long-term decisions. In this instance, not only is there certainty in the decision-making that the EPA will undertake, as a result of the regulatory arrangements established under the bill, but, as they said in that quote, there will be greater transparency for businesses, for the public and for other stakeholders, such as academics and scientists, given that the EIA will be making high-quality data more available. Professor Graeme Samuel said that, in the broad response to his report, the government and the minister are doing exactly what they should be doing, and he also acknowledged the complexity of this policy space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned before, we have the Business Council of Australia reflecting positively on the fact that the government is taking steps to provide stronger but also more transparent regulatory arrangements, and we have the Urban Development Institute of Australia providing broad support for the direction that the minister and the government are taking. The National Farmers Federation has said that, for a number of years, its members have indicated that the current act is broken, so they indicated a desire for reform as well. When it comes to stakeholders in the broader environmental movement, the WWF has indicated that the EPA is a potential game changer and the ACF has indicated that it welcomes the government announcement to set up an agency to enforce environmental laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have is a very complex policy situation. We have a situation that had not been attended to for far too long. We had a major review undertaken by Professor Samuel, which pointed to a number of serious problems in the previous regime, problems which had been acknowledged across the gamut of stakeholders engaged in this sector, whether it be environmental groups, business groups or other stakeholders involved in the regulation of the environment. What they all said was that we need, firstly, more rigorous and certain decision-making at a national level. It's taken far too long for a national independent regulatory body to be established. Secondly, there was an acknowledgement across the stakeholder community that it is absolutely critical that we have published information of the highest quality, collated from a range of sources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of local stakeholders, I've received many emails and other forms of communication from my electorate, indicating that my community wants to see progress in this area—that they support the establishment of a national regulator and that they support efforts by government to create and publish more rigorous information in this space in order for there to be greater transparency. And that is undoubtedly also the case for many other members in this place. This is an area where there is a broad groundswell of community support for timely and, one might say, overdue action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is an important response. It's not the first response of this government. As I mentioned earlier, there have been a number of other acts already in this term, important acts in this space, but these two very important bills respond to some of the key recommendations of the Samuel review, a very important review of a piece of legislation that needs reform, which this government, in recognition of its election promise and that review, is delivering.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act consolidates Commonwealth environment laws relating to environmental impact assessments, national parks, World Heritage and endangered species. Successive statutory reviews and other inquiries have deemed this act a failure. In 2020, Professor Graeme Samuel described it as 'gobbledygook'. He said that the regulatory framework 'has been an abysmal failure over the last 25 years'. Decision-making under the auspices of the EPBC Act is not based on good science or good data. It does not enable the Commonwealth to effectively protect environmental matters. The act is not fit to address current or emerging environmental challenges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's response to the Samuel review, its Nature Positive Plan, includes three stages. The first was the establishment of the nature repair scheme and the expansion of the water trigger to all forms of unconventional gas development in December 2023. The second phase of the nature-positive reforms is this legislation for the establishment of an independent environment protection agency. The third stage will be substantive reform to the EPBC Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has told us that the EPA is being established ahead of the broader reforms to avoid teething problems in the establishment of new agencies and to allow a smoother transition of responsibilities from the department to the new agency. The Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill establishes Environment Protection Australia as a new Commonwealth entity, with the chief executive officer as its accountable authority. That CEO can establish an advisory group to provide advice regarding the performance of the agency, but he or she will not be bound to follow or to publish that advice. The EPA will not have a statutorily appointed board. The minister will issue the EPA with a statement of expectations, but they will not otherwise direct the agency. The minister will be able to call in decisions and to approve new developments with negative impacts on matters of national environmental significance where this is felt to be in the national interest. The EPA's proposed powers also include the ability to issue stop-work orders and substantially higher penalties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The accompanying bill establishes Environment Information Australia within the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. This division will develop and implement a national environmental data strategy and oversee the national environmental information supply chain, including the Biodiversity Data Repository. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While new institutions like the EPA and the EIA may be steps in the right direction, if they act within the existing frameworks they will not—they cannot—protect native species and ecosystems. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's profoundly disappointing that the government is presenting us with this legislation in June 2024, having been in government for more than two years. We have no guarantee of seeing the final tranche of EPBC legislation in this 47th Parliament. These bills fail to provide strong governance structures or clear objects and duties for the EPA. It's my hope that the minister will accept the amendments proposed by the crossbench to address some of these deficiencies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the bill does not provide a definition of 'nature positive' which is in line with internationally recognised best practice definitions and focused on measurable repair and recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the EPA should be governed by a skilled and experienced independent board. Its CEO should be appointed by and should report to that board, not to the minister. Decision-making by the agency has to be based on the best available science and on clear rules. The EPA should be adequately funded and functionally independent. Its independence must not be undermined by call-in and exemption powers. Any call-in powers should be strictly limited and defined in legislation as situations in which the EPA has declared that it has a conflict of interest, for projects with a demonstrable public interest determined by quantifiable criteria or where projects meet clear criteria regarding national defence, security or other emergencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's laudable that the government is committed to community engagement and consultation during the development of this new EPBC legislation, but the legislation does not include provisions for merits review, which is key to ensuring public involvement in accountability. Merits review should be introduced for project decisions, and it has to be retained in those areas of the act that currently provide for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The EPA should not be able to delegate decision-making on matters of national environmental significance to state and territory governments and to other statutory authorities. We cannot trust states and territories with this decision-making. Look at the Northern Territory government, which signed a contract for Beetaloo Basin gas with Tamboran without a competitive tender process, in clear contravention of its commitment to the directives of the Pepper inquiry and without Beetaloo having approval from the NT EPA. The existing EPBC legislation requires Tamboran to self-notify if it anticipates a potential environmental risk, unless the NT government does so. We know that the NT government does not act in the best interests of Territorians on climate or on environmental issues. Given the risk to the Territory's water supplies and its quality from the fracking of the Beetaloo Basin, and in the absence of a self-referral from Tamboran, we're waiting for the federal environment minister to exercise her call-in powers under the water trigger. Until we see her do so, we simply cannot trust this government to enforce the EPBC Act in this country's best interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the EPBC Act's exemption for logging under regional forestry agreements has been disastrous. In Victoria alone, more than 300 breaches of logging codes were reported to the regulator between 2009 and 2017. None were prosecuted. The state government and VicForests have frequently acted with impunity and in active contravention of the EPBC Act. The Victorian government now claims to have stopped native forest logging, but it has launched an unsupervised forestry transition program, which will clear areas greater than those previously allowed for logging. It is removing trees which have high retention value and which are not hazardous. The VNPA, Forest Watch and Environmental Justice Australia have appealed for ministerial intervention under section 70 of the EPBC Act for the protection of tree geebungs, southern greater gliders, yellow-bellied gliders, leadbeater's possums and other threatened species. They've not yet seen action from the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania, we've seen the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal approve a Filipino-owned windfarm on the migration path of the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot and the endangered Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle. This move was applauded by both the Labor and Liberal parties at a state level. How can we have faith in our environmental protections when the federal minister fails to intervene on such repeated and wilful acts of environmental vandalism?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Delaying and splitting the EPBC reforms undermines the Albanese government's commitment to addressing the climate and biodiversity crises. It's especially disappointing when we've seen legislation prioritising fossil fuel projects receiving higher priority. We're putting off legislation for stage 3 of the EPBC legislation while this government brings bills to this House to facilitate sea dumping and new gas projects while Woodside acts to secure permission to mine gas from the Browse Basin, putting at risk not only the Scott Reef but also pygmy blue whales, dolphins, seabirds, green sea turtles and dusky sea snake species which rely on that habitat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A fortnight ago, the Albanese government approved a new gas pipeline. A week later, it approved the Gina Rinehart-backed Atlas Stage 3 Gas Project. This is a plan for 151 new coal seam gas wells in Queensland—a state in which fracking has contaminated water supplies. Water bores have been drained, and cropping country is sinking. Atlas will produce gas up to 2080. The minister told us last week that the project is permissible under the Albanese government's Safeguard Mechanism and the existing EPBC Act. If this is permissible under the current legislation, then that legislation is a failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a tragically high rate of species extinction, including the first extinction attributable to the effects of climate change in 2009. More than 100 endemic species have been lost from the wild since colonial settlement in 1788. More than 2,200 Australian species and ecological communities are actively threatened. One-in-six of our bird species is at risk of extinction. BirdLife Australia tells me that in my own electorate of Kooyong we have three threatened bird species: the swift parrot, the gang-gang cockatoo, and the white-throated needletail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Habitat loss is a huge and continuing problem. Between 2000 and 2017, 7.7 million hectares of habitat for threatened species was cleared, and 93 per cent of that was not referred for assessment and approvals under the EPBC Act. Most recently, we've seen the minister give the green light to the clearing of bushland at Lee Point in Darwin. This is bushland which is crucial habitat for the critically endangered gouldian finch. Again, if this is permissible under current legislation then the current legislation is a failure. The legislation before the House today will do nothing to prevent even further loss of habitat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many key threats to threatened species and ecosystems generally, whether we're talking about habitat loss, invasive species and disease, adverse fire regimes, climate change and severe weather, are poorly addressed or are not addressed under the framework provided by the EPBC Act. It fails to deal effectively with cumulative impacts and it overrelies on offsets for biodiversity destruction. Climate change is a foundational, pervasive threat to the matters of national environmental significance that the EPBC Act is intended to protect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Black Summer bushfires, more than 500 plant and animal species lost their entire known habitats. At least 100 threatened species lost more than 50 per cent of their known habitat. In the decades to come and in the absence of more effective action on climate change, such events will continue to affect us with increasing frequency and severity and with cumulative, compounding effects on nature. Nowhere in the current environmental assessments regime is this increased likelihood of future events taken into account when addressing or assessing the overall impacts and risks of specific developments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government still has not committed to introducing a climate trigger to guarantee that emissions from new projects will be directly regulated under the EPBC Act. Instead, it has argued that this should be done through other laws such as the Safeguard Mechanism. It is a ridiculous anomaly that our national environmental law barely mentions and does not effectively address climate change. We have to have a climate trigger included in the EPBC Act. It has to be inclusive of all emissions, including scope 3 emissions from new projects, and it has to include a proper assessment of the cumulative impacts of all decision-making by the government on climate. It should also include a mechanism for emergency listing of species or ecological communities where such is required after a climate related event such as a bushfire or a reef-bleaching event.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Four years on from the Samuel review, a comprehensive package of environmental reforms is finally on our national agenda, but delaying and splitting these reforms breaks the government's explicit promise to our electorates. It undermines the Albanese government's commitment to addressing the climate and biodiversity crises. We need new laws that deliver robust national standards and better protections for critical habitats. We need them now. At a time when Australia is already experiencing increasing and compounding climate impacts, we cannot afford any further delays in protecting our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Kooyong wants this government to act on climate and environment more quickly, more decisively and more effectively. I ask the government to accept the proposed amendments from the crossbench. They will significantly improve this legislation. Australians have lost faith in our environmental and climate protections. We need the government to act now to restore that faith.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:59</span>):  by leave—The Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill and related bills embody our Labor government's commitment to safeguarding our environment and addressing the pressing issues of biodiversity loss and ecological degradation. They represent a significant move towards a sustainable and thriving future for all Australians and the natural surrounds that we occupy and act as custodians over for the next generation, ahead of successive generations to follow them in the future, highlighting our commitment to environmental stewardship and the wellbeing of future generations. These bills also highlight another commitment, an election commitment, to establish Australia's first national environment protection agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Positive Plan forms the backbone of these bills, offering a strategy designed to reverse the decline of Australia's natural environment. This plan aligns with our international obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Paris Agreement, demonstrating our resolve to take decisive action on climate change and biodiversity conservation. This bill also establishes Environment Protection Australia, an independent statutory authority responsible for ensuring the effective implementation and enforcement of environmental laws. The <span style="font-style:italic;">2021 S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report revealed the alarming state of Australia's ecosystems, highlighting widespread habitat loss, declining species populations and growing threats from climate change. These findings underscore the urgency of our task and the need for robust legislative measures to address these challenges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon receipt of the <span style="font-style:italic;">2021 State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment </span>report by the member for Farrer, who was the minister at the demise of the Morrison Liberal-National government, the report sat in stasis on her desk. Perhaps even the member for Farrer came to the same conclusion that we did when reviewing the report after taking office: the state of the environment is indeed, in many instances, in a state of disrepair. The Samuel review, the Independent Review of the EPBC Act, provided detailed analysis of the current state of Australia's environmental laws and their implementation. The review identified significant shortcomings in the existing framework, including the lack of effective enforcement, inadequate protection of critical habitats and insufficient integration of climate change considerations. It was evident from the review that significant change is necessary to protect our natural heritage.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill aims to strengthen the regulatory framework for environmental protection by enhancing the powers and functions of the EPA. It introduces stringent standards for environmental assessments and approvals, ensuring that all projects and developments undergo thorough scrutiny. By incorporating these standards into this framework we aim to prevent further environmental degradation and to promote sustainable development practices. A notable feature of this bill is the establishment of the nature-positive fund. This dedicated funding mechanism supports conservation and restoration projects across the country. The fund will provide financial assistance to community groups, landholders and Indigenous organisations engaged in activities that enhance biodiversity and ecosystem health. It will prioritise projects that deliver measurable environmental outcomes, fostering innovation and collaboration in the conservation sector. Additionally, this bill introduces significant improvements to the transparency and accountability of environmental governance. It requires the EPA to publish detailed reports on its activities and the state of the environment, enabling the public to track progress and to hold the government accountable. Furthermore, the bill introduces provisions for greater community engagement in environmental decision-making, ensuring that the voices of local communities and stakeholders are heard and respected. We owe a debt of gratitude to our environmental scientists, conservationists and Indigenous custodians for their invaluable contributions. Their knowledge and expertise are instrumental in shaping effective environmental knowledge and practices. By working together, we can harness the collective wisdom of our communities to achieve our shared vision of a thriving, resilient and nature-positive Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government remains committed to addressing the root causes of environmental degradation and to ensuring the sustainability of our natural resources. This bill is part of a broader legislative package that includes the Nature Positive (Environment Information Australia) Bill 2024 and the Nature Positive (Environment Law Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. Together, these bills provide a comprehensive framework for environmental protection by integrating ecological considerations into all aspects of policy and planning. The Nature Positive (Environment Information Australia) Bill establishes Environment Information Australia, a new statutory authority responsible for collecting, analysing and disseminating environmental data. This authority will play a critical role in enhancing the quality and accessibility of environmental information, supporting informed decision-making and fostering public awareness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By improving our understanding of environmental trends and impacts, we can develop more effective strategies to protect and restore our national heritage. The Nature Positive (Environment Law Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 amends the EPBC Act to strengthen its provisions and align it with contemporary environmental challenges. This bill introduces new requirements for strategic environmental assessments, landscape-scale conservation planning and climate change adaptation. It also enhances protections for threatened species and ecological communities, ensuring that our most vulnerable biodiversity is safeguarded for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms embodied in these bills reflect a broad consensus on the need for stronger environmental protections and more effective governance. Our approach integrates recommendations from the EPBC Act review and extensive consultation with stakeholders, including environmental organisations, industry representatives and Indigenous groups. These reforms are not just about environmental protection; they also create opportunities for economic growth.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Investing in nature-positive projects can stimulate job creation, particularly in regional and rural areas, and support industries that depend on healthy ecosystems such as tourism, agriculture and fisheries. Moreover, fostering a culture of environmental responsibility can enhance the resilience of our communities to the impacts of climate change and natural disasters. Our environmental policies are grounded in a comprehensive approach to sustainability, integrating environmental, social and economic objectives. The Climate Change Act, which enshrines our emissions reductions targets in law, and our renewable energy transition plan, which outlines a pathway to a low-carbon economy, are key components of this strategy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside the Nature Positive Plan, these initiatives form a cohesive framework for an environmentally sustainable future. The <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the environment report</span> provided us all with an extremely sobering reminder of the work that lies ahead. It reveals the extent of environmental decline and the urgent need for action. The report's findings highlight the importance of protecting and restoring our national landscapes, ensuring the health and resilience of our ecosystems and addressing the systemic drivers of environmental degradation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Positive Plan addresses these challenges directly. It focuses on protecting and enhancing biodiversity, restoring degraded ecosystems and ensuring sustainable management of natural resources. The plan includes ambitious targets for habitat restoration, species recovery and pollution reduction, backed by substantial investments in conservation and environmental management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature-positive fund, a cornerstone of the plan, provides the financial resources necessary to achieve these targets. Through a mandate to support a diverse range of conservation and restoration projects, the fund fosters innovation and collaboration, enabling communities and organisations to develop and implement effective solutions. The fund also prioritises projects that deliver tangible environmental benefits, ensuring that our investments generate meaningful and lasting outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The EPA has been designated to perform a central role in implementing the Nature Positive Plan. As an independent statutory authority, the EPA is empowered to enforce environmental laws, conduct assessments and approvals and monitor compliance. The bill strengthens the EPA's powers, ensuring that it can effectively oversee the protection and management of our natural environment. The EPA is also tasked with integrating traditional ecological knowledge into its operations, recognising the vital contributions of Indigenous custodians to environmental stewardship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Transparency and accountability are crucial to the success of the Nature Positive Plan. The bill mandates the publication of detailed reports on the state of the environment and the EPA's activities, providing the public with clear and accessible information. Community engagement is another key aspect of the Nature Positive Plan. The bill includes provisions for public consultation and participation in environmental decision-making, ensuring the voices of local communities and stakeholders are heard. In fostering inclusive and participatory processes, we can build broad based support for environmental initiatives and ensure that our policies reflect the needs and aspirations of all Australians. The nature-positive bill complements these efforts by enhancing the quality and accessibility of environmental information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Environment Information Australia, the new statutory authority established by the bill, is tasked with collecting, analysing and disseminating environmental data. This authority will provide accurate and up-to-date information on environmental trends and impacts, supporting information decision-making and public awareness. High-quality environmental information is essential for effective policy development and implementation. By improving our understanding of environmental conditions and trends, we can identify emerging threats, assess the effectiveness of our actions and adjust our strategies as needed. Environment Information Australia will play a critical role in this process, ensuring that decision-makers have the information they need to protect and manage our natural resources effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Positive (Environment Law Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill further strengthens our legislative framework for environmental protection. This bill amends the EPBC Act to introduce new requirements for strategic environmental assessments and landscape scale conservation planning. These measures ensure environmental considerations are integrated into broader planning and development processes, promoting sustainable and resilient landscapes. The bill also enhances protections for threatened species and ecological communities, recognising the urgent need to safeguard our most vulnerable biodiversity. By strengthening the EPBC Act we can ensure our environmental laws are fit for purpose and capable of addressing contemporary challenges. The bill includes provisions for climate change adaptation, recognising the need to build resilience in our ecosystems and communities in the face of a changing climate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms introduced by the nature-positive bills are grounded in extensive consultations and evidence based policy development. We have engaged with a wide range of stakeholders, including environmental organisations, industry representatives and Indigenous groups, to ensure that our policies are robust, inclusive and effective. The EPBC Act review, conducted by an independent panel of experts, has provided valuable insights and recommendations that have shaped our legislative proposals. The nature-positive bills represent a balanced and pragmatic approach to environmental governance. They recognise the interdependence of environmental health and economic prosperity, and they aim to create opportunities for sustainable development and social wellbeing. By investing in nature-positive projects and enhancing our environmental laws, we can protect our natural heritage, support economic growth and improve the quality of life for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is imperative we recognise the broad support these bills have garnered. Environmental organisations have applauded the government's commitment to meaningful action. The Australian Conservation Foundation, for instance, has highlighted the critical role these bills play in reversing environmental decline and fostering biodiversity. Industry representatives have also expressed their support, recognising the economic benefits of sustainable practices. This collaborative approach underscores the wide-ranging benefits of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature Positive </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Plan</span>. By fostering a nature-positive culture we are setting a precedent for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The integration of traditional ecological knowledge into environmental management is a testament to our respect for Indigenous wisdom and our commitment to inclusive policy-making. Indigenous communities have been the custodians of our land for millennia, and their insights are invaluable in shaping sustainable practices. This bill acknowledges and incorporates their contributions in ensuring that environmental stewardship is a shared responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024, along with the Nature Positive (Environment Information Australia) Bill 2024 and Nature Positive (Environment Law Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024, represents a transformative step towards a sustainable and prosperous future. These bills reflect our government's firm commitment to taking decisive action on climate change and biodiversity conservation, ensuring that Australia remains a global leader in environmental stewardship. Ultimately, these bills represent a critical step towards realising our vision of a nature-positive Australia. I am proud to stand in support of them, as I have done at each step of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature Positive Plan</span> along the way. I commend these bills to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  This is socialism again. One of the things that drove me into this side of the political fence is the belief of the individual having primacy over the state—that the state is there only for service to the individual, and the individual resides above the state. Over and over again, you get socialism in a George Armani suit: It turns up. It's always the same. It's the belief that we don't know what we're doing and that we need the state to come in once more and get its fingers into the rights of private ownership. It's just like the other day, in getting rid of the live sheep trade—these incursions into your capacity to earn income. Now it comes in on what you own, it comes in on how you earn your money and it comes in on what you can say. Every day the state takes another step to diminish the individual's rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the silly dance where we all come out, and one side says, 'We love farmers; farmers are alright, we love farmers.' Then we come out and say, 'We love the environment; we'd never hurt the environment.' And maybe both of those are correct. But in the meantime it doesn't come down to free choice; it comes down to laws: 'You're not allowed to do that anymore. You're not allowed to touch that anymore.' It's hard when you're trying to understand that the centralisation of the state is very close—</span>

                    </a>  We believe in a multiplicity of buyers, a multiplicity of sellers and transparency of transactions, because these are the things that give the individual the capacity to transcend through the economic and social stratifications of life to their highest levels, limited only by the individual's innate ability. It's called freedom, and it's a marvellous thing. Freedom allows you to say what you want. Freedom allows you to be who you want to be. Freedom allows you to hold an asset, whether it's your house or a business, and say: 'This is mine. I've got this. I've got security and I have protection.' But when you get things like this Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024—they never come out and say it's the 'socialism bill'; they always come up with this marvellous nomenclature—who wouldn't believe in positive nature? Of course you'd believe in positive nature. But we have other things which are all part of this nomenclature. They always have this impending catastrophe which comes hand in glove with legislation and which always does the same thing: it imposes on the rights of the individual.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard about renewables, and that sounds good. Who wouldn't support renewables? But they aren't actually renewables. In fact, when they finish with them and they have a period of obsolescence, these swindle factories bury them in landfill. It's intermittent power. And who sits behind it? Centralised wealth and people who have a bucketload of money—multiple billionaires who are turning themselves into more billionaires. It isn't your intermittent power; you don't own it. You have to pay for it, though, through your power bill. Every time you turn on that switch, money goes overseas to Chinese real estate companies, Singaporean companies or Dutch companies. It goes straight off to a billionaire.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And we accept that, because the nomenclature says that you're a guilty person; you're below contempt and you aren't an enlightened person unless you unquestioningly believe in their right to take money off you. That's how they do it. They do it by virtue-guarding themselves and reaching into your pocket. And then they talk about wind farms. Farms? Farms grow carrots, peas and spuds. These are towers and transmission lines, all subsidised. They have capital investment schemes which are secret. You're not allowed to know how much the government is paying those billionaires to build them. It works like this, basically: no matter what they do, they get money. Even if they produce fairy floss, you pay them. If you're going to rip someone off, you need to say nice things before you do it; 'you need to kiss me before you go to the next step'. This is how they do it in a commercial sense.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to a deeper morality about this nature repair bill. This is about closing down the land so that it goes back to scrub. If you do that, you close down some of the capacity for us to produce food. The world is going towards 10 billion people. We are past eight billion people. Now, because we had the big green revolution back in the 1940s—fertiliser and better genetics, all started in the late forties.</span>

                    </a>  Go back and read about it. We then had the capacity for the world to catch up to its food task but now we're falling behind again, so the number of people who are starving is now increasing exponentially. But you don't see them because they eat from the bottom of the food stack. They are in the Horn of Africa. They are in Central America. They are in the Pacific Islands. They are in parts of South-East Asia. They don't eat anymore. Well, they might get one meal every couple of days but there is a real paucity in their diet. The more we take food out of that food stack, the more people will starve. They are not going to starve just because Australia doesn't produce; we are not the food basket of the world. But we are on the moral positive; we add to that food stack. This says that, for the purpose of a feeling, you are going to remove food from that food stack. So absolutely you are connected to basically exacerbating the issue of starvation, and it is as pure as that. If you don't think so, are you adding food to the food stack or taking it away? Because if you are taking it away, you are exacerbating the problem because it is very connected.</span>

'We are that far into our term, getting close to an election, better fix up the live sheep trade—close that down. Better shut down some more country and put it in the hands of the state.' You don't even need to buy it; you just put so many caveats on it that ipso facto the state is the owner, and that is socialism. That is all it is: socialism—the social ownership of assets. That is what this is: 'We need to pay these people off before we get to the election, square the accounts with them.'</span>

It is really simple: we stop producing food. We remove people's opportunity to get ahead. Overwhelmingly, the people who become farmers didn't go to university, many of them. They are just people who, by the sweat of their brow, got ahead. And if it is not them, it is the contractors who work for them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just got off the phone. I heard about another form of socialisation. Up there in the Hunter Valley, protesters are sitting on the railway line so we can't move coal. They are doing that because they believe it is morally proper that somewhere in the world they can't turn on their lights, can't afford their power. They want to shut down the coal industry. Once more, it is for the moral paradigm—I want to save the world. But in saving the world, there is a pensioner somewhere who can't afford their power bill right now.</span>

At minus 17, if you leave the window open, you die—a very simple equation. People who are poor, and there were a lot of poor people in my area, have to stay warm, so they either cut firewood or turn on the heater. Poor people have poor electrical appliances that cost a lot of money. They have poor cars that cost a lot of money to run, they have poor electrical appliances, and we moralise about making them poorer. We think it is morally good that poor people become poorer, and that is exactly what happens.</span>

A lot of poor people in my area are Aboriginal. I know them very well—very well. They're the ones who are hurt the most. But we don't worry about that, because it's not the kind of vision we want. We've got a different vision of what we want to see. These 'nature positive' bills are really just another mechanism for socialism to creep, by caveat and by addendum, further into the capacity of private ownership.</span>

The gas, coal and oil were owned by the landowner. Then, through war, they said, 'It's proper that we vest this in the state,' and they did. But then the war ended and they never gave it back; they just kept it. The last part of that was under Neville Wran. Then it became an environmental issue, a biodiversity issue, and they decided to take the vegetation—the trees you owned. They didn't pay for them; they just took them. They just made laws: if you touch them you go to jail, literally—but not the swindle factories; they don't. They can do whatever they like. That's the billionaire lobby group, the intermittent power lobby group. They are very powerful. They have orange lanyards and they get whatever they want. They're very clever. When you've got big money, you've got big lawyers and big solicitors, you go a big way in this building. You can basically buy what you want. And they say, 'Don't argue about it; otherwise you're a denier. You don't believe. You're contemptible.' We lost the vegetation and now this is the next intrusion. We still pay the rates, we still pay the insurance, we still have to try to employ people and somehow produce food, but more and more of our lives is owned by the state or controlled by the state.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's great to see the member for Parkes here, who's now in the New England electorate. I say to my side: you've got to understand why you come into this building. If for nothing else, it's your belief in private ownership, the liberty of the individual—that you can go unmolested through life; live your own life, not be ruled by the state, not have another boss; live by your own corporate manual, not the state's corporate manual; dress in your own uniform, not the state's uniform; go to a job on your own terms, not the state's terms; own your own house, not have the state own your house or your property; get the state out of your life and be free. Be free. Enjoy that freedom. It's a fading concept across the globe.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Be very sceptical about things such as this, the 'nature positive' bill. Any time you see that euphemistic nomenclature, start looking very closely at exactly what is going on. Be the cynic. There is nothing wrong with being the cynic. Be the cynic and ask the questions. Don't blindly accept that intermittent power is renewable. Don't blindly accept that wind farms are farms. Don't blindly accept that a whole heap of private overseas companies, billionaires, are trying to look after you when they put in intermittent power. Don't go without questions. Ask the questions: 'Who are you? How much money are we paying you? What are you actually doing? Are you really looking after the environment, or are you making yourselves a bundle of money?' If you come to the conclusion that they are, call it what it is: 'This is a swindle. It's not environmental; it's a swindle. You're swindling me out of my dough. That's what you're doing.' And when you see this, which goes hand in glove with that, just be cautious.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265990" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I rise to make my contribution to the Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024 and the Nature Positive (Environment Information Australia) Bill 2024. The introduction of these bills marks another important milestone in the protection of Australia's unique ecosystems, another milestone that builds on the Albanese government's strong action on climate change and environmental protection since coming into office in 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On climate change, the government has already increased Australia's woefully inadequate emissions reduction targets, bringing us into line with the rest of the world, and enshrined them in legislation. It has passed changes to the Safeguard Mechanism to ensure Australia's highest emitters reduce their emissions in line with our emission reduction targets. It has introduced and then tripled the Capacity Investment Scheme and set a target of 82 per cent renewables in the NEM by 2030. Only recently, I spoke on the bill to permanently introduce the Net Zero Economy Authority to help manage the transition to net zero, another critical step in climate action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the environment, the Albanese government has expanded the water trigger to ensure all new gas developments consider their impact on water; protected an extra 40 million hectares of the Australian ocean and bush—an area which is the size of Germany; and invested $500 million to better protect Australia's threatened plants and animals, tackling invasive species. It has doubled funding for national parks, introduced the world's first nature repair market, rescued the Murray-Darling Basin plan after a decade of neglect under those opposite and delivered $1.2 billion to protect the Great Barrier Reef. And the list is not finished there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In two years, this government has done more for the environment and climate action than the previous government did in the decade they were in power, because this government understand the importance of protecting Australia's unique and fragile ecosystems, and we recognise that is much more to be done. It is no longer good enough to protect nature; it is vital that we also restore it, which is why the Albanese government released the Nature Positive Plan at the end of 2022, committing to not only protect nature but leave it in a better state than what we found it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Nature positive' is not just a slogan, and these bills properly define what it means. Simply, it will be the improvement of our ecosystems as well as the species that rely on them, and that is important because it will mean that there will be a legislated definition and baseline that the environment can be measured against. It will be the first time a country has defined and legislated 'nature positive'. This forms the building blocks to the government's approach to environmental protection and is fundamental to the other measures established in these bills, the first of which is Environment Protection Australia, or the EPA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the establishment of an EPA, the Albanese government delivers on another election commitment. It is an important step in environmental protection. The EPA, once fully established, will play an important role in delivering on the Albanese government's Nature Positive Plan and will reinforce Australia's environmental laws. It will be independent and have strong new monitoring, compliance and enforcement powers. This follows a recent audit by the Minister for the Environment and Water, which found that one in seven developments may be breaching their offset conditions. Additionally, the Samuel review found that the regulator failed to fulfil the necessary functions of enforcing development conditions. It found that enforcement was rare and that penalties must be more than simply the cost of doing business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also commissioned and released the audit into environmental offsets, which highlighted further failings in the current system. These bills form part of the Albanese government's response to the audits and the Samuel review while the work on the next stage of our environmental reforms continues. The EPA will have a wide range of powers, including the ability to issue environmental protection orders, or stop-work orders, to those breaking the laws, and it will be able to audit businesses to ensure compliance. The body will also advise the minister and the government on how Australia's environmental laws can be improved. Importantly, the government will be increasing penalties to ensure that they act as a genuine deterrent. The new civil penalty formula will be in line with those applied to financial crime, and, for the most extreme and serious breaches of the law, courts will be able to impose penalties of up to $780 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills will also establish Environment Information Australia. The head of EIA will be an independent decision-maker with a clear legislative mandate to provide authoritative, high-quality environmental data and information to EPA, the minister and the public via a public website. It will track and report on the progress of Australia's environmental goals, such as the Albanese government's commitment to protecting 30 per cent of Australia's land and seas by 2030, and it will publish the state of the environment report every two years instead of five to encourage greater transparency on the health of Australia's environment and allow for more responsive action. The bills will also make it a requirement that the government of the day commit publicly to the national environmental goals in response to the report, and the government will be required to report on that progress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The EIA will develop a database that can be easily accessed by business to make federal environmental approvals smoother and to help avoid duplication in scientific studies. The EIA will work in collaboration with the EPA to ensure that the EPA is acting on the best available data, alongside state and territory governments, to enable better availability and use of that data, both in planning and in decision-making. Currently, environmental information is fragmented, of an unknown quality and often difficult to access. The EIA will play an important role in providing reliable data and information, which is fundamental to effective protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government went to the 2022 election promising a strong EPA, and this is what these bills will deliver. They will ensure not only that there is a strong compliance body—and stronger penalties to ensure compliance—but that there is also reliable and robust information to inform environmental decisions. These bills represent the second stage of the Albanese government's ambitious environmental reforms, and I look forward to working with the minister to better protect what makes Australia so unique. I now commend the bills to the House. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  This Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024 is the thin edge of the wedge. What really perturbs me and so many others, particularly farmers, is that their lives and livelihoods are being encroached upon more and more. They have so much difficulty doing what they do now, without another layer of bureaucracy being placed over their occupations, their industries and how they go about their business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What really concerns many as well is what happens if, after the next election, there is a minority Labor government operating in conjunction with a crossbench and, in particular, the Greens political party, because that would be disastrous for this nation—because the Greens political party is not just an environment party; the Greens political party is much more than that. They, dangerously, want to change the way we live. They, dangerously, want to rewrite history. They, dangerously, want to pervert the future such that the way we have modelled our society is altered for the worse in years to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The simple truth is that this bill is bad for business and it's particularly bad for rural and regional and remote communities. Why? Because it's yet another example of more restrictive, and worse, regulation. This regulation—red tape, green tape, green lawfare; call it what you will—is being foisted onto small and local businesses. They don't have chief financial officers. They don't have compliance officers. They don't have human resources managers. But hang on; yes, they do, because they're all of those things. The mum-and-dad businesses are doing all of that and so much more. And if they do employ people—and that's becoming increasingly difficult for all manner of reasons—then they often pay that person or persons more than what they take home themselves. They never have a holiday.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's particularly hard for those businesses which operate somehow, somewhere in a space involving environmental laws. It's just making it harder to employ people. The barriers they face are forcing them to not employ people, to do it all themselves, to work harder and harder and harder, almost into an early grave. Take the phasing out of gillnet fishing on the Great Barrier Reef: provisions under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, the EPBC Act, mean it is becoming increasingly difficult. I know that some of what we face here is state compliance, state law, but—come on!—do we really need another environmental protection authority overseeing everything?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When people come to your electorate office and complain about this, that and everything else under environmental law, it becomes so difficult to know whether it's going to be a state EPA or the Commonwealth's jurisdiction. It all gets caught up, and I think sometimes that's what government wants; that's what the bureaucracy wants. They want these things to be tied up for years and years and years. It's no wonder nothing ever gets done. It's no wonder nothing ever gets delivered. It's no wonder it's so hard to build infrastructure. Every time you try you've got another layer of cultural law and green lawfare and minority groups that just want to stop everything.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a policy that we wanted to build dams. It was so difficult because the Commonwealth can't build dams without the say-so of the states. And it wasn't just the Labor states saying no; sometimes it was those states that were wearing our own political colours, political stripes, that made it so difficult to get on and build water infrastructure for flood regulations, to stop communities being flooded, but also to store water for valuable food and fibre production. And it shouldn't be so. I mean we're smarter than that—well, we should be!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is becoming so onerous on businesses, on ministers just to get something done. I do feel as though there is this insidious creep of more and more compliance. All too often ministers are being made to just comply with what the bureaucrats tell them is necessary, tell them is so. And look out if they don't, because they could potentially end up in the federal National Anti-Corruption Commission if they don't follow what the public servants, the bureaucracy, has told them must be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to protect the environment. There's absolutely no question about that. We haven't got a planet B at the moment, and I get the fact that we need to protect the planet, but we also need to protect people in jobs, we need to protect people who want to build things, we need to protect people who want to just live a commonsense life. And heaven help us if the Greens political party forms a power-sharing agreement with Labor after the next election! We've seen just this week the move to ban live sheep exports. We know that this is not an animal welfare thing. We know that this is not good for the environment. It's just bad for business, bad for Western Australia, bad for the agricultural industry full-stop. It's sad to say that the biggest budget expense for agriculture, for farming, in the federal budget handed down on 14 May was $107 million to stop farmers farming. That's a fact. So heaven forbid what is going to happen if the Greens are in a power-sharing arrangement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They have the Horse Racing Transition Taskforce that's going to coordinate and shut down the horseracing industry. Yes, let's go and do that! It only employs 70,000 people. It only engages with hundreds of millions of dollars back to mainly state coffers—but also in the form of federal taxes. It is one of our biggest industries, but, if the Greens get their opportunity, they will shut it down. It just doesn't make sense. This is where all this overregulation is headed. I was being facetious when I said, 'Yes, let's do that.' It is just getting too much.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then, of course, we had the Labor-Greens love-in with their agreement to strip water irrigation in the Murray-Darling Basin. That was where we had the budget come down with 'NFP' next to the amount the government will pay to buy back water, and 'buying back water' is code for those river communities which rely on irrigation to almost cease existence. Many of those communities were formed as part of the soldier settlement plan, certainly in the Mirrool district and the Griffith district in the southern and western Riverina areas. But they've been told that what they do is environmentally unsustainable. It's just like our farmers—the best stewards for the environment in the nation get told to stop farming. They get paid, incentivised, to do so. This is just a nonsense! The NFP I referred to in the budget papers is 'not for publication', so we don't know how much money the government is going to spend on stopping irrigation farmers from growing the food and fibre that is the best in the world. We need it here for domestic purposes. We need it for our exports, but not according to the government and certainly not according to the Greens. The government should realise this and put the Greens political party last on their how-to-vote cards. This legislation is absolute overreach. I wonder where it will all stop? We don't know because Labor and the Greens are always plotting against their natural enemies, which are our farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see in this place—and I know that the member for Parkes has often said it, and that member for Herbert here would agree with me too—is that we just get tired of getting lectured to by MPs who come in here and whose electorates are about as big as this. That's my handkerchief, for those who can't see this. They represent these all-holy, pure and pious people who don't understand that their food doesn't just come from the supermarket. It actually gets to the supermarket via trucks, and they're against them and against the drivers who drive them. It comes originally from a paddock. But they don't understand that, they just think it comes from the fridge at the supermarket.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government puts everything in place, this legislation included, to stop farmers doing what they do best. We have the best in the world, the best international practice, for growing the food and fibre that is second to none anywhere. I don't ever hear those opposite, and certainly those who sit on the crossbench, say thank you to our farmers: 'Thank you for doing what you do. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.' That's for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Without a farmer, that doesn't happen. We don't get food on the table. It's legislation such as this, with, 'Oh, yeah, let's just have more public servants.' How many did we get in the budget? Tens of thousands more.</span>
                </p>

                    </a>  And that's important, and I certainly take that interjection from the member for Gellibrand, the minister at the table opposite. Veterans are important, and I know we've introduced legislation today about veterans. No-one knows this more than the member for Herbert here, a fine veteran himself. I'm a former veterans' affairs minister, so I certainly don't need to be lectured to about how important our veterans are. We need to look after them. But we also need to look after those people who feed the veterans. Let me tell you a little fact: some of those veterans go on to become farmers once their uniformed service is over. Once they're done serving in our Air Force, our Army or our Navy, they actually go and take up the land—just like they did more than 100 years ago in Griffith, in Leeton, in Narrandera and in the Mirrool Creek area. But what are we doing? We're putting more legislation in to stop them doing what they're doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even in my own electorate, we've got Riverina landowners up in arms as destructive solar farms are taking valuable, vital, prime agricultural land to just cover them with solar panels. They say it's good for the sheep! Go figure: it's good for the sheep! It might be good for their leasing arrangements so that these Pitt Street farmers don't have to worry about the land for the next 10, 20 or 30 years, but, ultimately, those solar panels are going to have to be recycled, and at the moment we can't do that. They end up in landfill, and that's got to be bad for the environment. But, then again, we've got Greens political party Senator Mehreen Faruqi. The environment's all well and good until it comes to her own Port Macquarie property. She's planning to bulldoze dozens of trees to subdivide a Port Macquarie investment property into three luxury rentals.</span>

                    </a>  I hear the member for Herbert say, 'What?' They're well and good to come in here and lecturing about what's good for the environment, biodiversity, shutting down those terrible farmers who feed us three times a day and closing down the Murray-Darling Basin, but, when there are a few trees—I shouldn't say 'a few' as it's more than a few; it's dozens of trees—that's okay. They say, 'Let's just get the bulldozers in.' What's good for the goose has to be good for the gander, but I tell you what—how hypocritical is that! And they'll come in here—and she's one to talk. She tells us that all those terrible miners that we have in this country have caused the global warming in Pakistan. That's what she has said. That's what she is on the public record as having said. You can't make this stuff up.</span>

                    </a>  I can hear your incredulity, member for Herbert. It is right. This nature positive environmental bill is just another overreach; it's just more bureaucracy. I mean, we know where it starts, but the question is: where does it end? That is the major problem, and yet we've got a Labor government that is not actually doing all that well in the polls or anywhere else at the moment. The people out there are palpable with white-hot anger about how they've governed this nation, and if they lose enough seats and end up having to power share with the Greens after the election then God help Australia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  In Australia, we pride ourselves on having a pristine natural environment—from white sandy beaches to forests teeming with life and birdsong to the quiet power of our central desert. Our spiritual connection and economic dependency on nature are indisputable. More than half of Australia's GDP is moderately to highly dependent on nature, such as tourism, food production and, indeed, pharmaceuticals. Seventy per cent of our food is reliant on pollinators like bees, insects and bats. The economic argument I've outlined complements the spiritual fulfilment we derive from nature. Yet in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">state of the environment</span><span style="font-style:italic;">2021 </span>report, which the previous Liberal government suppressed, our environment was described as poor and deteriorating as a result of increasing pressures from climate change, habitat loss, invasive species and resource extraction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has one of the highest rates of species extinction, with more than 100 endemic species becoming extinct or extinct in the wild since colonial settlement, with scientists describing some of these extinctions as predictable and probably preventable. The facts are sobering. Australia has lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent. For the first time, Australia has more foreign plant species than native. Habitat the size of Tasmania has been cleared. Plastics are choking our oceans—up to 80,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometre. Flow in most Murray-Darling rivers has reached record low levels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Samuel review gave a devastating assessment of the EPBC Act, which we are now undertaking reform to. In April 2024, Professor Samuel described this act and its associated regulations as 'gobbledygook' and said the regulatory framework had been an abysmal failure at protecting our environment over the past 25 years. In response, our Nature Repair Market Bill, a world first, was passed at the end of last year, and it included expanding the water trigger to include unconventional gas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This second tranche of reform that I'm talking about now will establish the national Environment Protection Authority as a regulator and the Environment Information Australia as a harvester or gatherer of data and information, to be used in as close to real-time as possible to better inform our decision-making. This legislation package, including the Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024, aims to foster a sustainable future by enhancing environmental protection, improving information transparency and ensuring smooth transitions in regulatory frameworks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor government not only intends on repairing nature but making it Liberal proof. We intend on delivering a Nature Positive Australia, and we need to after a decade of energy chaos, climate denialism and the climate wars; it goes on and on. To that we can add the dereliction of duty with respect to the environment. Nature Positive means repairing nature to leave it in a better state than we found it in, going above and beyond the minimum of repairing loss alone. This will be the first time that any country has defined Nature Positive and introduces a requirement for Australia to progress towards that outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The EPA bill is the cornerstone of the Nature Positive legislation. It seeks to establish EPA, or Environment Protection Australia—an independent statutory body dedicated to enforcing and regulating environmental standards across the country. The creation of the EPA is a significant step towards ensuring that environmental protection is not only a priority but is also effectively monitored and enforced. The EPA will provide independent oversight, comprehensive environmental standards, public participation and transparency and enhanced monitoring and reporting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, we will fix our laws so they are less bureaucratic and provide more certainty for business. But we will also make sure that they improve nature, protect our unique native plants and animals and prevent extinctions. These are ambitious goals, but they have to be ambitious, given the scale of degradation that we are currently facing. The EPA would be a truly national environmental regulator that Australians can be proud of, responsible for a wide range of activities, including recycling, hazardous waste management, wildlife trade, sea dumping, ozone protection, underwater cultural heritage and air quality—one of my favourite topics. We are investing in our people, planning and systems to speed up development decisions, deliver quicker 'yeses' and, where necessary, deliver quicker 'noes'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An audit ordered last year by Minister Plibersek, who I commend for driving this legislation, found that around one-in-seven developments could be in breach of their offset conditions. That is where a business had not properly compensated for the impact a development was having on the environment. This is unacceptable. The EPA would be the tough cop on the beat, enforcing our laws through new monitoring, compliance and enforcement powers. The Samuel review into Australia's environmental laws found that the current regulator is not fulfilling this necessary function. Professor Samuel also found that serious enforcement actions are rarely used and that penalties need to be more than simply the cost of doing business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our bills respond to these deficiencies. That's why we are increasing penalties for serious breaches of federal environmental laws. Courts would be able to impose penalties of up to $780 million. The EPA will be able to issue environment protection orders or stop-work orders in order to prevent imminent, significant environmental risk or harm. The EPA would also be able to audit businesses to ensure they are compliant with environment approval conditions. The minister will retain the power to make decisions where they wish to do so and, in practice, will make decisions based on advice of the EPA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The EPA would work hand in glove with Environment Information Australia, or the EIA, as well as state and territory governments to enable better use of environmental data both in planning and decision-making. We recognise that informed decisions require reliable data. Centralised environmental information will help facilitate better decision-making. Achieving a Nature Positive Australia relies on good data and useful environmental information. This information will inform investment, policy and regulatory decisions by government, the private sector, community groups, academics, scientists and philanthropic groups. In other words, it's available for everyone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that national environment information and data is fragmented. Its quality is uncertain, and what is available is not readily accessible and usable. When businesses are more easily able to select sites which minimise impacts on nature, projects can be approved more easily and completed more quickly and save money, both for the taxpayer and for business. Legislating for independent, consistent and authoritative environmental reporting will mean that no Australian government can hide the truth about the state of the environment like the previous government did, to their enduring shame. The bill also provides more transparency of the critical information and data that underpin regulatory decision-making. This was a key recommendation of the Samuel review. It delivers on our promise at the last election to provide consistent and reliable information on the state of the environment across the country. This bill will require reports to be published online every two years instead of every five years. It will allow us to get on the front foot and better apply and track protections where they are most needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's environment is a national asset and responsibility. We are the stewards of our environment. This is why the state of the environment reports include a new requirement to report on the progress of the government's national environmental goals. The bill makes it a requirement for the government to commit publicly to national environmental goals. When Labor was first elected, Minister Plibersek released the official five-yearly report card on Australia's environment. This is known as the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">environment report</span>. The former government received it before Christmas 2021 but chose to keep it hidden, locked away in the back cupboard, until after the 2022 federal election because the findings were so damning. It was a distressing read, and it shows just how much damage a decade of Liberal and National Party neglect—in fact, ineptitude—did to our environment. The Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply this year stated that he would defund the Environmental Defenders Office and speed up approvals to unlock gas. Conspicuous was the absence of any mention of protecting the environment. That should send a shiver down the spine of every single Australian who enjoys recreating and travelling through this great land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, establishment of an EPA and EIA future-proofs our environment from bad governments and commercial overreach. Importantly, it has broad support across environment, business, farming and community groups. A few of these groups have put forward testimonials in support of this. Professor Graeme Samuel said: 'The government and the minister are doing everything exactly as they should be doing. I don't underestimate the complexity of what has to be done …' The ACF said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ACF welcomes the government's announcement that it will set up an agency to enforce environment laws—something previous governments failed to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the WWF, World Wildlife Fund, said, 'The EPA is a potential game changer.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By establishing robust regulatory frameworks, improving data accessibility and a ensuring smooth transition, the Albanese government's nature-positive plan sets the stage for a sustainable and resilient future. This legislation not only addresses current environmental challenges but also lays the foundation for long-term ecological health, economic prosperity and social wellbeing. It is a crucial step towards ensuring that Australia remains a vibrant, healthy and thriving nation for generations to come. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="300124" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TINK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  Australia's primary environmental law, the EPBC Act, is broken. The state of our environment is deteriorating, and right now this government has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to strengthen Australia's environmental framework. But the legislation before us today—the Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024, the Nature Positive (Environment Information Australia) Bill 2024 and the Nature Positive (Environment Law Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024—falls short of that opportunity, and it simply doesn't deliver on the promises made by the Labor Party during the 2022 election campaign. Back then, to win our confidence and many people's votes, the party promised to do three things: (1) fix the broken system; (2) end the extinction crisis; and (3) overhaul our broken environmental laws. Those promises may have been ambitious at the time, but many, including myself, expected to see them delivered. After all, a focused government can move mountains, as we have seen with the scale of the industrial relations reform this government has successfully pursued.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear, we need both a national environmental protection agency and a national agency to oversee the collection of environmental information. But while the pieces of legislation in front of us right now seek to establish those bodies, the lack of public participation and community consultation in them and the government's failure to progress the full reform agenda as promised in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature Positive </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Plan</span> is concerning. I'm also disappointed that, despite significant engagement with myself and others on the crossbench discussing amendments that may increase my community's confidence in the legislation, the minister has chosen to proceed without change. For this reason I support the crossbench senators who were able to refer the bills to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee last week, as I believe independent scrutiny of this legislation could make it stronger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I held a forum in North Sydney with representatives from five environmental organisations, for my community to hear from them directly on the progress of the environmental protection reform agenda. Sadly, there was broad consensus amongst the panellists that the current reforms do not live up to the government's commitment to end extinctions and rebuild public trust. The insightful questions asked by the audience that night and the discussions I had with community members both before and after the panel made it clear that there is still a trust deficit when it comes to environmental decision-making in this country, and people do not doubt that the current legal system designed to protect our environment is broken. This government has made much of the 2021 <span style="font-style:italic;">State of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report, which told us of the condition of rivers, reefs, wetlands, soil, native vegetation and biodiversity and its continued decline at a terrifying rate, whilst the list of plant and animal species identified as threatened or endangered has been lengthening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has lost more mammal species than any other continent. It has one of the highest rates of species decline in the developed world and is the only developed country that is a deforestation hot spot. Meanwhile, climate change is compounding damage from deforestation, invasive species pollution and urban expansion, and this poor environmental scorecard is arguably only being enabled by our broken Commonwealth environmental law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Samuel's scathing review of the Howard-era EPBC Act painted a dire picture of a dysfunctional legal framework lacking integrity and a need of fundamental reform. Professor Samuel found that the lack of public trust in the act's ability to protect nature stems from poor transparency, inadequate opportunities for community participation in decision-making and approval processes, limited pathways for legal review and perceptions of poor accountability for government decisions. Yet, two years into a three-year term, we have seen no significant improvements in any of those areas from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022 the Albanese government released the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature Positive Plan</span>, articulating its commitment to reform Australia's environmental laws. The plan was ambitious but nothing more than what was necessary. Late last year, the government introduced the first stage of reform legislating the nature repair market and expanding the water trigger in the EPBC Act. At that time I expressed concerns we were putting the cart before the horse, building a mechanism that allowed those that wished to destroy to simply pay their way out of it. The minister assured my community that my concern was not warranted, that the national protection standards would be in place before the market came into effect. Then, in April this year, the environment minister announced the nature-positive reforms would not proceed as planned but, rather, would move forward in a slower, staged manner. Concerningly, we now don't have a definitive timeline for the delivery of the one thing that absolutely underpins all this reform—the new national standards. It seems this government has overpromised and will now underdeliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Establishing the EPA and the EIA were identified as two priorities within the government's nature-positive reforms, but, as they exist in the current legislation, many, including myself, are concerned they do not meet the ambition originally promised. Many of the objects, functions and duties of the EPA in relation to public participation, transparency of decisions and accountability in government's mechanisms are not included in this overriding governing legislation. As a result, with an election due in the next 10 months my community is concerned the next critical stage of the nature-positive reforms will not be delivered. That would leave us with flaccid agencies that are as impotent as the laws they are tasked with enforcing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With significant aspects of the nature reform package relegated to stage 3 with no due date, the new tough cop on the beat, the EPA, will be a rookie cop, enforcing the same, weak, out-of-date laws. I acknowledge that the Samuel report recommended a staged approach to the nature-positive reforms and that Professor Samuel has, himself, supported the minister in the approach the government is taking. Even so, I remain concerned that if this government fails to deliver all three stages in this parliamentary term, the reform to date could be wasted. Two years was long enough for this government to deliver the most significant industrial relations reform this country has seen in decades. Two years should have been long enough to also get this work done if it had been prioritised to the same extent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll speak now to the specifics of the bills. The Nature Positive (Environment Information Australia) Bill 2024 establishes the head of Environment Information Australia, setting out their functions, including preparing a reporting framework and state of the environment reports, maintaining environmental economic accounts and identifying national environmental information assets. Looking at it in isolation, I'm broadly comfortable with it. The second piece of legislation, the Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024, establishes a statutory agency to be known as Environment Protection Australia, and it's that bill and the Nature Positive (Environment Law Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 that I want to focus on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature-positive plan promised an independent EPA would be established to undertake regulatory and implementation functions under the EPBC Act and other relevant Commonwealth laws. Within that context it's arguable that independence and trust will be predicated on access to information and meaningful consultation to ensure transparency, accountability and integrity in environmental decision-making. Therefore, these principles should be at the heart of the EPA and be present in the primary legislation, yet they are not there currently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent Narrabri gas project in the Pilliga Forest provides a great example of what can and will go wrong when meaningful consultation is not at the centre of project development. This project, which involves drilling 850 gas wells over a thousand hectares of land in a project site that covers two-thirds of the Pilliga Forest and overlies part of the Great Artesian Basin, is close to my home town of Coonabarabran. Given this, I can attest to the fact that, as the largest native forest west of the Great Dividing Range, the Pilliga is a beautiful place to visit. Importantly, it's home to several threatened species, including the koala, the Pilliga mouse, the regent honeyeater, the superb parrot, the spotted-tail quoll, the south-eastern long-eared bat and the swift parrot.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this was proposed, a phenomenal 23,000 submissions were made, with 98 per cent opposing the project. However, the then environment minister's statement of reasons for approving the project only addressed public submissions in five of 670 paragraphs, and the community got no explanation of how their submissions had been considered in coming to the final decision. That says everything that needs to be said about how broken this current system is. Under it, ministers can tick the consultation box, but that doesn't mean they have meaningfully engaged with the community. Rather, meaningful public participation occurs when a decision-maker engages genuinely with public feedback, uses it when coming to their decision and explains to the public with full transparency how they got to the final decision. To not have those requirements in this primary piece of legislation seems to make it fundamentally flawed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Genuine consultation should be understood as, at a minimum, the decision maker's duty to respond to the substantive concerns and arguments put forward in the public submissions process. As Professor Samuel said himself:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Effective, outcomes-based decision-making, where the community can engage with the process and understand the reasons for decisions, is the primary way to improve trust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leaving consultation to matters of policy and giving proponents the power to control if, how and when that consultation happens is not in the spirit of the recommendations, observations or calls to date. The regulator should have the responsibility to ensure access to information and meaningful consultation, and the time to ensure that responsibility is now when the legislation is before us to establish the EPA. That's why we'll be proposing amendments to bring this level of responsibility, integrity and accountability into the EPA through this bill before us. Ultimately, the fix is not hard. It simply requires the bill to be strengthened to ensure the EPA is responsible for community access to information about proposed developments and that the community has an adequate opportunity and timeframe to express their views. As it currently stands, this is not the case. That responsibility is delegated to project proponents. I've got to say, that's a bit like putting the cat in charge of the milk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are several other elements of this bill that I believe should be improved. They include the governance model of the EPA, which many in my community currently believe is inadequate. As the agency will be established as a single-member regulator, the legislation does not allow for a statutory board to provide independent guidance or strategic direction to the EPA CEO. Rather, an advisory group will provide expert advice to that person to support decision-making. However, as it's currently drafted, both the make-up of and the advice received from the advisory group will be opaque. This risks enabling politicisation or conflicts of interest, but could be easily fixed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the EPA's objects and CEO's functions are currently nondescript and do not reference several important concepts, including community rights and climate change. Again, these could be easily addressed, were the legislation to be amended to include clearer objectives and duties to the public, including the provision of information about proposed actions and a responsibility to ensure meaningful consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, unlike many state EPAs, the national EPA is currently not required to develop or implement a charter of consultation, and this is more than a little concerning, given it's a break with current best practice. A charter of consultation would assist in ensuring the EPA has clear functions relating to community consultation from its inception, and it's critically important given the proposed community engagement and consultation standard will not be implemented until stage 3.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the bill provides for information about decisions to be published on a register, it is silent as to the level of transparency required, and again I think this is a missed opportunity. Best practice is to ensure crucial concepts are defined and contained in primary legislation, and I urge the minister and her team to please ensure that is the case here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, it's unarguable that climate change is the biggest threat to our environment, yet climate considerations are not currently integrated into our national environmental framework, nor is it proposed that they be under this new legislation. Now, many on the crossbench have already spoken to this, so I simply want to echo their calls. While the argument against including climate change in this legislation has been that it is best covered by the safeguard mechanism, I'd suggest that an issue as large as climate change should be referenced across multiple legislative instruments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, enabling these improvements to the EPA falls squarely within the scope of stage 2 of the nature-positive reforms, and I continue to encourage the minister and her team to seriously consider adopting some of the suggested amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong, independent environmental regulator is in the best interests of everyone, as not only will it reassure the public but it will also act as a second point of reference or support for projects the government wishes to see proceed. For example, just this past week, the government approved gas expansion plans in the Surat basin that will see more than 120 new gas wells developed out to 2080. That announcement follows the recent gas strategy that was also announced by this government, and consequently many across my community are concerned that the government is pursuing an agenda which is contrary to achieving our net zero target. The presence and input of a strong, independent, community minded EPA that is obliged to prioritise community voices would go a long way to reassuring the community in circumstances exactly like the two I've just spoken about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I recognise that the establishment of the EPA and the EIA is important, and it's important to ensure the bureaucracy is put in place as soon as practicable. I also recognise that Professor Samuel himself has supported a staged approach. Yet there are serious deficits in the bills before us, particularly when it comes to acknowledging a bureaucracy's responsibility to the community it serves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I remain extremely concerned that tranche 3, including the national environmental standards, may never happen. Fixing our broken system and restoring nature won't be possible without substantive legislative reform that has nature protection, community consultation and integrity at its heart. And no member of the government or any political party should ever assume they have another term to get essential work done. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion mirrors the motion that was moved and agreed to in the Senate on Monday, and I want to be crystal about this: Labor's position on this motion is very clear. We supported that motion that was agreed to by the Senate on Monday. On Tuesday the Prime Minister spoke about this very issue, condemning these acts in question time, and his comments were endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition at that time. The member for Spence also spoke in this place yesterday condemning this vandalism, and I spoke in relation to an attempt to suspend standing orders by the opposition, also condemning these acts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unfortunate, however, that the opposition attempted to politicise this matter by trying to proceed in moving a motion without notice to the government, where, if they had proceeded according to the normal form of this House, we could have dealt with this matter without adjournments earlier. I will say, also, that I would have thought that the content of the motion before the House today, as it was before the Senate on Monday, is a position that would have been agreeable not only to all members of the House but to all members and parties in the Senate. I think it is grossly unfortunate—and, in fact, abhorrent—that the Greens political party decided to vote against this motion in the Senate, because, as the motion says, what has occurred here 'undermines the significance of these memorials as symbols of national pride and remembrance'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The starting place has to be: what are these memorials? These memorials are the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, the centre of our commemorative activity as a nation; they are memorials to particular conflicts and service that line Anzac Parade, such as the Korean War Memorial and the Vietnam War Memorial; they are the memorials that are dotted around our country in communities, in cities, in towns and in rural and regional areas; and they are the commemorative gates or plaques at schools. Our country is covered in memorials. Why is that? It's because we as a nation respect and honour those people that have put on our nation's uniform, those that have made the ultimate sacrifice, and those that have fought on our behalf. The names of members of our community are on these memorials, as they are on the Australian War Memorial. They are the names of the sons that went off to war. They are the names of families, so prominent in those communities that suffered such great loss, whether they be the children, the partners, the brothers or the sisters of those people left in those communities to mourn. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we think about what it is that's being commemorated in that service, it's a dedication to our nation, and it is a dedication to the ideals and values of our nation—ideals and values that these people have fought to protect. Core to that is the concept and the actuality that is our democracy: a democracy that doesn't just happen in this place, in our parliament, but a democracy that happens in the living rooms, in the town halls, in the local government council chambers, in our state parliaments, and even on our streets. It is a freedom that comes with our democracy that allows people to protest, to express their views freely, and, yet, what has happened here is that protesters have decided to abuse that freedom, to undermine the memorials that stand for the people who actually fought to protect those freedoms in the first place. That is what is so abhorrent about what has happened not just on Sunday here in Canberra, not just what happened a month or so ago in similar places but what has also occurred in local memorials around our country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to speak to the arguments being run by those protesters or the things that they scrawled across those memorials because I don't want to amplify their message, because we condemn what they have done. We stand, I think, together in this place in condemning that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I endorse the comments that were made previously in this place by the Prime Minister and the member for Spence and the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Canning and the member for New England and others who have spoken in relation to this issue in this chamber, as well as in the Senate. What is really important here is that, in coming together today in this House of Representatives to debate this motion, we have an opportunity to be very clear not just to the Australian people at large but especially to those people who think that what they have done is in any way appropriate that we as a nation regard these places as sacred, as special because of the values that they represent for us as a nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These memorials not only commemorate individuals and our Defence Force at large but they also commemorate the values that those people fought for, put on a uniform to protect. Indeed, in some cases, they are memorials that commemorate wars that at the time were politically contested but, as a nation, regardless of that particular contest as to the engagement in those conflicts, we have all come together to recognise the sacrifice, to recognise the commitment of those people that put on our uniform, as we continue to do through to this day. It is why we don't just have those memorials and ignore them. It is why we come at the dawn on Anzac Day. It is why at 11 o'clock on 11 November every year we have silence. It is why we have special days of commemoration throughout the year like Vietnam Veterans Day. Because we recognise that service. We recognise that sacrifice. We recognise that loss. We talk about those that may be feeling absolutely a sense of loss in other parts of the world right now and we understand that. But we also recognise the sense of loss in communities felt by families, by wives and husbands, by children and parents, by nephews, by cousins—a hole that will never be filled, that will never be replaced. In fact, a new memorial was recently dedicated at the Australian War Memorial. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those who have brought home the scars of conflict and war, to those who feel the suffering of their loved one who wore the uniform and have had to support them, whether that is from active conflict or from any part of their service, that is what these memorials stand for, individually and collectively, and it is why they hold such a sacred place in our community. It is why we regard them with reverence, it is why we gather at them at multiple times throughout the year and it is why we do well to remember their significance, not just for the individuals they represent but for the values of our nation, and how doing damage to these places undermines the very values for which they stand and for which these people fought and wore a uniform. We all collectively agree that the individuals involved in these acts, these senseless acts of graffiti, of damage, will feel the full force of the law coming at them—if anyone is ever caught doing these things. Because that is a reflection not just of the law but of the values of this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the motion being passed today—as I expect it will be—as it was passed in the Senate earlier this week, rings as a clarion bell throughout our country for not just what our lawmakers feel about this issue but how our entire community feels about any denigration ever being made of any of our war memorials and places of commemoration in this nation. For that reason, I commend this motion to the House and look forward to full agreement to it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  In the gallery, I'm looking at some young Australians—young children that have come in from their school. I extend a very warm welcome to you. I want to say to you kids today up there in the gallery that you are part of the greatest nation on the planet. The future that you will enjoy and the potential in front of you is better by far than in any other country in the world. One day, one of you may be down here as the Prime Minister, and it is indeed a great democracy when we can see that in action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You will notice, kids, that at the four corners of this chamber is the Australian national flag, and it's a very important symbol. It symbolises our country and our democracy. It is also representative of the democratic power that we have as a Defence Force. Our soldiers, our sailors and our aviators wear that on our uniform. We swear an oath under that flag to protect that flag and our country, and it's something that we as a country are extraordinarily proud of, and so should you be. It adorns the coffins of our dead—those brave men and women who die to defend our country. We adorn their coffins with that flag because of its significance. It means something. It is more than just a rag on a pole. It symbolises our country. And so too our war memorials symbolise the sacrifice that goes with the defence of this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When a young Australian—maybe you later on; who knows—stands and swears an oath to Australia, its people, its government and our King, then you take on that onus as a member of the Defence Force. You will give your life in an instant for your country and your colleague on your right or your left. You do that because you are there to protect the democracy and the defence of this country. It's a very important thing. When we do lose members of our Defence Force, that flag is also significant, and it goes with the death and the life of that person—that brave young Australian. On Remembrance Day and Anzac Day, we normally adorn our monuments around the country, as the minister has reminded us, with the Australian national flag.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our memorials represent those young Australians who have given their lives to defend this country. They are sacred. It means more than anything else in the world. It's about those families that give up their loved ones—their brothers, their sisters, their sons, their daughters, their fathers and their mothers. That flag and those memorials mean everything. When we see them graffitied, walked upon and painted with terrible, terrible slogans, this is an indictment not only on those memorials, war dead and families but on the democracy of Australia itself. We cannot take a step back. We cannot flinch. We cannot hesitate in sticking up and standing for democracy and the protection of those monuments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll take you back to what it is like to be a soldier. If we hesitate on the battlefield for one split second, that will maybe mean not only my death but also the death of my colleague on my right or left. We do not hesitate. We remain clear eyed, mission focused and absolutely steadfast in the defence of this country. I cannot condemn this enough. I have been to Israel. I have been to Gaza. I have been in the Middle East. I have been on operations. And I cannot stress enough how important this is not only for our generation but for that beautiful generation I see up there in the gallery. You be proud of being Australian. You be proud of our flag and you be proud of all those who defend it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  I hope that this House condemns in the strongest terms the act of defacing our war memorials, here in Canberra and anywhere else, by pro-Palestinian protesters. It is deeply insulting for veterans and current members of the Australian Defence Force and for others that have put their life on the line, including the Australian Federal Police, to do the work that must be done to protect the sovereignty of our nation and our democracy. It undermines the significance of these memorials, which are symbols of national pride and remembrance, when such actions are taken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard on the weekend—I think it was on Sunday—about the defacing of the Vietnam and Korea war memorials. On the way into this place, very early on Monday morning, I stopped by to see it with my own eyes. I could not believe that it had happened, but it had. Like other speakers, I won't give those messages any more oxygen, but it was an abhorrent thing to see, knowing the sacrifices of those that have given so much for our nation—their lives—but also the effect that has had on their families and those that came back from defending Australia. We owe them everything. We owe them our freedoms, our very lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was with great disgust that I saw the damage to the Vietnam War memorial, given all that my father and his mates went through to do their bit to represent our country and serve our nation. Just before I came down here to the chamber, I received a call from John Haward—not that one, a different one—the president of the Box Hill RSL. John is a great man. I met him in Vietnam, and I gave him a dink on my motorbike out to the Long Tan cross. It was a magic experience to be there in the rubber plantation, as I'm sure those who have been there would agree, and see the Long Tan cross. It's so moving because you realise how lonely former generations of soldiers, sailors and airmen would have felt at times. They had their mates with them, but at times they would have thought, 'I'm so far away from home, and this is a really dangerous place.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at the Vietnam memorial with dad and his mates when it was opened, and it was such a healing thing for them. For some idiot, some scumbag, to deface that is just totally disgusting. What John wanted to pass on to me was that he appreciated my words. The first thing I did when I got up to this place was speak to the media and say how disgusted I was at that. John had heard that, so he gave me a call to say, 'Thanks, mate.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Korean War veterans—we think Canberra gets cold—how cold and difficult that operating environment must have been. Again, men and women of the Australian Defence Force served us in places like Korea. For someone to deface that memorial, given so many Australians died, is deplorable. The other thing that's deplorable is the Greens political party, because they do nothing but protest. They do nothing but grandstand. For them to suggest that in some way spray-painting a war memorial anywhere is freedom of speech is just so disgusting and so out of step with mainstream Australia. I just want all the veterans and their family members out there to know that we back you every day.</span>

He was killed flying off the coast of the Northern Territory in a Hudson bomber, exactly the same aircraft you see on static display in Canberra.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's just one example of the 103,000 men and women who, over a hundred years, have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country and laid down their lives. There is a debt of gratitude that we in this generation will never fully repay; nor will we ever really comprehend or understand the scale of human tragedy that has gone before us in two world wars. And I pray that we never have to.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen in the last few months, and, in particular, what we saw at the Australian War Memorial a month or so ago and then what we saw just on Sunday with the war memorials that line Anzac Parade in Canberra, is an absolute travesty. It is a tragedy. No words can describe how everyday Australians feel about the actions of these Palestinian protesters. They're not activists; they are criminals. We shouldn't refer to them as activists, as though we somehow hold them in some high esteem. They are criminals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To deface, in such a shocking way, the memorials that this country holds dear can never be forgiven. To see Senator Jordon Steele-John talk about this as somehow being an act of free speech is an absolute disgrace, and it says more about him and the Greens political party, their ideals and their beliefs than it does about everybody else who doesn't support the Greens—the other 90 per cent of Australians. I don't really want to make this a political statement, but can I implore anybody who, at the next federal election, is going to walk into the booth and come up to the ballot box entertaining the thought of giving a vote to the Greens to stop just for a moment and think about what the Greens stand for. Stop and think about this week. Stop and think that you might be considering voting for a party that stands for everything that most common and decent Australians would find abhorrent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are no longer the party of conservationists. They are a party of reckless indifference to the traditions that have held this country together for so long. They are wreckers. They are spoilers. They're not the Bob Brown party of yesteryear. They are a party of anarchists. Do not put your name down to be associated with these people. They deserve nothing other than our condemnation. I call upon every single good-minded, fair Australian to stand with me, to stand with members present and to condemn the Greens. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  'All that is left is their name on that memorial.' These were some of the many fine words spoken by the member for New England yesterday. It was significant because he spoke not to the names but to the people behind those names—the people that they represent in each of our towns around the country. The member for Canning spoke to some 4,000 to 5,000 memorials and 103,000 people that died on the roll call. The reasons for which they died were different conflicts. This is not the time to ponder why they went. Instead, it's to consider the reality that they did. And then they died for it. What we have left are memorials around the country. I've got so many memorials in my own electorate, and they represent ordinary people who came off the farms to go and fight. We've also got soldiers, from Chidlow to Guildford, who were awarded the VC. We do the most to recognise that because many of their families never even had their bodies returned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for New England spoke to, that brass name is all that's left for a family to walk to, to reflect upon and to remember. So for the Greens' Western Australian Senator Steele-John to say that these are not politically neutral spaces is wrong. These are the equivalents of gravesites. This is not a place to get political. This is purely to remember the individuals who gave their lives in our name. It is absolutely shocking to hear of past events that the member for Burt has referred to, the desecration of the war memorials. It is not just here in Canberra, where we saw everything from red dye being spilt into the reflection pool and different memorials for Vietnam, Korea, World War I and World War II being desecrated with slogans; what is also absolutely shocking are the terms in which it's been done. If vandalism, as Senator Steele-John and the member for Melbourne seem to believe, is a part of freedom of expression, then we will have no safe way of commemorating anything—no safe way to respect the fallen, no safe way to pay homage to those whose sacrifices have, in fact, enabled the Greens to stand here in this parliament and spout those ugly sentiments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We often say in this place that the standard we walk past is the standard we accept. The vandalism that a member of parliament won't call out is the vandalism that that member, by omission or otherwise, actually endorses. I don't see Senator Steele-John out there with a paintbrush, nor do I see the member for Melbourne with one. But the fact that they are not out there with a spray can is inconsequential. It's the fact that they are actively encouraging it that needs to be called out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just them. I know that there are WhatsApp groups, Signal groups and people organising themselves around the country to be able to demonstrate their frustration and their anger about what's happening in the Middle East. I get that and I respect that because we all feel the same frustration. We all feel concern for the absolute catastrophe that is happening before our eyes. We're seeing tens of thousands, up to 40,000 people, now dead in Gaza alone. But this is not a reason to then turn on our fallen and desecrate their names for a cause that they have nothing to do with. That completely detracts from what they died for. This is not the time. It's not the place. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many other ways in which to conduct peaceful protest, and I call upon those who are community leaders, who are rallying people around them, to demonstrate their anger and what change they would like to see. But I especially call on people in this House and in the Senate, from the Greens, who are actively not condemning these acts, to stand up for what is actually right and the peaceful way of expressing our democratic right to protest. To all the veterans back in my electorate of Hasluck, I'm sorry for what has unfolded. I'm sorry for what you must be experiencing. Particularly those from the Vietnam War, who have always felt that they've been treated differently, I'm sorry again.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment and Water</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  I want to thank all members in this place who have spoken on these three bills, including the Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024. Australians care about and want to protect our environment. Our economy, our livelihood, our wellbeing and the wellbeing of future generations all depend on the health of our natural world. Australians want a country where nature is being repaired, where it's regenerating and where we have stopped the decline and begun to turn around the damage of the past. Australians want a nature positive Australia. That's what the community expects, and that's what we are delivering through the reforms outlined in our Nature Positive Plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With these bills—the second stage of the nature positive reforms—we're moving quickly to establish the institutions that will be crucial to creating a nature positive Australia. Our bills would establish Environment Protection Australia, our EPA, and define statutory functions for the head of Environment Information Australia. We are creating Australia's first national, independent environment protection agency with strong new powers and penalties to better protect nature. EPA will deliver proportionate and effective risk-based compliance and enforcement actions using high-quality data and information. It will provide assurance that environmental outcomes are being met. Promoting public trust in environmental decision-making through the publication of information and the transparency of decisions will be core to EPA's business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The head of Environment Information Australia will be an independent position with a legislative mandate to transparently report on trends in the environment and on the state of the environment report every two years. The head of Environment Information Australia will work in collaboration with Australia's experts, scientists and First Nations people to collect more high-quality information and make that information easier to access. This will support actions and decisions to halt and reverse the decline of and in turn protect and restore nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Positive (Environment Information Australia) Bill would also make Australia the first country in the world to define the term 'nature positive' in legislation and introduce a requirement to report on national progress towards that outcome. This would be measured from a national baseline that the head of Environment Information Australia will independently set together with relevant experts. This will create accountability for our collective national efforts to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030, as we've committed to under the Convention on Biological Diversity's global biodiversity framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This stage of the reform, together with significant additional government investment, will deliver stronger environmental powers, faster environmental approvals, more environmental information and greater transparency. We will keep working with individuals and groups on the remainder of our reforms outlined in the Nature Positive Plan so that we can get them into the parliament and passed. The third stage of nature positive reforms will continue our broader efforts to halt and reverse environmental decline, protect nature and create a nature positive Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The choices before the parliament today are very clear: Do you want an independent Environment Protection Agency or not? Do you want better data to inform environmental decisions or not? Do you want tougher penalties for those breaking environmental laws or not? Do you want Australia to be the first jurisdiction in the world to enshrine a definition of 'nature positive' in legislation or not? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that we are shortly to move to the consideration in detail stage of this legislative package. I know that a number of members on the crossbench will be moving amendments. It isn't our proposal to accept those amendments today and I will speak in the consideration in detail stage about the specific reasons for that. I also look forward to the inquiry that the Senate Environment and Communications committee will undertake on this legislation. I will certainly consider the recommendations of that committee and continue to engage with the crossbench as these bills continue their way through the parliament. </span>

To have that opportunity, the public need reasonable timeframes to allow them to access relevant information and prepare and participate effectively during environmental decision-making.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, sections of the EPBC Act which relate to public comment are short and often prohibitive to the participation of many interested parties. For example, at the referral stage, the timeframe for public engagement is just 10 days. At the assessment approach stage, depending on the assessment approach chosen, public engagement is required either for a timeframe specified by the minister or for a period of 10 days. In small or remote communities, individuals often hear about consultation opportunities via word-of-mouth. By the time they're aware of the project proposal, the opportunity to engage is small, and the consultation window is often closing. Add to this the difficulties of engaging in a consultation that occurs during school holidays or festive periods, and the argument to extend these consultation windows becomes even more compelling.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own home community of Coonabarabran in Northern New South Wales, community consultation around a new gas project opened a week immediately preceding Christmas to then close only within the first weeks of January. I know this because I was at home at the time, and I saw the distress this created across the community. Here, you can see how short consultation timeframes can be abused. This amendment would extend the minimum timeframe for public comment under the EPBC Act to 40 days in accordance with internationally recognised guidelines that stipulate consultation should involve reasonable timeframes that allow the public to participate effectively in environmental decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The public's right to be consulted about environmental decisions is one of three access rights established under the United Nations Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, to which Australia is a signatory. Australia is also a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which enshrines the human rights to seek and receive information, public participation and remedy for rights violations, all of which apply in the context of environmental decision-making.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Genuine public participation fulfils fundamental democratic rights and improves the quality of decision-making by integrating additional knowledge and perspectives into deliberations. Put simply, when communities are given a fair go in the way a decision is made, in the decision-making process, including adequate consultation timeframes, there are better outcomes for people and nature. I commend my amendments to the government.</span>

She has just spoken about a whole set of amendments that relate to both the Environment Protection Australia legislation and the transitional amendments legislation, if I understand her correctly. I will make a few comments in response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, I'm very grateful to the member for North Sydney for moving her amendments. I thank her for her longstanding and constructive engagement with me and my office. I know she is absolutely steadfast in her commitment to build public trust in our environmental regulations and has been a very effective advocate for the people of North Sydney. The government won't be supporting these amendments, however, but I completely understand the member's intent in moving the amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the public confidence that our environmental laws are being upheld is just one of the reasons I'm trying to set up Australia's first national independent environment protection agency. Environment Protection Australia is designed to be a tough cop on the beat, with enforcement and compliance powers to ensure our laws are being upheld. The EPA will have oversight and enforcement powers to crack down on those breaching our laws or failing to comply with the conditions of their approval. The EPA will be empowered to issue environment protection orders. These are stop-work orders where they believe there may be noncompliance. There will also be very substantial fines for breaches.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the objects of the act that some of the other amendments go to, it is important to draw the distinction between the objects of the legislation which administers the EPA and the objects of the acts which the EPA will regulate. The EPA will be responsible for regulating nine other pieces of legislation. We cannot support the member's amendments because the scope of the bill is about establishing the EPA with the environmental objectives resting in the regulated acts like the EPBC Act, the ozone protection act or the Underwater Cultural Heritage Act. Each of those acts has its own objects. We don't believe the agency which administers these acts with their own objectives should have an additional layer of objectives beyond those already included. These already achieve what the member is looking to do, which is to promote public trust in decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The object of the EPA bill is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to establish Environment Protection Australia to support the delivery of accountable, efficient, outcomes-focused and transparent environmental regulatory decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I thank the member for moving this amendment and acknowledge her dedication to her community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issues relating to extending the public-comment period to 40 business days, which the member has also alluded to: I particularly agree with her that it is important that the public has enough time to properly engage in consultation processes on environmental matters that affect them. That's why one of the national environmental standards I'm currently consulting on will be a specific standard addressing community consultation and engagement. One of the main objectives will be to make sure that communities are properly consulted, and consulted early, so they have genuine opportunity to influence the location and the design of projects. I look forward to continuing to discuss this with the member for North Sydney. It's crucial the public get the information they need in the time they need, but I won't be supporting this amendment—because the amendment is so very broad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposal to change the timeframes, including for things like wildlife permits, proclamations, management plans and environmental assessments, would lead to some perverse outcomes. For example, the risk of extending all these to 40 days would have had a consequence in one example that has been on my desk recently: there was a captive-bred cheetah called Edie being returned to the wild in Africa. If we hadn't been able to quickly tick off on the export permit for that, Edie would have missed her spot on the Qantas jet that had been booked to take her to where she was being released into the wild. I want to avoid any unintended consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finalise my comments on this by saying that, with the publishing of advice of the advisory group, the CEO already may publish the advice from the advisory group. I think that strikes a balance between allowing—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I rise to speak on behalf of residents from Bundeena and Maianbar about the woeful telecommunications infrastructure in these areas. These are beautiful beachside villages bound by the Royal National Park and the Port Hacking river, home to around 2½ thousand local residents. I mention the work particularly of the Bundeena Progress Association in advocating for these residents. This area also is frequented by tourists, budding artists and thousands of bushwalkers. It is very disappointing to see that the Bundeena and Maianbar communities continue to be ignored by this Labor government, particularly in relation to mobile phone coverage.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Services are provided by towers in Cronulla. These towers are approximately three kilometres away, over the Port Hacking river. This is a major problem for a community that is geographically isolated and prone to natural disasters such as bushfires and flooding. Disappointingly, Bundeena was again overlooked in the latest round of funding from the government's Mobile Black Spot Program.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, with the internet connection, I have been writing to the minister about the need to upgrade the fibre-to-the-curb connection, which Bundeena residents have been waiting for now for more than six years. I still have not heard from the Minister for Communications on this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a community that desperately needs the same level of mobile and internet service enjoyed by most other Australians. The Labor government needs to do better for the residents of Bundeena and Maianbar.

Since we made the largest cut to the co-payment on scripts in Australia's history, Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury residents have saved more than $2 million on their scripts. That is 170,000 cheaper prescriptions. Our freeze on the cost of PBS medications means those savings will continue for the next year, and for pension the savings continue for the next five years. Since doctors could write and chemists could dispense two scrips for the price of one, 24,000 60-day scripts have been dispensed, saving people time and money.</span>

We're also seeing an increase in GP bulk-billing in Macquarie, with the decline in bulk-billing turning around and an increase happening with more than 84 per cent of GP visits bulk-billed. That's above the state and national average. The Albanese Labor government is the party of Medicare, and we're strengthening Medicare, making it easier for Macquarie residents to get the care they need and saving them millions of dollars on cheaper medicines and free bulk billed visits to the GP.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  The government is prioritising the delivery of cost-of-living relief. This is reflected in the measures that came into effect on 1 July, including tax cuts, cheaper medicines, rent relief and the energy rebate. One of the key elements is reversing a decade of anaemic wages growth; indeed, it is one of the worst decades on record. Minimum wages grew 3.75 per cent on 1 July. This will benefit 2.6 million people, and, when we combine the wage rise with the tax cuts, a minimum wage earner will receive at least $38 more in their bank account per week. This is material, meaningful and much-needed relief. If you're a cleaner or a retail worker, $40 more will be going into your account every week because of the pay rise coupled with the tax cut. After a decade of wages being kept deliberately low by those opposite, workers who often perform important, difficult and unrecognised jobs in our society are finally getting some recognition and are finally getting a fairer share.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the election campaign, those opposite acted as if the economy would crash if there were reasonable wages growth. Minimum wage workers aren't the only ones seeing a pay rise. The 360,000 truck drivers and transport workers on enterprise agreements will see $75 extra in their accounts. What all of this means is that those workers on minimum wages in Australia, and more broadly across our economy, will earn more and they will also keep more of what they earn.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  With millions of Australians struggling to keep a secure and affordable roof over their heads, there's no doubt we're in a housing crisis. And nowhere is this more apparent than in a Tasmanian winter. Indeed, with winter temperatures in Tasmanian homes averaging as low as 10 degrees, according to one study, it can be even worse for the tens of thousands of Tasmanians shivering through winter in poorly maintained social and private rentals. And of course let's not forget the more than 2,300 Tasmanians experiencing homelessness, who, all too often, only have a tent flap between them and the cold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, there's lots of noise from the federal government about doubling housing and homelessness funding in the budget, but the reality is that the funding for Tasmania will in fact decline this year under the National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness, from $38.1 million to $37.4 million, which is shocking in itself. But it's all the more worrisome considering the Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness is a Tasmanian. Surely the minister must have seen the desperate need in our state. Surely her office has been continually contacted by constituents desperate for a place to live. My office sure has been. No wonder the community is looking to the government to do much more, especially in Tasmania, where the housing crisis is staring us in the face every day.</span>

They account for nearly $400,000 million of our $500,000 million. But on the next line are aluminium, beef and gold. If this parliament fools around with the live cattle trade and cuts off the source of food to Indonesia—our biggest neighbour, with 260 million people—and if a tiny bunch of Europeans living in Asia tell them they can't have food, the ramifications will be very serious indeed. Whilst there may be some 'wokies' in here who indulge their weird ideologies, this is an issue of food for people in a place where a lot of people go to bed hungry every night. All I can say is that, when we cut off the live cattle exports to Indonesia, they could not afford to buy processed meat. They have to process it themselves. When that trade was cut off by Julia Gillard, within two months she was gone. She was gone as a result of that decision, and Indonesia cut off all trade with Australia. This is very serious indeed. They will justify it in their aggression towards Australia—</span>

All up, they'll save some $1,800 across this year. An electrician working on construction sites in Phillip earning $110,000 will save more than $2,400 a year. That's because, this week, every Australian taxpayer got a tax cut. But that's not the only change that's occurred this week. This week, full-time national minimum wage earners in Australia will see their base pay increase by over $1,700 for this year. Some 2.6 million workers across the country will directly benefit from this increase. As someone that used to be involved in wage case submissions and enterprise bargaining, I know the difference it makes when you have a government that supports fair pay, rather than one that deliberately undermines pay and conditions for Australian workers and their families.</span>

There have been massive price increases for the NBN, and they have happened with two price increases in just eight months. The Minister for Communications described the decision to allow these price increases as great news for consumers. That's what she said—'great news for consumers'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">How much have they gone up in those eight months? They have gone up 10 per cent, 11 per cent, 12 per cent, 13 per cent and as much as 14 per cent in just eight months. And do you know who is hit hardest by these price rises that the minister described as 'great news for consumers'? Do you know who that is? It is the people who can afford it the least. It is the people on the lowest speed, more affordable plans who are suffering the greatest price increases. If you are on the 25 meg plan or the 50 meg plan, which is no less than six million Australian families, you have faced a price increase of 10 to 14 per cent in just eight months. It is a shameful indictment on this government in the middle of the Albanese government's cost-of-living crisis.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  We on this side of the House know that it has been a rough period for Australians. They just want to be able to pay for the things that they need. They just want to be able to go to the grocery store, buy food for their family, pay the rent, pay the mortgage and get on with things. It has been difficult, and we recognise that. That is why there has been a suite of policies that we have brought in to take the pressure off and to make sure that people can keep more of what they earn. These are things like a tax cut for every single Australian taxpayer, especially those who are lower- and middle-income earners. We know that the Morrison tax cuts were going to exclude many, many people in Australia, and we have changed them to ensure that every single taxpayer pays lower tax from 1 July, which was two days ago.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've given every single household and business at least $300 off their energy bills. We know that this is important because energy prices are causing pressure for families and for businesses, and that's why we have given them $300. We've also capped coal and gas prices. That's something that those opposite opposed here in this place on multiple occasions. We extended paid parental leave by two weeks. We made medicines cheaper by freezing the cost of the PBS, and we've also delivered a wage increase to 2.6 million Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Compare that with those opposite, who made low wages a deliberate design feature of their economic management, increased HECS, didn't deliver a single surplus, didn't build social and affordable homes, and cut funding from TAFE. We on this side are going to ease cost-of-living pressures, while those opposite will just remain in opposition.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  Today I will speak about transport infrastructure on the southern Gold Coast, specifically about the upgrades to the M1. There is quite a long history to this particular upgrade. Back in the lead-up to the 2007 election, there was a commitment made by the coalition government to upgrade the M1 from the south of Brisbane through to Tugun on the Gold Coast, with the priority area to be the upgrade from Tugun to Nerang. The Labor opposition at the time also matched that commitment so, even though there was a change of government, the funding still came through and the upgrades went ahead. Unfortunately, the upgrade didn't start at Tugun; it actually started south of Brisbane and came south. This meant, unfortunately, that by the time the upgrade had got as far south as Mudgeeraba, the money had run out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the federal member for McPherson, I went back and secured additional funding—firstly, to upgrade the M1 from Mudgeeraba through to Varsity Lakes. Then I had to go back a second time to get further funding so that we could complete the upgrade from Varsity Lakes through to Tugun. That work is currently underway. It has been a mammoth exercise that started in 2007—and here we are in 2024 without that upgrade completed. The people of the southern Gold Coast have waited long enough for this upgrade to be completed. It must be prioritised by the state government. We must make sure that we do everything we can to ease congestion and get the upgrade finished.</span>

In practice, the NDIS both supports and aims to make a real and meaningful difference to the lives of well over half a million Australians and their families. This includes the 9,768 participants in my electorate of Spence, the highest number across the country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Spence has a lot at stake when it comes to ensuring that the NDIS gets back on track, which is why I am saddened to see the Liberal Party and the Greens team up again, playing games in the Senate and holding up the passage of our government's NDIS reforms. They grandstand in the media as if they are sworn enemies; however, they can be spotted sitting next to one another a little too often for that to be true. Their decision to delay this bill so that a committee that has spent over three months reviewing the bill and tabled its report last month can conduct yet another inquiry is a decision which will cost Australians $1 million each hour, every hour, until the second report is due, in early August. That's around $1.1 billion, all up. Worse still, these Canberra bubble shenanigans leave scores of vulnerable participants at risk of exploitation at the hands of dodgy for-profit providers that fail to grasp what the NDIS is actually about: enriching the lives of participants and not themselves. As for the Liberals and Greens, with enemies like each other, who would even need friends?</span>

Last year, Holly was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a cancer which affects the nervous system, which had already spread to her spine and lymph nodes. She's currently undergoing traditional treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a new drug available in the US called DFMO, and the family is contemplating the half a million dollars it would take to go to the US to seek this treatment, including having to relocate one of the family members there for that period of time. It is every parent's worst nightmare, of course. As her mother said, 'You would try anything you could to stop a relapse; you'd regret not trying.' So they're doing everything they possibly can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, DFMO is not available in Australia. It's currently with the TGA for approval, and the next step would be to get it onto the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I know that ministers are at arm's length from the TGA, but I'm just asking Mark Butler and the team in his department to lean on the TGA to get this approval done as quickly as possible so that Holly Zerk and her parents don't have to relocate to the US—or the other 39 children a year who are diagnosed with this condition in Australia.</span>

Under the coalition's tax plan, they would have got next to nothing in cost-of-living relief. Let that sink in. Workers on the minimum wage would have got almost nothing to help with the cost of living under the tax plan devised by those opposite. Contrast that with the Labor government's plan. We are providing a tax cut for all Australian taxpayers. We also advocated for three minimum-wage rises with the Fair Work Commission.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Put yourself in the shoes of that cleaner working full time on the minimum wage, earning about $45,000 a year. Because of the Albanese Labor government's advocacy, their wage has now gone up by $143 a week. That is more than $7,000 a year in pay rises in just over two years for that worker. And, as of 1 July, they will get an $800-a-year tax cut. Under those opposite, that cleaner would have got nothing. We on this side of the House know that aspiration doesn't start at $80,000 or $100,000 a year. While those opposite like to go on about helping people, we on this side of the House are actually getting on and doing it.</span>

My mission is to train with all 44 football and netball clubs in my electorate of Nicholls, and I'm well on the way. From the Tigers in Rochester to the Pigeons in Yarrawonga, the Lions in Seymour and the Swans in Avenel, football and netball clubs bring communities together. They put their arms around families when tragedy strikes, and they pitch in when disasters happen. They also tackle issues together, like the scourge of violence against women, mental health and suicide.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why am I training with these clubs? It's an opportunity to connect with and hear from hardworking regional Australians and talk about the industries that sustain them and the government policies that either support them or threaten them. I also want to draw attention to the need for all levels of government to assist with change room facilities that are appropriate for all abilities, ages and genders. Too often young women are changing in car parks or substandard facilities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Football and netball clubs are playing an amazing role in bringing families and communities together. We have an obligation to help make them places where people want to come and play. In recent weeks I've trained with Yarroweyah, Strathmerton and Katunga. If anyone in Australia wants to be inspired, they need look no further than these fine communities and their amazingly supportive football and netball clubs.</span>

I particularly wish to thank Captain Lesley Newton of the Umina Beach Corps for her and her team's great efforts over that weekend. Throughout the weekend, the Umina Beach Corps managed to raise a whopping $26,822.25, with an incredible $22,000 being from their four roadside locations. One person even donated $600. What made this year better than previous years was that all of their roadside locations included EFTPOS machines, and the people of the Central Coast responded well to this. Thank you to the Rotary Club of Umina Beach as well, who rolled up their sleeves and generously gave their time to the cause. I also want to thank Tammy Newton, who devoted the weekend to manning the counting house and ensuring that the count was completed accurately.</span>

Congratulations to the Salvation Army Umina Beach Corps on a monumental effort for such a worthy cause. The people of the Central Coast are so proud of the work that you do.</span>

Invictus Australia supports veterans and their families through the power of sport to assist in recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration into the community.</span>

She's now playing three times a week, and it has had a huge impact on her fitness, mobility and strength. I met Brad and his OPK9 dog Bunji, who put his paw up and shook my hand, and Brad talked about the therapeutic benefit of service dogs. He takes Bunji along to a number of support organisations, where Bunji engages with the other veterans. I met Emma from parkrun and heard about the partnership between Invictus and parkrun, and I was given an Invictus T-shirt, which I promise to wear to a future parkrun. And I watched a seated volleyball game, a remarkably fast and active game. A number of other support agencies were present, including Hayley from Defence Kidz, Kookaburra Kids, Soldier On, Open Doors and Legacy. </span>

Just one more interest rate rise will wipe out more than half of the 1 July tax cuts for the average homeowner, and we know that most economists now expect the next movement in interest rates to be up. </span>

But that's the very same promise they made when they were first elected over two years ago, and hardworking Australian families and small businesses know from bitter experience that this is a false claim because they know from what's happening in their own lives that, after two years of this incompetent Labor government, food is up 11.4 per cent, housing is up 14 per cent, rents are up 14.2 per cent and electricity is up 21.5 per cent. That's what happens when you have a big-spending Labor government with no economic plan. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  July is a very big month for national days of countries I feel strongly about: 1 July, Canada; tomorrow, 4 July, USA; and 14 July, France. But, this year, 1 July was a big day for Australians—not quite Christmas in July, but even the scrooges opposite that have been lining up to speak must be looking forward to going home and telling their constituents, over the next five weeks, about those tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer. From 1 July, 13.6 million Australians will get a tax cut. The average worker will be $1,500 better off. And for the nontaxpayers—there could be a few of them—every household will get that $300 energy bill relief. One million small businesses—I think you remember small businesses?—will get $325, and 2.6 million low-paid workers are getting their third consecutive pay rise.</span>

I know you don't have time for a lot of things, but take my speech and send it to your constituents. It covers all of the topics. It will save you a lot of time.</span>

Before the Prime Minister was elected, under the coalition government a typical Australian family could secure a new variable rate home loan at 2.4 per cent, paying $35,000 a year. After two years of the Albanese government's decisions driving up inflation, the new loan variable interest rate is 6.3 per cent, costing Australian families an extra $21,000 in after-tax dollars. Why won't the Prime Minister admit that his $315 billion spending spree is driving homegrown inflation and threatening further interest rate increases into the future?</span>

I'm happy to comment on that, because, in the March quarter of 2022, inflation went up by 2.1 per cent—the biggest quarterly rise this century—and what we've done is reduce inflation from where we inherited it. When it comes to wages, outside of the pandemic, the biggest drop in real wages this century also occurred in the March quarter of 2022. It went down 1.4 per cent. So, think about this: inflation, a record up in 2022 and wages, a record down in March 2022. Real wages grew more in the past year at 0.5 per cent than they did during their entire 10 years in office.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We inherited a sluggish labour market. Under us, 880,000 new jobs have been created. Productivity growth under them was the worst in 40 years, and we've reversed that decline. Business investment declined to the lowest level since the early 2000s under them. Business investment under us has grown in every single quarter and is up 13 per cent in real terms. Then, of course, there's the budget under them. They planned a $78 billion deficit with no surpluses projected at any time between 2022 and 2060-61. Those were their projections going forward. We turned that $78 billion deficit into a Labor surplus of $22 billion and then a second Labor surplus in the following year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also make this absurd claim about government spending, and they include in that things that I'd suggest, therefore, they must be opposed to such as indexation of the aged pension—they're against that—indexation of income support payments and the pay rise for aged-care workers. Well, they've been upfront about opposing that. There's funding for new medicines on the PBS—apparently, they're against all of that—and the natural disaster recovery funding and relief in the electorates of the member for Riverina, the member for Calare, the member for Page and the member for Richmond. In all of these electorates, they're against that as well, apparently.</span>

It's all about maximising our geological, geographical, geopolitical and meteorological advantages. It's all about broadening and deepening our industrial base and becoming a renewable energy superpower. It's all about making ourselves an indispensable part of the global net zero transformation—the biggest change in the global economy since the Industrial Revolution—and ensuring that our people and businesses are beneficiaries, not victims, of that change.</span>

It's a very important day because a future made in Australia is absolutely central to this Prime Minister's vision for the future of our economy. Our economic plan is all about relief, repair and reform: relief this week with substantial, meaningful and responsible cost-of-living help; repair of the budget which sees us turn two big Liberal deficits into Labor surpluses; and reform to modernise our economy and maximise our advantages.</span>

After three failed budgets, the Prime Minister has failed to tackle and beat inflation. Respected economist Chris Richardson has said, 'Governments have abandoned the field in the inflation fight. We are fighting the inflation fight one-handed,' and, 'Mortgage relief is a very, very long way away.' When will the Prime Minister admit his $315 billion spending spree is driving homegrown inflation and threatening further interest rate increases into the future?</span>

If he's angry about inflation which is running in quarterly terms at 3.6 per cent, he must have been absolutely furious with the 6.1 per cent he left us when he stopped being one of the most embarrassing parts of the worst-performing government since Federation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When inflation had a six in front of it and was on the way up, when interest rates were already rising, they delivered a budget which had a net policy spend of nearly $40 billion, which is nearly double what our budget did. They forecast two deficits, which we are turning into two Labor surpluses. In two years alone, a $165 billion turnaround in the budget. That is historic, a total of $215 billion. We've banked the vast majority of revenue upgrades. They used to spend most of it. We found almost $80 billion in savings in the budget. Their last budget had precisely zero dollars in savings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I'm making here, with this avalanche of damning facts about their record in office, is that they wouldn't know the first thing about responsible economic management. The shadow Treasurer wouldn't know responsible economic management if it slapped him in the face, and their record speaks for itself. As the Prime Minister rightly pointed out a moment ago, when we came to office there were deficits as far as the eye could see. There was $1 trillion in Liberal Party debt and almost nothing to show for it, and the budget was being consumed by the interest costs on that debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been working in a considered, methodical and responsible way to clean up the mess that we inherited from those opposite. We've seen inflation moderate substantially since they were in office, but not enough. It needs to moderate further and faster, and we know, from the comments from the Reserve Bank governor and Reserve Bank deputy governor, that the sorts of things that we are doing are helping in the fight against inflation—primarily, turning your two big Liberal deficits into two Labor surpluses. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has said that is helpful in the fight against inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last point that I would make—but I hope I get many more questions about this—is, if those opposite really cared about the cost-of-living pressures people are under, they wouldn't be opposing the cost-of-living relief which is rolling out this week.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Strong economies possess strong manufacturing capabilities, and our Future Made in Australia plans are about mobilising Australian manufacturing to make the things that reduce emissions and create strong, secure jobs in the process, delivering sovereign capability—allowing us to stand on our own two feet—reducing our dependency on concentrated supply chains and building economic resilience—jobs up, emissions down, stronger economy. That's what our Future Made in Australia legislation is all about. We've got this once-in-a-generation opportunity to leverage off our deep reserves of critical minerals and resources. We've got a constant supply of sun and wind that bless our continent, and an army of skilled Australian workers who can get the job done to take our economy forward. The Future Made in Australia legislation introduced today by the Treasurer is about locking in our advantages and investing in our strengths and, importantly, doing so without pushing up energy prices for manufacturers with risky, expensive nuclear reactors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You could fit their nuclear plans on a Post-it note, with space left over. They've got key details missing, like, how much will it actually cost? How much more will manufacturers and households pay for their power supply? It's an idea so staggeringly uninvestible they didn't even commit to work with the private sector to finance their power plants. Breathtakingly, we've got a Leader of the Opposition trying to dress this sham up as some sort of help for Australian manufacturing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, the Liberal and National parties only ever talk about manufacturing to talk it down. In government, they chased out our car manufacturers. They oversaw the destruction of 100,000 manufacturing jobs. In opposition, they wouldn't vote for the National Reconstruction Fund. They wouldn't back energy price relief for manufacturers and they wanted to call an early election to stop tax cuts for manufacturing workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, desperate to sell this dud of a policy, we hear in the distance the Deputy Leader of the Opposition say, 'Just tell them it's good for manufacturing'. The political nous just blows my mind. They're only talking about manufacturing now, friends, because it's in their political interests—not because it's the national interest; it's in their political interest, and they chase away manufacturers. Australian manufacturing workers deserve better, and our Future Made in Australia plan will deliver better. </span>

Despite all the federal government's talk about doubling housing and homelessness funding, funding for Tasmania will, in fact, decline this year under the National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness from $38.1 million to $37.4 million. This is the biggest proportional decline of any state. Minister, I'm sure you understand the dire housing situation in Tasmania as well as I do. How on earth could you let this happen? </span>

Indeed, I share his concern, in terms of what is happening in Tasmania with housing. But I want to reassure the member for Clark that the inference of his question is actually not true. No state or territory is going backwards in funding under the new agreement. None.

Since our election, since we came to office, we've provided more than $145 million to Tasmania for homelessness services and to build more homes. Under Housing Australia, with the Housing Accord and the Housing Australia Future Fund, Tasmania, as one of the smaller jurisdictions, will be getting at least 1,200 homes on top of that funding. So Tasmania will be getting our fair share, let me assure you of that, as will other states and territories. </span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the member for Clark. I will reiterate: no state or territory will be receiving any less under the new housing agreement. Let me be very clear about that. I'm happy to have a meeting with the member for Clark to go through the figures and clear this up with him. I'm also happy to advise the member for Clark that 25,000 Tasmanians will be benefiting from an increase in Commonwealth rent assistance—the first back-to-back increase in more than 30 years. That will be supporting many Tasmanians. Since the last election, the Albanese Labor government has also supported 1,500 Tasmanians into homeownership through our expanded and improved Home Guarantee Scheme and, of course, we want to do more with Help to Buy, the shared equity scheme. I'll continue to work with the Tasmanian government to deliver more homes for Tasmanians who need them. </span>

The member for Swan, as an engineer, born and raised in Kalgoorlie, knows Australia's opportunity to be a renewable energy superpower. She dedicated her professional life to solutions to decarbonise Australia and the world, and she's continuing that in this House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's an energy transformation underway right around the world, and Australian energy can power it; Australian regions can drive it; Australian resources can build it; Australian entrepreneurs and researchers can design it; and Australian workers can thrive from it—but only with the right policy settings. And the right policy settings are the ones that the Treasurer and I introduced into the parliament today. They have been worked on by the Minister for Industry and Science, the Minister for Resources and the entire cabinet to seize the opportunities for our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These opportunities are enormous. Our investment in green hydrogen, for example, is designed to unlock $50 billion worth of private sector investment by unleashing and unlocking that private sector investment, and to create jobs. The legislation we introduced today outlines the rigorous process and the national interest test, and it also provides statutorily protected funding for ARENA—ARENA, which the previous government tried to abolish and tried to defund on so many occasions. We're locking in that funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member asked me what policies we rejected instead of the policies that we are implementing. Now, of course, those opposite propose a policy which promises jobs decades away—which is a unicorn. I'll take some examples, because what our policy is designed to do is to stop Australian ingenuity and Australian expertise being exported to jobs offshore. Australia invented the modern solar panel and we invented the flow battery. Australians have invented the most efficient solar panel in the world, through SunDrive. They had to decide whether to manufacture in Australia or in the United States. After the release of our policies Solar Sunshot and Future Made in Australia, they have decided to manufacture in Australia. Do you know where, Mr Speaker? On the site of the old Liddell Power Station. They will employ more Australians there than the power station ever did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But those plans are threatened because somebody else wants to build a nuclear power station there some years into the future. So the people of the Hunter have a choice: real jobs now making Australian solar panels, or fake fantasy jobs decades into the future making nuclear energy. Both can't be true. Either we make solar panels at Liddell now or the opposition gets its way and the site is quarantined for a nuclear plant decades in the future. That's why this Leader of the Opposition presents a real risk to the Australian economy, and a real risk to Australian jobs.</span>

But they've also opposed, along with the Greens, just during this sitting fortnight, the build-to-rent tax incentives. And their justification for opposing this is that developers build housing. That's the justification. So they're against public housing, and they're against private rentals. But, in opposing the Help to Buy scheme, they're also against homeownership.</span>

He'll just need to make sure his comments are directly relevant to the question. He can't stray into other areas of policy topics, because it was specifically around housing.

So I'm not sure what form of housing they want, because they don't want public housing, they don't want private rentals, and they don't want homeownership. All three have they opposed.</span>

I note that 95,000 of her constituents got a tax cut this week as well as, of course, many tens of thousands who got a wage increase. Every single household got $300 in energy bill relief, and I visited a chemist in the electorate of Lalor just a couple of weeks ago with the member. There, of course, the pharmacists as well as constituents were talking about the real benefit that our cheaper medicines policy has had.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we're dealing with the immediate, but we're also setting Australia up for the future. That's what the Future Made in Australia Act is all about—the next step in building a more prosperous future for every Australian, making more things here in Australia, making our economy more resilient, creating secure, well-paid jobs for Australians and making sure that workers and communities benefit from those jobs. And that is what our Future Made in Australia Act that was introduced today is all about—engaging and investing, not retreating and protecting, attracting private investment, not replacing it, and aligning our national security and our economic security interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national interest framework that is at the heart of this legislation also speaks about identifying sectors where we have a comparative advantage in the world economy. In areas like green hydrogen, we have a comparative advantage going forward. And indeed as well, as the world moves to a net zero economy, there is nowhere you'd rather be than Australia. But it'll also examine the national interest on the basis of economic resilience but also our national security. Public investment will be an important part of the plan, but the most important role for public investment will be to unlock private sector investment, because we on this side of the House haven't abandoned the private sector. We on this side of the House understand the importance of backing business. Our public investment will show us a path to a future made in Australia, but private capital is essential. And that's why our Future Made in Australia agenda is an investment strategy and it is a growth strategy, to provide investors with the clarity and certainty that they need going forward so they can invest in Australia's future and take the Australian population with them to deliver good, secure, well-paid jobs.</span>

He speaks about migration during the period in which we have been in office. I suggest he should join those who stand up in the coalition party room and question the leadership of this bloke because the Leader of the Opposition had this to say in 2022: 'We do need an increase in the migration numbers. It is clear the number needs to be higher.' He went on to say later in the year, just in case you think that was a one-off: 'In addition to a domestic workforce, of course, we need migration.' In his first budget reply the Leader of the Opposition boasted, 'I brought in record numbers of people.' That is what he had to say in his first budget reply.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have done is cut the numbers in half. That is just a fact. We know that Dr Martin Parkinson, who served under those opposite as the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, had this to say after his review: 'This is a 10-year rebuild. This is not something you do quickly because it is so badly broken. It was a deliberate decision to neglect the system.' Christine Nixon, who did an examination as well, said, 'I was surprised at the breadth, the various areas where visas were used to exploit people or for people to exploit the system.' Of course, Dennis Richardson said lack of proper due diligence resulted in public money being handed to individuals and businesses suspected of seeking to circumvent US sanctions against Iran—money laundering, bribery, drugs and arms smuggling into Australia, and corruption.</span>

If you ask a question regarding immigration numbers and the impact that has on the housing crisis, which was the way the question was framed, with respect to the member, regarding direct relevance, if the Prime Minister is reading quotes not about immigration or not reading about the impacts, that would not be relevant. I am listening carefully. He is reading. He is contesting the figures that were in the question, which he is entitled to do under the standing orders. He just has to make sure his quotes and his references are regarding the topic, particularly on the numbers he was asked about. At this point he is doing that, so he is being directly relevant. He has one minute to go for the remainder of his answer and he has the call.</span>

                  </a>  What we have done is we have restored the immigration compliance function that was cut by the Leader of the Opposition by nearly 50 per cent. We have increased the temporary skilled migration income threshold up to $70,000. We have ended the pandemic event visa, something those opposite left in place. We have cracked down on rorts in international education. We've implemented a $160 million reform package. We've imposed no-further-stay conditions on visitor visas. We're ending migration system settings that drove temporary visa holders to stay long term and we're introducing limits on international student numbers. We're taking action—as opposed to the mess that we inherited from those opposite.</span>

In the last week alone, we have rolled out cost-of-living help for every taxpayer and every household, we have introduced the Future Made in Australia legislation—earlier today—and we got confirmation on Friday that we are on track for a second surplus, the first time there have been back-to-back surpluses in our budgets for almost two decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the fruits of responsible economic policy made in a considered, methodical and consultative way. It's all about understanding the challenges and chances in our economy and managing them and modernising our economy and maximising our advantages so that our people benefit. That's because we understand that you ease cost-of-living pressures with tax cuts and energy bill relief, not with expensive nuclear reactors which will push up energy prices. We understand that the best way to invest in the future is with clarity and ambition, not with the kind of extreme ideology that creates investor uncertainty, which is what we hear from those opposite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the shambolic announcement that we heard yesterday makes the contrast between this side of the House and that side of the House even clearer. Their announcement on divestiture has exactly the same shambolic features as the nuclear announcement, the tax announcement and the migration announcement. Every announcement that they make is a new bin fire of angry incompetence which puts the future of our economy at risk. Every new announcement that they make is the worst combination of uncosted, unhinged and undercooked. The primary purpose of each new announcement seems to be to distract from the announcement that they made a few weeks ago. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you a sense of that, Mr Speaker. Even a cursory look at the headlines gives you a sense of the shambles of those opposite: shadow Treasurer 'rules out subsidies for nuclear power' before they announce 100 per cent subsidies; shadow Treasurer 'further confuses coalition's migration message'; 'Shadow treasurer changes script on Dutton's immigration cuts'; shadow Treasurer 'at odds' with leader 'on migration targets in "shambolic" post-budget appearance'; Leader of the Opposition 'vetoes Nats-Greens supermarket break-up plan' just before he announces it; 'Liberals split on big retailers break-up'; Leader of the Opposition's 'supermarket push leaves some colleagues feeling "ambushed"'; 'Peter Dutton says tax cut plan "too costly"'—that's the tax cut plan that the shadow Treasurer has announced. But my favourite of all of them is this headline: '"He is not incompetent": Dutton backs Taylor'. It's responsible economic management versus the shambles of those opposite.</span>

We have partnered with CHOICE to give households better information about prices. We banned unfair contract terms and directed the ACCC to conduct an inquiry. All of these actions are designed to bring prices down.</span>

Two days after the big announcement, we're yet to get a question from those opposite, so we've got to organise our own questions about their policies! But I am glad that we were obliged by the member for Hasluck. This isn't so much a policy as an unexpected item in the baggage area! That's what this is. As an independent review states—</span>

We're about halfway through the answer. The Prime Minister is obviously outlining what the government is rejecting, but he can't have his whole answer about that, and he hasn't done that so far, so he's being directly relevant.

They want publicly owned energy through nuclear energy, and now they want, one would assume, publicly owned supermarkets. Because if Coles has to sell, guess who will buy it? Maybe Woolworths—just maybe! Nuclear reactors that drive up power prices and a supermarket shemozzle that will drive up grocery prices. These are the big ideas that they have, those opposite, but Australians will be left with the bill.</span>

Your Labor government has over 1,300 autonomous sanctions on Russia because of their violation of international law yet, even with the UN confirming the Israeli government has committed war crimes in Palestine, you failed to impose any sanctions at all. Will you impose any sanctions on the government of Israel? Why have you put more sanctions on a senator for speaking out about Palestine than on the extremist Netanyahu government for invading Palestine?</span>

The cross-section there is full of people who used to be members of the National Party or members of the Liberal Party. Senator Thorpe, of course, was elected earlier, in the last election, as a member of the Greens political party and chose to depart from that. From time to time, that happens. And that has happened, in terms of the senator making a decision, that she wished to be able to take an independent position when it comes to the Middle East.</span>

                  </a>  I'm also asked about events in the Middle East and our position. Our opposition has been very consistent. Our position has been consistent with the motion that was moved by Senator Wong in the Senate—one which people need to explain why it is that they objected to such a motion. It was about the need for the Senate to recognise the state of Palestine as part of a peace process in support of a two-state solution and a just and enduring peace. That's the view of those of us on this side of the House, that those in the Greens political party in the Senate and the coalition voted against. I don't understand what's objectionable about it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key to what needs to happen in the Middle East is that there needs to be support for President Biden's peace plan. There needs to be a ceasefire and an end to what has occurred in Gaza. There needs to be, therefore, a release of hostages. There needs to be increased humanitarian support for the people of Gaza, and there needs to be a lasting and enduring peace. That means the people of Palestine and Israel living side by side in peace and security. That is our position. That is something that we work towards.</span>

As the member for Reid knows, providing a welcoming and stable policy environment for investment, particularly in renewable energy, has been the centrepiece of our policy since we came to office. From the passage of the Climate Change Act, legislating our targets to provide that certainty, through to the Capacity Investment Scheme and the Future Made in Australia Bill that we introduced today, it is all about attracting investment, creating jobs and reducing prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we've been able to see an increase in renewable energy in our grid of 25 per cent. It's why the Minister for the Environment and Water has been able to approve more renewable applications than the Abbott and Turnbull governments combined—enough to power two million homes. That's why we've seen 8.5 gigawatts of new renewable energy in our system, and it's why the Capacity Investment Scheme auction, which closed last week, for six gigawatts had a massive 40 gigawatts worth of bids for it. It shows the pipeline of projects that are ready to go with the right policy environment, reducing prices and creating jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member asked me what policies we reject. We reject policies to rip up contracts and break up companies. The alternative economic policy of this country is to rip up existing contracts and break up companies. The leader of the National Party said he was going to cancel all the offshore wind zones. When asked, 'Are you going to cancel Gippsland?' he said, 'No, because that's smaller than the Illawarra zone.' It's 15 times bigger, actually, but that's the level of analysis we get from the leader of the National Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The one thing that combines these two policies—to rip up contracts for renewable energy and break up companies—is that they were designed by the National Party. I want to give credit where it's due. The current leader of the National Party's ideas are just as dangerous as those of the member for New England. He's just much more effective at getting them implemented than the member for New England was. He's actually writing the policies of the alternative government. The once great Liberal Party of Australia has vacated the field for the National Party. When you hear that the National Party is writing economic policy you should be very worried. The only thing that should worry you more is when that policy is being written by a coalition of the Greens and the National Party together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting the National Party in charge of economic policy is like putting the member for Hume in charge of a Facebook page—there are lots of things that can go wrong. We've seen the shadow Treasurer rolled more often than a pair of dice at a games party. He's completely abrogated the field of good economic policy. What the leader of the National Party is doing, to his credit—I always like to give credit where it's due. As a post-partisan figure at the dispatch box, I like to give credit where it's due. The Leader of the National Party smells weakness on the Leader of the Opposition. He smells policy weakness. He sees a vacuum and he wants to fill it. That means a big risk for Australian business, it means a big risk for Australian investment and it means a big risk for Australian jobs from the Littleproud-Dutton government.</span>

The coalition is standing up for small businesses, farmers and consumers by ensuring stronger penalties for anticompetitive behaviour in our supermarket sector, including divestiture powers for the worst misconduct. These actions are in line with comments made earlier this year by the chair of the ACCC, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, who said that divestiture powers would be 'useful to have in the toolkit'. When will the Prime Minister show leadership and join the coalition in supporting a fairer deal for families and farmers at the check-out?</span>

There are 70,000 of the member for Groom's constituents who will benefit as a result of the tax cut on Monday. I hope that the member for Groom has told them that they oppose it, and I hope as well that he goes out there and spruiks this divestiture policy that was not so much announced but slipped out by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. He did a stand-up before question time, then came in here and didn't ask a single question about it, and nor has he today. But the member for Groom will never say no to an opportunity. The fact is that this is a model that will lead to higher prices. I'm not sure who they think will buy a Woolworths or a Coles if they're forced to sell in a local community—except each other. That is why it is such an impractical plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said before that it has been quite a journey for the Liberal Party of Menzies, to go from trying to ban the Communist Party to trying to implement state ownership of both supermarkets and our energy sector. You can imagine how they'll go during the election campaign. 'Seize the means of production,' they'll be out there saying. 'Seize the means of electricity production.' When it comes to energy and nuclear reactors, 'Socialism in our half-lifetime' will be the slogan that they have. At the next election, it won't so much be a three-year plan; it'll be a five-year plan—because the National Party have completely taken over the agenda over there, as the minister for energy has said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no credible argument for this policy. It began as an economic policy from the Greens political party. Those opposite were in government for a decade and never did it. They wouldn't even mandate the voluntary code of conduct. So they've gone, in just two years, from having a voluntary code written by the supermarkets themselves to, potentially, nationalising those supermarkets—and, in between times, the seamless segue that occurred prior to Australia Day of the Leader of the Opposition wanting Woolies boycotted over what thongs they sold.</span>

That's why I'm incredibly proud to be part of a Labor government that takes real action to improve the lives of regional people. This week, every taxpayer in our regions got a tax cut, and millions of Australians also got a pay rise.

This fund will be an absolute game changer—the biggest manufacturing package ever seen in Australia's history. We're not prepared to tell car manufacturers to go offshore. We're going to make sure manufacturers set up onshore. We want to make sure that there's an unprecedented level of funding bringing skilled jobs into our regions to boost local economies.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're talking to regional communities about the benefits of an energy evolution and the manufacturing jobs that come from it, those opposite are talking to themselves. We are supporting people to stay local and to train local, because we don't want people to have to pack their bags to get an opportunity in a big city. We want them to build a career in regional Australia. We are making our economy more resilient, creating jobs and a better future for regional and rural Australia. That's how you deliver growth for regional communities. We don't want another decade to tick by. Under those opposite, it was delays and excuses. Under us, it's action. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Not-for-profits with an ABN are required to lodge annual self-review returns to the ATO. Many organisations are run by retired volunteers who tell me it's an overwhelming process involving a myGov ID, an online lodgement system or waiting to be answered on the ATO line. Why won't the minister make it easier for such organisations by allowing them to lodge a paper form?</span>

This is true in relation to individual taxpayers and it's also true in relation to not-for-profit and other organisations as well. To the specific issues that you raise, member for Mayo, I would be happy to engage with you and other members of this House to ensure we can help not-for-profit organisations and small businesses meet these obligations.</span>

It was great to be with her at Tonsley TAFE meeting with fee-free TAFE students pretty recently. Of all the things that we've learned through enduring a global pandemic, perhaps the most important was the need to be more self-reliant as a nation, to stand on our own two feet, and to build greater sovereign capability. The Albanese government understands that supporting a Future Made in Australia is essential to achieving that goal to rebuild our manufacturing sector. Those opposite have historically failed to support the manufacturing sector.</span>

                  </a>  That was a very interesting interjection because who could forget the former Liberal-National government goading a car company to leave our shores? That's exactly what happened because of the efforts of the previous Liberal government. Of course, they've never supported the car industry and they actually said that governments shouldn't support the industry, which makes it rather bizarre that they want to tip hundreds of billions of dollars into a risky, expensive, state-owned nuclear reactor situation. Effectively, the opposition is saying that 'We couldn't support the car industry, but we can actually invest hundreds of billions of taxpayers' dollars into nuclear reactors.' Well, what a remarkable turnaround by those opposite. The fact is, we need to invest in areas of demand and we need to invest in the manufacturing sector. That's why we introduced fee-free TAFE. We've now had more than 400,000 Australians enrol in fee-free TAFE in areas such as the energy sector, the manufacturing sector, the IT sector and more.

To ensure that we're delivering the best possible skills, we are creating centres of excellence, bringing universities and TAFEs together and working with industry. We recently announced one in Western Australia, another in Canberra and there are many more to come.</span>

He was asked a specific question, not 'whether he would rule in or out'. The question was, 'Does the Prime Minister guarantee that during his prime ministership he will not change the current negative gearing and capital gains tax treatment of rental properties?' That was the question put. The preprepared list that he's got for ruling things out is not relevant to this question, and I ask you to direct him to answer the question, as you did earlier.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWK" type="MemberAnswer">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  I thank the terrific member for Aston for that question, because she knows and is proud of the fact that Australia has one of the best medicine systems in the world, underpinned by the PBS, which is a great Labor legacy that was opposed tooth and nail, just like Medicare, by the Liberal Party when we went to introduce it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The PBS ensures that Australian patients get access to the best cutting-edge treatments that are developed anywhere in the world at affordable prices. In just two years in government, we've already made more than 200 new or expanded listings on the PBS. This week, for example, we listed a brand-new treatment for an extreme form of lupus, an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and sometimes very serious organ damage. Lupus affects around 20,000 people in Australia, 90 per cent of whom are women, and the new treatment, Saphnelo, is the first new treatment for this extreme form of lupus in literally decades. I'm advised it will benefit around 1,400 patients each and every year. And, without the listing, they'd be paying around $19,000 a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know that, even at PBS prices, too many Australians still have difficulty affording the medicines that their doctors have prescribed for them—around a million every year, according to the ABS. That is why we promised the Australian people that we would make medicines cheaper, and we've spent the last two years being busy delivering on that promise. In just the first three months of government, we slashed the maximum amount that millions of pensioners would pay for their medicines each year by 25 per cent. In the first 12 months, we delivered the biggest cut to the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the PBS, and, in the first 18 months, we finally allowed doctors to prescribe common medicines for chronic conditions for 60-day supply, not just 30-day supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the May budget, just a few weeks ago, we added another measure, which was to freeze the price of PBS medicines for up to five years. That measure alone will save Australian patients as much as half a billion dollars on top of the more than $400 million we have already saved them in just under two years. Cheaper medicines are obviously good for the hip pocket, but they're also good for people's health. It's just good health policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Leader of the Opposition had a very different approach, which I was asked about. In his first budget as health minister, a horror health budget, he actually tried to make medicines more expensive. He tried to jack up the price of medicines by up to $5 a script. And that is what you get from this guy: you get higher doctors' fees, you get higher medicine prices and you get higher grocery prices through his shambles of a supermarket policy. And of course you'd get higher power prices through nuclear reactors.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TAYLOR:</span>
                  </a>  I understand, Mr Speaker. The Treasurer loves a good bit of branding for his slogans, and I was just trying to help—nothing more than that! But, after two years and three failed budgets, inflation is raging in this country. Inflation is raging in this country, and we have seen four months in a row where it hasn't gone down but has gone up. We are the only one of the 10 major developed economies in the world where inflation has risen since December. This Treasurer has absolutely failed in the job he has, which is to deliver genuine underlying, sustainable cost-of-living relief for Australians. That's because, after three attempts, he has failed, not once, not twice, but three times, to deliver a budget that can actually solve the underlying problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're about to go off on a five-week winter break—it's about 5½ weeks of winter break. This is an opportunity for this Treasurer and this government to have another go. They've had three goes and failed three times in a row, but here's a chance for them to go away and have a think about how you actually beat inflation, not drive it up, as we have seen from this government and this Treasurer three times in a row. Traditionally, when the Treasurer has taken breaks, he has gone away and done things like write 6,000-word essays on remaking capitalism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, he's remaking capitalism right now; let me tell you! He is remaking capitalism right now, because inflation is going up in this country and it's going down in every other major advanced country in the world. During that time period we're also going to see the Reserve Bank meet again, and they'll be making an incredibly important decision. They will be deciding whether or not to raise rates—there's no sign that they're going to go down. They will also be deciding whether we're going to have higher rates for longer. And the one thing we can be confident of is that, under this Treasurer, under this government, we're going to have higher rates for longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the last budget we said there were three tests for the budget. That means there are three tests for the winter break, because they didn't pass any of those tests with their failed budget. The first is to restore Australians' standard of living back to where it was before they came to government. I'm sorry to say that, since Labor has been in power, we have seen an eight per cent reduction in the standard of living of Australians and we've seen a nine per cent cut in real wages—a nine per cent cut! I see the member for Parramatta has gone—oh, he's back again! He didn't understand that you measure real wages against the employee living costs index, which means they've gone down by nine per cent.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second test for the budget was to restore our way of life, because under those opposite we are seeing fewer young Australians holding out hope that they can own a home. The third test was to restore the budget discipline and transparency that was in place before they came into power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a sneak preview in the newspapers over the last 24 hours about how the Prime Minister intends to spend his break. Phil Coorey, of the <span style="font-style:italic;">AFR</span>, said that the Prime Minister 'has taken over the reins of policy development'. The Prime Minister's new edict:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… requires ministers to run all new proposals directly through the prime minister's office for approval …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to get more gas into the network, the minister at the table, the Minister for Resources, is going to have to have a chat to the Prime Minister, who we know doesn't love gas. We know he doesn't like it. It is also clear from this that the Treasurer has lost control of his role, which is to get inflation down. He's failed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that during the break there's more homework being done by the Prime Minister. He's going to do a reshuffle. It is time to move out some of these ministers who have absolutely failed. We have seen immigration rise at a rate which is completely unsustainable for the housing supply in this country. We've seen population growth of over 1.2 million in two years, the vast majority of which is immigration. And housing supply in that time has been going down, not up—closer to a quarter of a million. That simply doesn't work out. When you have four or five or six or seven houses, as the member for Parramatta does, how do those numbers work?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a reshuffle coming up, and I think it's time to give the member for Parramatta a go—what do you think? We'll give him a go. We think he needs a bit of a go. He's been auditioning regularly. I'm sure he's going to give a riveting speech in a moment. But it is time to give him a go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an alternative for how the Prime Minister and the Treasurer could spend this winter break, and that is to restore Australians' standard of living. As I said earlier, living standards have collapsed by eight per cent in the last two years under Labor. How can you achieve that in two years? Only a Treasurer who is completely inept, who wrote a thesis that was a love letter to Paul Keating, could possibly deliver that kind of outcome. At the same time, Labor promised to get real wages moving. They're moving alright; they went down nine per cent! They also promised to address the cost of living. They're certainly adding to the cost of living: on average, prices have gone up 10 per cent; substantially more for gas, for electricity, for insurance, for rentals—you name it. We have seen Australians suffering under serious pressure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear economists giving their views on what's been going on and what needs to be done during the winter break. Chris Richardson, a highly respected economist, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Governments have abandoned the field in the inflation fight. We are fighting the inflation fight one-handed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that's generous. He goes on to say, 'Mortgage relief is a very, very long way away.' Deutsche Bank economist Phil O'Donoghue says, 'Underlying inflation is intolerably high in Australia.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A moment ago we got another sneak preview as to how the Prime Minister is going to spend this winter break. We know that he has always wanted to impose a tax on the family home. We know he has always wanted to get rid of negative gearing. In fact, it was the minister for energy who, many years ago, belled the cat on this and said, 'If you don't like it, don't vote for it.' It was on these exact policies. Their vision for housing is not a vision where Australians own their homes. Their vision for housing is one where homes are owned by industry super funds and built by the CFMEU and where there are apartments for everybody. The standalone home is coming to an end; they're not being built anymore under this government. It's a dystopian vision that those opposite have always wanted for housing in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what we believe in. We believe in Australians having the opportunity to own their homes and of having the opportunity to own a home which is not necessarily an apartment. Some will want to, but many will want to own a standalone home—one that they buy by taking on a mortgage that they can repay over time. That means you have to get inflation down and you have to get interest rates down. The real job for those opposite over this break is to achieve exactly that outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't achieve that by adding $315 billion of spending. But, over this break, if we believe Phillip Coorey's article from the last 24 hours—and he tends to get it right—what we will actually see is the Prime Minister taking a big pot of money that's been hidden in the budget and spending it and, in the process, adding fuel to the inflationary fire. We can hope this winter break is used for a better outcome for Australians, but the truth is that that has not been achieved by this government in the past and there is little hope that it will be achieved in the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last Friday, I joined the opening of Toukley Neighbourhood Centre at its new location in Summerside Street. I recognise the work they're doing alongside Orange Sky, OzHarvest, We Care Connect and others to support locals. We have a responsibility as a government to respond in these times. Our government has a clear plan for relief of cost-of-living pressure, in ways that don't add to inflation and repair our budget and supply chains, and reform which lays the foundations for future growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From Monday of this week we are rolling out cost-of-living relief in the most responsible way to thousands of Australians. This includes a tax cut for every Australian, including 69,000 people in my electorate of Dobell, on the New South Wales Central Coast. There will be new energy bill relief to every household and one million small businesses—tackling inflation through responsible economic management—and a second budget surplus in two years, not as an end in itself but to provide cost-of-living relief for Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there's more to do, but why would you vote against these measures? Why would you get in the way of responsible cost-of-living relief for millions of Australians? Our policies in this year's budget will take three-quarters of a percentage point off inflation this year and half a percentage point next year, which Treasury are forecasting could now get back to the inflation target sooner. The ABS has also confirmed that inflation would be even higher if it weren't for our cost-of-living policies.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now want to turn to my areas of responsibility in health. We're working to improve access to care while reducing the cost to households. As the health minister said today, what is good for your health is also good for your hip pocket. There are significant investments rolling out to ease the cost of health care and make it easier for Australians wherever they live to get the care that they need. At the same time, we are making permanent structural changes to the health system so that Australians can have confidence that this system will be there for them and their families in the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in sharp contrast to what we inherited from those opposite. After a decade of neglect, bulk-billing was in freefall. It was never harder or more expensive to visit a GP. But our record investment in tripling the bulk-billing incentive has begun to turn it around in just a few short months. Since we tripled the investment, which started to come into effect last November, we have seen strong data on bulk-billing—a national increase of 3.4 per cent. Across the country, there has been an increase of 3.4 per cent in bulk-billing, growing from 75.6 per cent of all GP visits bulk-billed last October to 79 per cent in May this year. That is a significant and steady growth in bulk-billing. This means around two million additional estimated free visits to see the doctor. I know what that means as a pharmacist, as a local MP and as assistant health minister: a really big change in access and affordability of care, increasing access to health while reducing the cost to households.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This investment has also strengthened general practice and made general practice much more viable for the future, particularly in rural and regional communities, whose outlook was bleak under those opposite. We should never have Australians delaying or avoiding visiting their doctor or filling a prescription because they simply can't afford to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The same applies to the cost of medicines. I've been a pharmacist now for more than 25 years. I've worked in community pharmacy; I've worked in regional hospitals. I remember working in an after-hours pharmacy on the main road of Wyong, just opposite the train station. We'd have many people come in late at night. I remember a mother coming in to speak to me. I think she had four children, and three of them had asthma. She came in with their asthma treatment plans and a bundle of prescriptions and asked me which medicines she could avoid or delay filling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also remember another occasion of a mother coming to me. She had a shopping trolley full of groceries for her family. She'd been in to see the GP and then come across to the pharmacy. Both of her two children were unwell at the time, and she had prescriptions for antibiotic mixtures for both of them. She said, 'Can I just get one filled and share it between the two and see if after a couple of days they're doing better and I don't need to get the other prescription filled?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No person should be in a situation where they're forced to make that decision about their children's health and wellbeing. No parent should be forced to decide to fill or not fill a prescription for one of their children. This is what I saw when I was working in pharmacy under the former coalition government. We can't accept that in communities like mine. We can't accept that across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most recent budget froze the price of PBS medicines. This is really significant. We know that most PBS medicines filled are filled by people who are on healthcare cards, but what this will do is freeze the price of PBS medicines at $31.60 for general patients until the end of 2025 and at $7.70 for concession patients until the end of 2029—for five years. This is significant cost-of-living relief. This will make such a difference to so many people and families coming into community pharmacies right around the country. They will know with confidence that they can afford to pay for their medicine and get the care that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This builds on the government's other measures for cheaper medicines since being elected in May 2022. In July 2022, we lowered the PBS safety net threshold. In October 2022, we reduced the price of 2,000 medicines. In January 2023, we delivered the largest price reduction in the history of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In September 2023, we introduced 60-day prescriptions for 100 medicines. In March 2024, we expanded 60-day prescriptions to a total of 184 medicines. The third tranche will come into effect in September this year and take the total to some 300 medicines. As a pharmacist, I know what a significant difference this is already making. Around five million Australians have saved more than $414 million on cheaper prescriptions since January 2023. This is good for people's health and it's good, as the health minister says, for their hip pocket.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to bulk-billed GP appointments, Australians are also benefiting from quality free health care at a national network of Medicare Urgent Care Clinics. I visited many of the 58 open around the country—and now that number is on its way up to 87. There have been over 494,000 visits to Medicare Urgent Care Clinics around Australia for free, quality, timely care. Medicare Urgent Care Clinics are supporting children and families with over one in four visits from someone aged under 15, making it a trusted place for families to go as an alternative to an emergency department. Over one in three visits have been outside of regular working hours. Half of all patients who presented to Medicare Urgent Care Clinics say they would have otherwise gone to a hospital emergency department. So we're also helping to ease the pressure on those stretched emergency departments of our state hospitals. These are everyday Australians putting their trust in Medicare and using services which make their lives just that little bit easier. Once again, we're easing cost pressures now and making sure the system is stronger into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there is more to do. My Labor colleagues and I come to work every day, sharply focused on reducing the cost of living for every Australian, making sure that the cost-of-living relief flows in a way that is carefully designed and calibrated for the conditions and the times that the country faces. Those opposite could play a constructive role; I invite them to do so.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KENNEDY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  The member for Dobell is right: they're trying. But they're not trying hard enough. The Governor of the Reserve Bank was taking the energy subsidies, for example, and saying they're going to look straight through them. They're a one-off subsidy and will have no effect on recurring inflation. So the government are trying, but they're not trying hard enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you a story that brings the true cost-of-living crisis and failure of the Albanese Labor government to life. Last week a woman contacted my office. She lives in Gymea. She's struggling to make ends meet. She looks after her severely disabled autistic son. Her rent has been dramatically increased, just a bit above the 14 per cent we're getting a year. She can't afford to pay her bills. She's trying to choose between rent, food and energy bills, and St Vincent de Paul in Gymea are trying to help her. They came as well to my office. This woman and her son are now facing homelessness. They're trying to get help from the state government. They can't find it, and they've come to my office as a last resort. When I speak to St Vincent de Paul in Gymea, this is one of many stories they're facing in my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: Australian households are in a recession, and they have been for over a year, and Australian households feel it. Australians feel it when they're paying their energy bills. They're up over 20 per cent. Australians feel it when they're paying their rent. It's up over 14 per cent. Australians feel it when they're paying their mortgage. They're paying $35,000 more than they were two years ago. Australians feel it when they're buying their groceries. Cereal is up over 25 per cent in the last two years. Australians feel it when they pay their income tax. They're paying 20 per cent more in personal income tax because of bracket creep than they were two years ago. And Australian first home owners feel it because they can't save for a home. Australians' savings are down 10 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: this is the fault of the Labor government. Australia has higher inflation than comparable economies. Australia's inflation is going up while in the rest of the world it is going down. The UK, the United States, across the ditch in New Zealand, Canada and the euro area all have lower inflation than Australia. Unlike Australia, their inflation is dropping. So why is Australia's inflation continuing to rise? Well, it's not the fault of the average Australian, and it's certainly not the fault of my constituent in Gymea. The Labor Party's spending addiction is driving up the cost of living for average Australians. Since coming to government, the Labor government has passed expansionary budgets—$315 billion in extra government spending. That's almost $30,000 per household. To all the Australian households out there, would you rather the Albanese government spent this extra $315 billion, $30,000 for each household, or would you rather have it in the bank? Not only did you not get the $30,000; you are being hit with higher prices, higher interest rates and more pain. The average Australian is literally paying higher prices for the Labor Party's bad decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the last budget, we can see what Anthony Albanese believes will solve this cost-of-living crisis. What's his answer? More government. What is his answer to the higher energy costs? A $300 subsidy. What is his answer to the higher childcare costs? More subsidies. What is his answer to low homeownership? The government will take equity in your home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Liberal Party we have different answers. While the Labor Party believes the answer to higher energy prices is a $300 subsidy, the Liberals believe in actually lowering prices. While the Labor Party believes the answer to higher childcare costs is greater childcare subsidies, the Liberal Party believes in actually lowering prices. The Labor Party believes the answer to low homeownership is the government owning part of your house. The Liberal Party believes it's lowering housing prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So how do we actually lower energy prices, child care or housing? We increase the supply. We want to increase the supply of clean and reliable energy, and not by closing power plants and not by writing off an entire technology before properly investigating it. We lower childcare prices by creating incentives for the private sector to build more childcare centres, not just subsidising demand. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of addressing the underlying problem, Labor believes in giving out subsidy after subsidy, but what will the Labor government do when the money runs out? When the subsidies run out, the underlying issues will still remain and average Australians will be left to pay the price. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHARLTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:46</span>):  It was a very impassioned speech by the shadow Treasurer. We all know that the shadow Treasurer has had a bit of trouble with his speeches over the last couple of years, the small problem being that he hasn't got any policies up in shadow cabinet. He hasn't got any tax policies up, any productivity policies, any economic reforms—absolute doughnut. In the absence of policies, he speaks in airy generalisations about things that he calls 'principles', and he has a name for these principles. He calls them his 'back to basics' principles. This is his back-to-basics economic approach, and, every chance he gets, he tells us about the contents of his back-to-basics economic approach. Now, I don't think he knows how the kids are using the term 'basic' these days. Nobody has had the heart to fill him in, but that's okay; for the shadow Treasurer, it's hip to be square. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question is: what is in this back-to-basics approach? What are the principles that he holds so dear? Principle No. 1 for him is smaller government; principle No. 2, which he talks about a lot, is competitive neutrality; and principle No. 3 is reducing regulation. So, after a big week of coalition policy, I thought I'd just do a quick welfare check on how the back-to-basics approach was going. Let's go through them one by one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back-to-basics principle No. 1 is smaller government. That has not had a good week. Unfortunately, that one really hit the rocks when his leader announced the biggest government funded program in Australian history. The shadow Treasurer has spent two years talking about spending less. He's been complaining about the housing fund and he's been complaining about the NRF, all $10 billion of it—all these off-balance-sheet funds that he says are a big waste of Australian taxpayers' money. It turns out the problem wasn't that they were off balance sheet; the problem was that they weren't big enough! Now he's got a $600 billion off-balance-sheet proposal. It's a beauty to behold! It's 60 times bigger than the housing fund. It's 10 times bigger than the NBN. It's four times bigger than the biggest policy in Australian history, JobKeeper. That used to be the most expensive policy. It pales into comparison to the $600 billion they want to spend on nuclear energy. So Peter Dutton has completely junked the pretence of smaller government. He's taken back-to-basics principle No. 1 outside and shot it in the back of the head.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker. His economic policy is less 'back to basics' now. It's more 'back to bolsheviks'! The Soviets would be proud of this; they'd really love it. Stalin had a five-year plan; the shadow Treasurer now has a 15-year plan. Brezhnev built three nuclear power plants in 20 years; the Liberals want to build seven in 10 years. This is about national ambition. The Soviets weren't ambitious enough! They didn't have the vision that the Liberals have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's do a quick check on principle No. 2: energy policy must be competitively neutral. That's what we heard from the shadow Treasurer. It was all about back to basics, not picking winners. Well, again, this principle really hit the fence last week. It hit the fence when it was jumped by the mother of all captain's picks in energy policy: nuclear power for all. The shadow Treasurer, the week before, was saying that energy infrastructure has to be commercial—'We don't want to subsidise the private sector.' His leader says, 'No. Let's put it on the government credit card.' Rolled again, unfortunately, and back-to-basics principle No. 2 disappears.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>Back-to-basics principle No. 3 is deregulation. This one is my favourite. The shadow Treasurer is very passionate about this. He doesn't want the dead hand of government getting involved in business. He doesn't want government telling businesses what to do. They should be out there employing people, driving economic growth. That's what he needs businesses to do. That's why important back-to-basics principle No. 3 is deregulation. Unfortunately, his leader had other ideas, again. When it comes to grocery prices, his leader has put forward the most statist, socialist, big-government, interventionist policy you could imagine! This policy made the Greens blush. It was so socialist the Greens had second thoughts. He doesn't just want to regulate; he wants to split them up. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  This government is making life harder for Australians. Everywhere you look, mums and dads are facing higher bills. Since this government came to power, the average mortgage in Australia has gone up thousands and thousands of after-tax dollars in every family budget. If you haven't got a mortgage, you're worse off, too: rents are up 14.2 per cent. There's a housing shortage, yet this government is overseeing the biggest immigration program, in the middle of a housing availability crisis. It's not just housing affordability; we're running out of houses and apartments, and we have record numbers of temporary migrants coming in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People don't realise that a lot of these temporary migrants aren't just on tourist visas; they are also here on student visas. They might end up studying here for four to five years. Some are in real courses, but many of them sign up for mickey mouse courses, get their student visa and go into the job market. They're not the high-skilled migrants we want. They stay here so long as temporary migrants that they qualify and are able to apply for the permanent migration system. Really, the permanent migration system, which is based on skills, is being filled in large part by those who have hung around long enough to apply for it. It is counterproductive when you're in the middle of a housing shortage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education costs are up. Everywhere that mums and dads in my electorate turn, prices are up. Education costs are up 11 per cent. Health costs are up 11.9 per cent. We've had some unsustainable wage rises. I know everyone wants a wage rise, but it has to be done gradually, without making inflation worse. Across-the-board wage rises of 25 per cent are not sustainable, but there are some professions in the health industry that have managed to wrangle that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an inflationary budget, with $315 billion in extra spending in the last budget. That is a mind-boggling amount of money when you don't have a national emergency like the COVID crisis or World War II. That increase is unbelievable when we're trying to get inflation down. Inflation eats away at the value of people's savings. The value of everything is reduced when inflation increases, and it's now up to 4.4 per cent. Our economic growth per head of population is not growing. Our gross GDP is growing but that is only because we have record rates of inflation. We need genuine economic growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the core of every industrial economy is the electricity system and the cost of liquid energy. Those two things drive everything in the post-industrial economies. What have we got? We've got a shortage of our own liquid fuel. We are having an absolute shortage of electricity. Many days there are warnings from AEMO that we don't have enough energy and we're going to be short on gas, yet this government is tying the gas industry up by not approving gas development. And gas is important for everything, not just energy—heating, industrial processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>Everywhere you go, things aren't working because of core problems. We are destroying our competitiveness and our economy by making our power generation expensive. Little do people realise that every year approximately $3.7 billion in green electricity subsidies get into their electricity bill. That is for the large-generation certificates and for the small-scale technology certificates and some other state subsidies. When you add all those up every year, that is almost getting to $4 billion a year. They are subsidies, and these renewable projects are going off the Richter scale. They are being waved through without any environmental checking, and that means there will be more large generating subsidies. A lot of these green energy projects are subsidy generating projects that are viable only because of subsidies, and that is one of the root causes of inflation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298121" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SITOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  My son, when he was three, really liked helping me bake cakes. When I say 'help' I use that term very loosely, because, when cracking an egg, there was often more eggshell than egg; measuring out milk, the quantities were all over the shop; and when he was helping to stir the batter, most of the batter ended up outside of the bowl. So when I think about the coalition's policies to help Australians, I often think about my son helping me bake a cake, because maybe the helping was more hindrance than help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's go through some of the things those opposite thought were going to be helpful. On the matter of wages, those opposite had as a deliberate design feature—they chose to do this; it was deliberate—to keep wages low. When asked to back an increase in the minimum wage for our lowest-paid workers, what did those opposite say? 'No thank you'. We on this side of the House have backed our lowest-paid workers by advocating for increases in the minimum wage not once, not twice but three times now. So a full-time worker, say a cleaner, on minimum wage has now seen their wage go up by $143 a week. Over a year, that is more than $7,000 in pay rises in just over two years for that worker. And that worker who is on a minimum wage earning about $45,000 a year is also going to get a tax cut thanks to the Albanese Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under those opposite—remember, they were trying to help here—that cleaner on a minimum wage would have got nothing. So if you are an Australian on the minimum wage, who would you think is helping? Would it be those opposite, who tried to suppress your wages, wouldn't back an increase in minimum wage, didn't want to give you a tax cut? Or would it be those on this side of the House, who have backed an increase in the minimum wage and have already delivered you a tax cut as of 1 July?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On energy prices: let's have a look at how those opposite were trying to help Australians who use energy. They made it near impossible for industry to invest in cheaper renewable energy by having 22 different energy policies, none of which they could land. They gave it a good red-hot go to try to help but could not land one. And now the one energy policy they have finally landed is the most expensive form of energy—nuclear. The other thing they did was vote against energy bill relief for Australian households. What are we on this side of the House doing? We are providing investors certainty by having good, quality policies on addressing climate change but encouraging investment in renewable energy. We have also voted for energy bill relief for households, and this week Australians will start to see some of that energy bill relief. If you are one of the 10 million Australian households who use energy, who do you think is helping here?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's move on to Australians that take medication. Those on the other side of the House voted against 60-day prescriptions—reform that would have made medicines cheaper. We on this side of the House have voted for 60-day prescription reform, and we have also implemented the largest cut in the maximum patient co-payment in the 75-year history of the PBS. If you are one of the five million Australians who has saved more than $400 million on your medicines, who would you say is helping?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's summarise here. If you are an Australian on minimum wage or an Australian who pays taxes or an Australian who takes medication or uses energy, who do you think is helping? I think the answer would be, resoundingly: those on this side of the House.</span>

                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  The member for Parramatta had a bit of pep in his step when he delivered his speech today. He seemed very happy today; I'm not sure why, but he was extremely happy. What was interesting was the subtlety of what he spoke about. In his five minutes, the member for Parramatta had a choice—to spend that five minutes defending the Treasurer's decisions or attacking the opposition. Interestingly, he didn't use that five minutes to defend the Treasurer; he spent it talking about the opposition, and it's not surprising. One thing that was interesting about the contribution from the member for Parramatta is that he mentioned nuclear. If the reports are true, he could be in the cabinet soon and able to really shape policy. If not, he has the option, as we now know, to cross the floor because in a past life the member for Parramatta was a strong advocate for nuclear energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to quote the member for Parramatta from a previous role—Quarterly Essay 44, <span style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span style="font-style:italic;">an-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ade </span><span style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">orld</span>: 'A single thousand-megawatt reactor produces the same power as 770 square kilometres of wind turbines. Nuclear power can also be scaled up. France added 48 gigawatts of nuclear capacity roughly equivalent to the entire capacity of Australia's electricity system in just over a decade. France now produces nearly 80 per cent of its power through nuclear reactors and has among the lowest emissions in the industrialised world'. I continue to quote: 'Nuclear power is, on many criteria, also better for the environment than currently available renewable technology. Massive volumes of concrete, steel, glass and rare elements will need to be mined and manufactured to produce solar panels and wind turbines if renewable energy facilities are rolled out at scale. Vast natural areas also need to be used as locations for solar facilities and wind farms. For this reason, some members of the green movement are starting to question the environmental costs of such projects.' Well, I look forward to the member for Parramatta arguing for nuclear in the caucus, or, if he doesn't get that promotion over the break, perhaps crossing the floor; he can join us. Let's see if he continues to hold that position. He said that many years ago; we know that's what he really thinks. Now he's got to follow the party line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To what we saw today: no wonder the Treasurer was quite angry in question time; he got rolled by the Prime Minister, as Phil Coorey reported today. He's got the member for Parramatta breathing down his neck, so it's no wonder he was a little bit angry and had to get warned a few times by the Speaker. We also saw today a prime minister that does not understand how the real world works. He does not understand anything about how it works in the real world. He was talking about the grocery code, and he made the statement—it was incredulous, and I have spent over a decade working in the grocery code—that 'If you sell a Woolworths, it will have to be replaced by Coles.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Guess what, Prime Minister? Maybe if you left the inner-city and you went to a regional or rural area, you would hear about these amazing things called IGAs or Foodlands—independent supermarkets run by a great organisation called Metcash. They're small and family owned businesses. They would love the opportunity to buy a site that has been landbanked by Woolworths and Coles. There's also a another great company called Aldi. <span style="font-style:italic;">Choice</span> recently showed that they're providing cheaper groceries—a different model to Woolworths and Coles, but I'm sure they would love some of those locations as well. We had the example about five or six years ago where a German company called Lidl was looking to launch in the Australian market. They spent a significant amount of time investigating launching and had staff on the ground, and they decided not to. One of the reasons why was they couldn't get appropriate locations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister saying that Woolworths and Coles are the only grocery channels of supermarkets that exist shows how out of touch he is with the Australian people. When he criticises this policy, it's because of ideology. He doesn't understand the pressure that Australian food manufacturers are under. I understand it because I've seen it and I've lived it. He doesn't understand the pressure that farmers are under. I understand it because my family have been in farming since the fifties. He has taken an ideological position. He has taken a position that will not reduce food and grocery prices. He is supporting big business at the expense of small business and Australian farmers, and every time he stands at that dispatch box and talks about the economy, he shows how out of touch he is. He shows that he really just does not get it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion because no government has done more to help with cost-of-living pressures than the Albanese Labor government. When the Albanese Labor government came to office two years ago, inflation, energy costs and interest rates—which are really the precursor to the cost-of-living pressures that we all face today—were all on the way up, so much so that the member for Hume, who put this motion forward, was the person who tried to cover or mask the energy price increases at that election. But the reality is that this government is conscious that cost-of-living pressures are hurting families and has implemented a whole suite of measures which, hopefully, time will allow me to go through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the member for Hume, after 10 minutes of ranting, he did not propose one solution to the problem that he claims he is so concerned about. All we heard was criticism of what we are doing on this side of the House. Let me tell anyone listening what we are doing. From 1 July, every taxpayer—that is, 13.6 million Australians—will get a tax cut. That means a tax cut, on average, of $1,500 a year. People earning under $45,000—who, under the coalition would have received nothing—will actually get a tax cut. These are people who need the tax cut the most. From 1 July every Australian household will receive $300 off their energy bills, and about a million small businesses will receive $325 off. We capped coal and gas prices to keep energy prices down, but those opposite opposed that legislation. We're getting wages moving. After a decade of Liberals and Nationals in government deliberately keeping wages low, this Labor government is getting wages moving again. We have supported three consecutive pay increases for the minimum wage, and we have delivered a historic 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers. We've taken the gender pay gap to a record low, we've banned pay secrecy clauses, we've made deliberate wage theft a crime and we've legislated on the 'same job, same pay' protections for casual workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got cheaper medicines, which were mentioned earlier on in this debate. In this budget we're providing $3 billion to support pharmacies and to keep the cost of medicines down. We're freezing the maximum cost of PBS prescriptions for a year, and that means that no-one will pay more than $31.60 for a PBS script. For Australians with pension or concession cards—again, some of the people that are struggling the most—we're freezing the price for five years so that those Australians won't have to pay more than $7.70 for the medicines they need. Then we've tripled the bulk-billing incentive. Today, more GP visits are being bulk-billed. That means that people that are struggling don't have to put their hand in their pocket whenever they go to see their GP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also providing relief for students by wiping $3 billion in student debt and changing the way that HELP loans are indexed to make it fairer and cheaper over the life of a loan. By backdating this change to mid-2023, we are able to provide debt relief in the form of HELP loan credits to more than three million Australians. We're also reducing financial barriers for the next generation of nurses, midwives, teachers and social workers by providing prac payments to support them whilst they are undertaking their compulsory placements. As we heard again in question time today, we've provided some 400,000 fee-free TAFE places. We also go into the issue of consumers at the checkouts, which, again, has been talked about today. We're making sure that Australians get a fair deal at the checkout by holding supermarkets to account with a strong competition watchdog and making the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct mandatory. We're moving towards six months of paid parental leave with the flexibility to choose how to split it between parents, and we're introducing paid super on government paid parental leave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, we're providing the first back-to-back increases to Commonwealth Rent Assistance in more than 30 years. On top of the 15 per cent increase in our last budget, this year we are delivering a further 10 per cent increase as well as the $32 billion housing plan, which will ensure there are more houses in Australia. That is the best way we can reduce the cost of housing and renting. What do we hear from those opposite?

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  Unfortunately, quite sadly, this government is letting down everyday Australians. Right across this country, particularly in my electorate, Fadden, people are doing it tough. You only have to walk down the main street of Labrador, Coombabah, Pacific Pines or Pimpama to see that people are hurting. When you talk to them, when you walk with those people, when you listen to what they say, they are hurting under a terrible Labor government. I notice that there are quite a few people in the gallery here today, which is wonderful—for them to observe our democracy. I just wonder what's going through their minds, whether they think they're better off now than they were two years ago under a competent coalition government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we enter the new financial year, everyone on the Labor side of the House has been promising that life will be easier because they're delivering their stage 3 tax cuts. That's what we heard on 1 July—magically, everything is going to get better. The problem is this: these tax cuts are a drop in the ocean compared to the damage that has been done to the Australian household. The cost of living is, quite frankly, completely out of control. And it's because of the failed Labor government's budget that the household budget is hurting so badly—reckless spending, Jimflation continuing to rise, making everyone's lives more expensive.</span>

                  </a>  I've been here five minutes, and I can see already how incompetent you all are. So here's the lesson. When you spend an extra $315 billion over two years, the economy can overheat. This causes Jimflation to spike. So, when inflation goes up, what that means is that the cost of everything is going up for every Australian. On the other hand, if you use some self-control, inflation tends to stay lower. On this side of the House, what we know is that high inflation is very, very bad for the everyday Australian. This Labor government isn't fooling anyone when it tries to spin inflation as being a worldwide phenomenon. It's not. Other major economies are seeing relief in inflation while ours, here in Australia, is homegrown and continues to skyrocket.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve better than this. Families and small businesses shouldn't be struggling this hard. What those opposite fail to understand is that inflation hits people hard at home. It's an amount of money that is continuing to grow. The costs are going up exponentially. This is what happens—four per cent on four per cent on four per cent. It's really not that hard to understand why people can't afford groceries and why they can't afford their power bills. </span>

                  </a>  My friend opposite has made a very good use of the word 'compounding'. Let's use that. Four per cent plus four per cent plus four per cent—what's happening? Prices are going up. Australians, quite frankly, cannot afford this Labor government. They deserve better. They were promised that power prices were going down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's another little bit of maths, and perhaps those opposite can help out: you promised that power bills would go down by $275, and instead they have gone up by $1,000. Should we work this out? If in fact they have gone up by $1,000 a year in the last two years, is that anything relevant to a $275 promise for them to go down? No. It's going in completely the wrong direction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are paying 20 per cent more in personal tax, and this is the part where it really hurts Australian families. Homeowners with a typical mortgage of about $750,000 are nearly $35,000 worse off after tax. The levels of damage achieved by this Albanese Labor government over the past two years are astonishing, but it's heartbreaking for Australians, because they can't afford the incompetence of this government. They look forward to the next election to return a coalition government who will be responsible economic managers.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance raised by the member for Hume. Due to an indiscretion, I wasn't here in person to see the member for Hume's speech, so I got to watch it from up in my office. When you're sitting watching someone speak, you're invariably drawn to the people behind the speaker in the frame. The member for Hume had 10 minutes to talk about cost-of-living issues. He spent a lot of time talking about Labor reshuffles. It was quite bizarre. He chose the topic of public importance and then spoke about Labor reshuffles like that was the most important thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I was sitting there, watching the member for Hume and then being drawn to the people in the frame behind him, it was a great lesson in body language. If you're ever unfortunate enough to be thrown out under 94(a)—it does happen to some of us. I was watching the body language of the backbenchers behind the member for Hume, and it was like a lesson in the phrase: 'Oh my God. What have we done?' They were sitting there on the backbench saying, 'This guy is in front of me.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of reshuffles, the member for Hume is calling for a Labor reshuffle, offering commentary on a Labor reshuffle. Obviously, the member for Dickson, the Leader of the Opposition, needs to do some serious reshuffling. My 15-year-old has more economic credibility than the member for Hume. I hope you're not listening to this, Leo. But, seriously, we saw it in question time today—issue after issue after issue where the member for Hume has been rolled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the way to assist Australians is to help them out during a cost-of-living crisis. We do know that. We know that people are doing it tough, and we don't just stand around and say: 'Oh, gee! Times are tough.' We are actually doing those practical things so that, from the next pay packet that the people in my electorate receive, they'll get some assistance. We know, when it comes to their power bills, whether they're an individual household or a small business, that they'll receive some benefit from us. And I do note that the Labor government in Queensland has given an extra $1,000. The previous speaker is a Queensland MP. He forgot to mention that the Queensland Labor government's giving people a $1,000 cut on their power bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Casey's speech was a little bit bizarre in that he just read out an essay that Andrew Charlton, the member for Parramatta, wrote years ago. But the previous speaker was talking about inflation as if it magically occurred. I remember the last coalition budget. Inflation was running hot, so they just got a big bucket of lighter fluid, squirted it down the bottom and said, 'Look at that fire go!' A change of government happens, and then they're saying, 'Geez, there's a lot of smoke and flames; the economy is in trouble when it comes to inflation,' as if we could put it out overnight just by electing a Labor government. That's not how inflation works. It takes a long time to get inflation under control. Labor understand that, because Labor people are the ones who suffer most when it comes to inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is heading in the right direction. We know that people have less money to spend, effectively, if they're a pay-as-you-go person, and many of them are the people that we have targeted our tax packages to. They're the people that we're trying to give energy relief. These are all things that we're doing to make sure that we get inflation under control. The last budget of the coalition was a disaster when it came to getting the economy under control and left us with a trillion dollars in debt, effectively, throughout any lingering soupcon of economic credibility leftover from the Howard years. It was all gone.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Standing orders must be suspended in order to urgently consider the private member's bill to establish a judicial inquiry into antisemitism at Australian universities. The Prime Minister must stop his attempts to shut down debate on this issue of antisemitism, as the government has done repeatedly and as recently as this morning, with coalition attempts to condemn the desecration of our sacred war memorials that were daubed with anti-Semitic slogans. This is the third time I have sought to bring on debate on this bill. It's been a week since the last time I sought to have the House consider this bill and almost a month since I first introduced it. That is long enough for the Prime Minister have thought about it and considered it. It's time he acted and allowed debate on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Semester 2 is now less than a month away. The antisemitism which has been rife on campus for years before 7 October and has only escalated since that time cannot be allowed to continue. Since I first introduced this bill to the House, antisemitism in Australian universities has become worse. Just last week, I met with Jewish university staff and Jewish university students who implored me to continue this fight. Every day, non-Jewish university administrators, academics and even university council members contact me and tell me to keep going with this bill, and we have to keep going. We have Jewish academics leaving the sector. We have Jewish students leaving their courses. These aren't isolated incidents, and they're not without precedent. We know that what happens on campus today affects the culture of Australia tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think one of the worst things we have seen is the University of Sydney's appeasement of the extremist organisation Hizb ut-Tahrir. This should ring alarm bells for the Prime Minister, for the defence minister, for the education minister, for the Attorney-General and, indeed, for every member of this House. Australian universities will play a critical role in delivering AUKUS. At a time when we need our best and brightest minds to develop the research capabilities Australia needs for our defence and security alliances, Sydney university has forfeited its right to participate. Sydney university's capitulation to extremist groups is so alarming. The idea that groups linked to Hizb ut-Tahrir will now have a seat at the table, running the ruler over Sydney university's defence contracts, beggars belief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hizb ut-Tahrir is a group that has been listed as a terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom and in Germany and banned in many Muslim countries. In doing deals like this, Australian universities are risking our security and our international relationships. Sydney university's actions have been condemned by a coalition of Jewish groups, including the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the Australasian Union of Jewish Students, the Zionist Federation of Australia, the Australian Academic Alliance Against Antisemitism and the Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council. In a joint letter to Sydney university, the Jewish group said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Based on our interactions to date, we have lost confidence in the capacity of the University to provide for the physical, cultural and psycho-social safety of Jewish students and staff members. This is not just our view. We have been made aware that several academic staff, some of them leaders in their fields and employees of long standing, have already notified the University of their decision to leave the institution. We have also been informed that a number of Jewish students are now considering shifting to other Universities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have also rejected the University's offer, extended to us after an agreement had been reached behind our backs, to participate in the proposed process to review the University's investment and research activities. The process is in our view a sham and we will have nothing to do with it. We encourage all individuals and groups of standing likewise not to engage with or lend credibility to such a fundamentally flawed process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We continue to explore all options to ensure the safety and wellbeing of students and staff at the University of Sydney and stand ready to provide support and assistance to Jewish students and staff at the University, as well as those who now wish to leave the University.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bullying behaviour of Hizb ut-Tahrir and the encampments is all part of a broader movement of boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel—an antisemitic movement that seeks to judge and treat Israel by different standards than any other nation. A movement that had died in Australia that has been given new life by the inaction of vice-chancellors, and now it's spreading to other areas of Australian society because of that inaction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With council elections only weeks away, Sydney city council and Sydney's lord mayor, Clover Moore, are looking for relevance. Instead of focusing on delivering the services a council is responsible for, the lord mayor has embarked on a foray into foreign policy, with a BDS campaign against Israel. The lord mayor has looked at Sydney university's weakness and capitulation to extremist organisations. She's looked to Canberra and seen the complete lack of leadership coming from this government. Now, empowered, she too can join the antisemitic BDS crusade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The apathy towards antisemitism in Australia is startling, and it's having a damaging impact right across our country. Last weekend, not far from here, memorials dedicated to honouring the lives and service of Australians at war were vandalised with antisemitic slogans like 'from the river to the sea'. If you fail to address this issue in hotbeds like universities, the consequences in other areas of our society are inevitable. A judicial inquiry is the only way we can get to the bottom of the scourge of antisemitism infecting our universities. It's the only way witnesses will feel safe enough to divulge their experiences, free from retribution. It's the only way that university chancellors and vice-chancellors will be cross-examined and held to account for their failure to act at universities. It's the only way we will receive findings and recommendations to deal with an issue that's been plaguing the sector for years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than having a standalone judicial inquiry into antisemitism on campus, the government's current policy is to have a general antiracism inquiry conducted by the Australian Human Rights Commission. Australia's Jewish community has no confidence in the Australian Human Rights Commission, with antisemitism rife among its staff, and its commissioners turning a blind eye to the antisemitism infecting our country. This House should have no confidence in the Human Rights Commission. An organisation riddled with an apparent disregard for the human rights of Jewish Australians is no place for an inquiry of this kind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting to me that the only commissioner of the Human Rights Commission that has made any speech condemning antisemitism since 7 October is Lorraine Finlay, the one commissioner whose appointment was repeatedly attacked by this Attorney-General, while his hand-picked Race Discrimination Commissioner cannot bring himself to admit that 'from the river to the sea' is a violent phrase. Where is the Attorney-General, the minister responsible for the benighted organisation which is the Australian Human Rights Commission? He's said practically nothing about the rampant antisemitism on our campuses or the systemic racism against Jews which exists at the Human Rights Commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Enough is enough. Antisemitism on our campuses is out of control, and we are now only weeks away from the resumption of classes for semester two. That's why standing orders need to be suspended so that this House can consider the bill so that all members of this House will have the opportunity to stand with Australia's Jewish community and stand against antisemitism on campus. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know universities are ground zero for antisemitism and we are now seeing it filter into other aspects of life. We have seen it in the horrific terrorist attacks on the offices of members of parliament, in particular the member for Macnamara's electorate office. We are seeing a situation across the board where MPs and their staff are unsafe in their offices. This is not normal. This is not okay. This complete breakdown of law and order seems to be accepted by some, encouraged as it is even by some members of this House, especially the Australian Greens. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the Prime Minister and all those opposite: What will it take? What else needs to happen for them to be convinced that antisemitism in Australian universities is rife and has the potential for devastating consequences? What will it take to convince them that antisemitism in Australian universities deserves a proper inquiry conducted by an independent jurist rather than the kangaroo court that is the Human Rights Commission? I also ask those opposite: do they want to be the ones regretting not having taken a stand when they could have?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an opportunity for the Prime Minister to show leadership and send a message to Australia's Jewish community that he's actually serious about dealing with antisemitism in the way that the Jewish community has demanded: with a standalone judicial inquiry into antisemitism on campus. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout last year, the Prime Minister repeatedly quoted the Jewish sage Hillel when he said the words: 'If not us, then who? If not now, then when?' Let me ask the Prime Minister the same question about the judicial inquiry into antisemitism on campus: if not you, then who? If not now, then when?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  I second the motion. There was a recent university survey done by the Social Research Centre that showed 64 per cent of Australian Jewish university students have experienced antisemitism at university—64 per cent. Over half of all Jewish students, 57 per cent, have hidden their identity at university to avoid antisemitism. Three-quarters, 76 per cent, of Jewish students would be more confident about making complaints if their university adopted a definition of what antisemitism is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen some of the most grotesque actions by those who would seek to bring the Jewish community down, not just in Australia but across the world. In particular, the ground zero of where we've seen it is at these so-called place of enlightenment. We've seen it at these so-called places of enlightenment not just in Australia but across the world, the Western world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's just concentrate on Australia where we, in this place, can make a difference. The member for Berowra has moved this motion on three occasions, and, on each occasion, the government has effectively gagged this motion. I say that is atrocious. That is appalling. This is an opportunity for the government to show leadership. This is an opportunity for the government to demonstrate that it supports the more than 100,000 Jews living in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at a function in Sydney a couple of weekends ago and I met a young gentleman in his early 30s. I didn't know him from a bar of soap. He came up to me, he hugged me and he said his name. He said, 'I just want you to know: thank you for what you're doing in relation to Israel.' He started to tell me about how his grandparents were survivors of the Holocaust. He said, 'I just want you to know this is the first time in my life where, as a Jew, I have felt unsafe in Australia.' He told me, 'I am seriously, seriously considering moving my family to Israel.' This guy was very intelligent. He was telling me that he is thinking about moving to Israel. I had another gentleman, who is a principal of a school, speak to me. Guess what? He has probably already moved now. He was telling me that he and his wife are moving back to Israel because they felt safer living in Israel—in a war zone—than living in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How could we have got this so wrong? In our universities, the places of so-called enlightenment, people like Mark Scott, vice-chancellor of the University of Sydney, are saying, 'This is a matter of free speech.' How could we have got this so wrong? It reminds me of the Greens saying, 'Well, it's okay to deface our war memorials because that's a matter of free speech.' What is happening to this country?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night I spoke about how the far left are now so aggressively hating on the Jewish community and the far right are so aggressively—and have been for many years—hating on the Jewish community. We've got the far left and the far right coming up around the back and meeting. We are losing our way in this country, and we are losing our way because of the lack of leadership in this country. This country needs a leader who will stand up and say: 'Enough is enough. This is unacceptable.' Jews, no matter where they are—whether they're at university, at work, at schools or on the playgrounds—have just as much right to an education and to live life as every other Australian.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2024 that I've tabled repeals the general rate of duty for 457 tariff classifications and replaces the rate with 'Free'. The free rate of duty will apply to goods imported on or after 1 July 2024. These alterations will cut compliance costs and make it easier to import a range of goods, including household items such as toothbrushes, washing machines and electric blankets and certain clothing and footwear. Eliminating customs duties for these goods will mean cheaper goods for Australians and less complicated compliance for Australian businesses. The 457 tariff classifications have been selected because, although they have a general rate of five per cent, the widespread use of tariff concessions and preferential rates mean that few, if any, importers pay the five per cent rate. Reducing the general rate of customs duty means importers will continue to be able to claim a free rate of customs duty without having to undertake the additional steps and paperwork required to claim concessional preferential rates of duty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure that Australia is meeting its commitments to free trade agreement partners, this proposal also includes alterations to schedule 14 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995. These alterations ensure that the preferential rates of customs duty for goods that are originating under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement are not higher than the general rate of duty. Aside from schedule 3, schedule 14 is the only schedule to the Customs Tariff Act in which preferential customs duty rates have not already been incrementally reduced to free in respect of some of the 457 tariff headings and subheadings affected by this measure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2024 proposes to amend section 18B of the Customs Act 1995 to extend concessional treatment of imported goods that are the produce or manufacture of Ukraine for a further 24 months. From 4 July 2022 these goods, other than petroleum, fuel, tobacco and alcohol products, have been able to claim a free rate of customs duty on import. This was due to end on 3 July this year. The goods will now be able to continue to access concessional treatment until 3 July 2026. The extension of concessional treatments supports Ukraine's continued participation in international trade and is a demonstration of Australia's continued and unwavering support for Ukraine and its people. The tariff relief is one part of Australia's package of defence, economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank everyone who's contributed to this important debate. I'm pleased by the broad support that this bill has now received. It's great that members and senators across the parliament have recognised the importance of this positive action the Albanese Labor government is taking to back small businesses. I also want to thank Dr Craig Emerson for his work on the independent review of the Payment Times Reporting Act and thank the many businesses and organisations that engaged in consultations as part of the review process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Emerson found that the scheme legislated by the former government was a 'poorly functioning reporting scheme', which is why the Albanese Labor government wasted no time in legislating Dr Emerson's recommendations. We know how important cash flow is for small businesses. This bill is an overhaul of the Payment Times Reporting Act 2020 to improve payment times from big businesses to their small business suppliers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government's reforms will increase transparency and identify best and worst payers whilst reducing the regulatory burden on reporting entities. Labor is the party of small business. We stand for fairness for small business, and we're delivering greater fairness for small businesses, which are crucial to our local communities and to the broader Australian economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government makes foreign policy for our nation. The Australian government recognises states. But I move this motion today on behalf of the Australian government because the Greens and others are deliberately misleading the Australian public about the government's position on recognising a Palestinian state. The Albanese government has been clear that we will recognise Palestine as part of a peace process in support of a two-state solution and a just and enduring peace. We want to see a Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel. No Australian government has ever expressed such strong support for a Palestinian state. This is reflected in what we tried to put to the Senate last week. We are doing more than just lecturing and condemning people; we are working with countries around the world that want a just and enduring peace in the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the recent vote at the UN General Assembly, 143 countries, including Australia, expressed an aspiration for Palestinian membership of the UN. Australia and a number of other countries, including Germany, the UK and Canada, have shifted our position so that recognition of a Palestinian state is no longer seen as being the end point of negotiations. To help realise a Palestinian state, we have asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to look at what role Australia can play in supporting reform of the Palestinian Authority so that it can deliver on the needs of the Palestinian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The conflict in the Middle East has spanned our entire lifetime. The fact is that the Albanese government is working with the international community to create momentum for a lasting peace in the form of a two-state solution—a Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel. The foreign minister has been clear in what we want to see in progressing a two-state solution and recognition of a Palestinian state. Firstly, we see no role for Hamas. Hamas is a terrorist organisation. Secondly, a Palestinian state cannot be in a position to threaten Israel's security. Thirdly, we want to see a reformed Palestinian governing authority that is committed to peace, that disavows violence and that is ready to engage in a meaningful political process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There needs to be serious progress on security and governance reforms and the final status of core issues such as Jerusalem, and the borders of a future Palestinian state should be determined through direct negotiations. But we emphasise that there is no long-term security for Israel unless it is recognised by the countries in its region. The normalisation agenda that was being pursued before October 7 cannot proceed without progress on a Palestinian state. Saudi Arabia has said that there will be no diplomatic relations with Israel unless an independent Palestinian state is recognised. We also know that recognising a Palestinian state undermines Hamas and undermines Iran—and Iran's other destructive proxies in the region. Peacemaking is hard. It requires real leadership by serious people. It requires those of us who are not central players in this conflict to support those who are in the hard work of progressing a two-state solution to this conflict. We know that this is the only way to break the cycle of violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that some members of the Greens are walking away from a two-state solution. Presumably, that is because some members of the Greens think that there should be no State of Israel, just as some in the opposition think there should be no state of Palestine. We even saw Senator Sharma, who should know better, hosting an event in Parliament House for extremists who are campaigning against a two-state solution. These fringe views in the Greens and the opposition condemn both Palestinians and Jews in the Middle East to endless war and suffering. They also seek to position Australia outside the international community that is building momentum on Palestinian recognition and a two-state solution. Presumably, this is why they joined together to reject Labor's amendment in the Senate recently. What matters in the region is the actions of governments, not political games in parliaments on the other side of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Australia is not a central player, we have a respected voice and we are using it to advocate for a ceasefire, for the protection of civilians, for increased humanitarian assistance and for the release of hostages. When I travel to the region and speak to representatives of countries that have influence in the region, they are completely oblivious to these political stunts. My counterparts in those countries don't raise Senate motions with me, let alone failed Senate motions. Instead, they welcome the constructive role that the Australian government has been playing since October 7.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the start of this conflict, I have used the Australian government's respected voice to make our case in Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Israel. What the people I have met with in these countries care about are the substantive actions of our government. I can tell you that our actions are respected as constructive contributions to minimising the human suffering from this conflict and for promoting a peace process and a two-state solution. We are using our voice in international institutions and forums.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is more than six months since Australia voted with 152 countries for a ceasefire at the United Nations. In May Australia supported expanded Palestinian rights to participate in UN forums and the General Assembly's aspiration for eventual Palestinian membership of the United Nations, consistent with a two-state solution. We have also joined with our partners to amplify our voice at prime ministerial level alongside Canada and New Zealand in December and February, alongside the UK defence and foreign ministers in March and alongside foreign ministers from the UK, Canada, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and other partners in a letter to Foreign Minister Katz in May, opposing Israel's operation in Rafah. We have pushed for safe, unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access and contributed to the international humanitarian response: committing $72.5 million to address urgent needs arising from the conflict in Gaza and the protracted refugee crisis; delivering ADF aerial delivery parachutes for use in humanitarian assistance airdrops by Jordan and the UAE; supporting the UN humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator's work on aid coordination and deconfliction in Gaza; and we have pressed the Netanyahu government directly, publicly and privately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The foreign minister has written to her counterpart, including following the shocking and unacceptable strikes in Rafah. Australia's ambassador has made representations to senior Israeli officials on numerous occasions. Our senior officials have made representations to Israel's ambassador in Canberra. We have used our voices in dozens of engagements with foreign counterparts, including those with influence in the region. We have been consistent and clear in our call for international law and international humanitarian law to be upheld, including the protection of civilians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been calling for restraint from the very start. We've been securing the passage of a parliamentary motion calling for the protection of civilian lives and observance of international law in October 2023. We've been clear in our respect and support for the independence of the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. We will deny anyone identified as an extremist settler a visa to travel to Australia. This is what Labor governments achieve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to office, and well before the current conflict started, the Albanese government has taken steps to support a two-state solution and a just and enduring peace. We have affirmed that settlements are illegal under international law and a significant obstacle to peace. We have adopted the language of the Occupied Palestinian Territories, consistent with the approach taken by key partners. We reversed the Morrison government's decision to recognise West Jerusalem as a capital of Israel, reaffirming Australia's longstanding and bipartisan position that Jerusalem is a final status issue to be resolved through negotiations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We doubled the Australian government's core funding to UNRWA, from $10 million to $20 million, and we've called out unilateral actions that undermine the prospects of peace in a two-state solution, including terrorism, violence and incitement, settlement activity, settler violence, demolitions and displacement. We've done that because Labor governs for all Australians. We're a party of progress, not a party of protest. We listen to all Australians and we represent all Australians. We don't talk for some Australians; we don't simply represent some Australians. We represent everyone. We seek to bring Australians together in challenging times, not to divide them in pursuit of short-term political gain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our foreign policy begins with our identity, it begins with who we are. Australia is a country where half of us were either born overseas or have a parent born overseas. We're a diverse and pluralist society, a society where necessarily, understandably we will disagree, but we're a society, we're a nation where we will continue get along. We will need to live together, side-by-side, with people who have different views to us in our workplaces, in our sporting clubs, in our schools and in our communities. We need to be able to disagree respectfully and retain our cohesion as a nation. That takes leadership, and that's what this government is providing here, at home and in the region where this conflict is occurring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this motion I invite the chamber to join with the government in this effort, to join in providing the leadership that we need for peace building in the Middle East and for social cohesion here at home.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  On 7 October, 1,200 innocent men, women and children were murdered at the hands of the murderous terrorist organisation Hamas in Israel. Israel is the only multiparty democracy in the Middle East. It is a longstanding ally and security partner of Australia, and this country has consistently voted with a range of like-minded nations in the United Nations on a range of matters in relation to Israel, recognising the fundamental democratic values that the state of Israel embodies and recognising that it is very important to send a clear message to those who are supporting and encouraging murderous terrorist activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen from the government just now is a motion that has been moved with no notice to the opposition. The assistant minister has scuttled into this place to move this motion without bothering to give any notice to this side of the House, showing contempt for the millions of people who are represented by those of us on this side of the House on a matter of such extraordinary sensitivity in our community, at a time when there is, across our community and across our nation, a significant component of our population that feels unsafe. What we have seen is a conspicuous failure of leadership by this weak Prime Minister and by this weak government, and we have seen that consistent pattern repeated by the assistant minister. If this was something they were proud of, they would have notified the opposition, but they have not bothered to do that. You have to ask, 'What is going on here?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is going on here, very clearly, is a government that has abandoned longstanding principles on the basis of short-term political considerations. I say to the government, to every member of this House and to every Australian: if we have just seen a murderous terrorist attack with 1,200 innocent men, women and children killed and some 200 people taken hostage, some of whom are still kept in the tunnels under Gaza, all of us want to see a secure and lasting peace, and the way that peace is to be achieved is in the hands of the murderous terrorist thugs who control Gaza. It is in the hands of the murderous terrorist organisation Hamas. What we have just seen from this government, from this weak Prime Minister, is a decision to reward terrorism and to reward terrorists. That is what we have just seen from this weak government and this weak prime minister.</span>

                  <a href="13050" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  On 11 June this year I represented our foreign minister at the Urgent Humanitarian Response to Gaza Conference in Jordan. The conference was convened by King Abdullah II of Jordan, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt, and Antonio Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General. There were three themes to that conference, the first being the need and the scale of humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza. There was a call from the international community to commit to more humanitarian aid, and I was honoured at that forum to announce the Australian government was committing another $10 million to the World Food Programme, bringing our level of aid to the region up to $72½ million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second theme was the distribution and the need for the unimpeded flow of aid into Gaza and, again, for the international community to continue to demand that the Israeli government comply by its obligations under international humanitarian law to enable the safe passage of aid through the most effective land routes into Gaza to the people who need it most. The third theme was the psychosocial recovery and the restoration of human dignity to the people of Gaza. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk a lot of politics in this place and there is a lot of politicking happening around this issue. Just yesterday, I watched as the member for Griffith came in here and gave a 90-second statement on Gaza and then sat down and laughed. He laughed. But the political noise happening here is so vastly disconnected from the conversations in the region, conversations led by countries at the forefront, led by aid agencies and individuals on the ground in Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key message that I took away from my time in Jordan, where I met with leaders from across the world who were present there, was the great appreciation for what this Australian government has done to make a real difference, a material difference, to the people of Gaza. From our UN votes to our aid contributions, there was an acknowledgement that Australia is punching above its weight in our commitment and our support for peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been proud and honoured to represent my country at a number of international fora, both before and during my time in this parliament. I have represented Australia at the White House and as a UN expert advisor in places like Kenya and Vienna. I have sat in those rooms with leaders from around the world and spoken on behalf of my country on our position from an academic perspective. But I have never been more proud to serve and represent this Australian government at an international forum than I was in Jordan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, we put forward a motion that reaffirms our commitment to peace and, through this motion, we send a very clear message to those people in Gaza and in the occupied territories that we support their aspirations for self-determination, that we support their aspirations for a just and enduring peace. As the assistant minister said, recognition of Palestine won't come about by votes in here or in the Senate, but what we are doing today is important. That message that we send is important but it is no less important than what we have done as a government, as a collective, to continue to make that difference to the children, to the women, to the innocent men, to the innocent people in Gaza and in the occupied territories who have suffered for way too long and who aspire only for a life of peace and for an enduring and sustainable peace. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  Before the election senior Labor officials wrote in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Jewish News</span> that there was no difference between the Labor Party and the coalition on policies relating to Israel and on policies relating to the Jewish community. There were op-eds written by the Attorney-General and by the member for Macnamara.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have seen since the election there has been a greater gulf between the position of the Labor Party and the coalition in relation to Israel and the Jewish community, and we saw this before 7 October. We saw this in relation to changing the capital of Israel—a decision that was bungled, without consultation of the Jewish community in Australia and without proper warning to the government of Israel. I happened to be in Israel a couple of weeks after, and in meeting after meeting we were asked to explain why this had happened and how it had happened in this way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw it in relation to the return of funding to UNRA. UNRA is the UN organisation whose headquarters in Gaza, sadly, had been used as a major communications facility for Hamas, and some of its employees had been involved in the 7 October terrorist attacks. It had been a negative actor in the Middle East even before that time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen it in changes to votes in the United Nations in relation to the position of Palestine and in relation to the position of Israel, and we're now seeing it in relation to the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House support the idea of a two-state solution—a state of Israel and a state of Palestine living side by side. But the question is about the timing of the preconditions that need to exist before a Palestinian state should be recognised by Australia. The Australian foreign policy tradition is that we don't recognise states that haven't yet come into existence. It might interest the House to know that we didn't recognise the State of Israel, when it came into existence, until it proved that it could defend itself, almost nine months later. We make the recognition after the fact, not before the fact. It's important that we don't recognise a state that hasn't come into existence, particularly when many of the actors in that state do not believe that Israel has a right to exist. That has always been a precondition for the recognition of a Palestinian state, in terms of Australian foreign policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But you cannot consider this motion without considering the context and the timing of the change in the government's position in relation to the recognition of a Palestinian state. This was not something they brought in before 7 October. This is a matter that they have pursued since 7 October. The events of 7 October were so dreadful—the largest number of Jewish people murdered in a single day since the Holocaust. And it was not just murder but sadistic murder and the rape of children, the rape of women, the beheading of people and the capture of babies and Holocaust survivors. There are still more than a hundred hostages who were taken by Hamas who have not been returned and are somewhere in Gaza today. To recognise a Palestinian state after that event sends all the wrong signals internationally. It says to people—a bit like the University of Sydney said—that the more you push, the more violent you are and the less you want to come to the table and make peace, the more you will be rewarded. I think that's a terrible precedent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we think about the world on 6 October, Israel had been going round making peace with its neighbours. The Abraham accords were a game changer. Relations between Israel and its neighbours had never been better, and the Saudi deal was so close. The Hamas terrorists wanted to interrupt and degrade that because they felt that their cause would be forgotten if Israel and Saudi Arabia normalised relations. The events on 7 October have been a complete disrupter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's really important that we as Australia stand with a like-minded liberal democracy, which is Israel. I look forward to a like-minded liberal democracy in the state of Palestine at some point in the future. But that requires the Palestinian people to make the decision that the people of Israel have a right to exist and that there deserves to be a Jewish homeland in the land of Israel as well as a homeland for the Palestinian people. Until they recognise Israel's right to exist, which so many of the leading actors do not, the prospect of a Palestinian state is not something that we as Australians should be considering, and it's not something that underpins the fundamental values of Western democracy that Australia has always stood for.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  I've supported the cause for Palestinian self-determination and statehood for decades—a goal, a vision, of a two-state solution within a just and enduring peace. My family has fought for that for decades. My father, my grandfather and my uncles fought in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973 in the Egyptian army. In my electorate of Wills I have assisted families to get their loved ones out of Gaza and here to Australia, and I've engaged with the Palestinian and Muslim communities in my electorate for years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During this conflict I've listened to their pain and their loss, and I've reflected that back in my work within the Labor Party, a party of government that can shape policies that can actually achieve material outcomes on the ground, working with the international community. That is why it is so disappointing, so disgusting, that there are elected representatives in the Greens political party that would use this tragedy, which has spanned more than seven decades, for base political purposes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When they accuse the Labor government of being complicit in genocide, it is not only vile; it is false. What we are responsible for—to cut through all the misinformation and disinformation and the peddling of lies—is condemnation of the loss of all innocent civilian lies, the Israeli lives on 7 October and the Palestinian lives during the course of the war. What we are responsible for is taking a principled position to use our diplomatic efforts to end the war and return the hostages. What we are responsible for is voting for a ceasefire at the United Nations. What we are responsible for is increasing humanitarian aid, over $70 million to help alleviate human suffering. What we are responsible for and have done is work with the international community to end this conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have no doubt all of us in this place want this conflict to end. All of us here want an end to human suffering, an end to the almost endless cycle of violence that has spanned decades and decades. But to use this conflict and this tragedy for short-term political gain is below contempt. As a government we have done and are doing the material work to end this conflict, to reach a two-state solution and a just and enduring peace. I as a backbencher have engaged with ambassadors whose countries are involved directly in the negotiation for a ceasefire. I've engaged with our Prime Minister, our foreign minister, our colleagues on the frontbench on the policies around Palestinian recognition and statehood. And I've advocated for a substantive and constructive contribution that Australia should make in support of Palestinian statehood and a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security. That is real work. These are real outcomes. That is work that we do for peace, a world where Palestinians and Israelis can live side by side in peace and security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That world doesn't come or cannot ever materialise from stunt motions by minor parties in the Senate. That doesn't come or cannot come from spreading misinformation in order to whip up anger, scorn and division based on lies. As elected representatives, we have an obligation to unite Australians and to protect the harmonious multicultural society we have built up here over decades. Australians don't want these conflicts and violence to be on our streets. Australians want a government that provides humanitarian support for those in need and that does its job on the international stage towards the goal of peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion that we have brought before the House clearly states our government's position—that we support the recognition of a state of Palestine as part of a two-state solution and a just and enduring peace process. That is our clear and principled position. It forms the basis for all the actual work that we do as members of parliament and as ministers to support that peace process. And we do that on the international stage because it is our responsibility and obligation as a good international citizen. That is a principled position that we can all stand firmly behind. It is the material work that we have done and that we will continue to do day after day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  With what remains of the hospitals full of limbless children, malnutrition setting in and Gaza in ruins, it's a humanitarian catastrophe. This is not an opinion or politics; this is reality. It's also a fact that the terrorist group Hamas continues to hold Israeli hostages in captivity. Their families have endured months of hell, and the impact of October 7 has given rise to real and deep-seated fear among Jewish people across the world, including here in Australia, with a huge spike in antisemitic abuse. This is also not opinion or politics; this is reality. The twin pain of these two groups of people co-exists. One does not cancel out the other. Shouting at each other in this place does not cancel out the pain either but it does inflame and is dangerous, and we have to get back to reason.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a political conversation—or it should not be. And for no-one in this place should it be about votes. To be clear: me standing here saying this, given the community that I represent, reflects zero political advantage. But I must say this: I would strongly argue that just as the Australian government exerts pressure on Hamas for Israeli hostages to be released in this terrible war, the same pressure must be brought on the Netanyahu government to end its offensive. It is self-evident that the fundamental rule to protect civilians is not being followed; this is undeniable. In seeking to dismantle Hamas in response to 7 October, the government of Israel must not risk dismantling its standing in the world. The only reasonable course of action is ceasefire and negotiations for immediate and sustained peace. The challenge, given the historic intractability of this conflict, is to focus on the now. Any conversation about this must be underpinned with the understanding that conflict between these two parties is longstanding. Many have come before us attempting to solve it and have failed. Protests are understandable, but they won't fix it—nor will hurling abuse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent months we've seen inflammatory motions designed to wedge for political reasons rather than to promote a reasoned debate. But I ask today: if not peace negotiations in line with this motion, then what? Really, what? Worsening war? A widening regional conflict? World War III? I will not sit here and not speak up, only to have to send Australia's sons and daughters—my own 17-year-old son, perhaps—to war next year or the year after. I will not sit without speaking, because that is the serious precipice on which we stand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I strongly support Palestinian statehood under the auspices of a peace process leading to a two-state solution. In that, this moment is an opportunity for the Palestinian Authority, for example, to step up and show that it can reinvent itself to lead. To be clear, my concern is also for Israel and its people. A safe and secure future of the Israelis and the Palestinians is intertwined. Israel will not be truly safe until Palestine is also free. If only we could all have that clear-headed conversation about how we get there, rather than hurling abuse at each other inside and outside this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stand here today, I sense a pivotal moment in our history as a nation and as a world. Such times are deserving of reasoned, careful words and actions. Life and death must not be weaponised for political gain within the people's House or outside it. I support reason. I offer what I've just said with empathy to those in my own community who are struggling with deep anxiety and fear. But I have my eyes fixed on the future—that is, peace for two groups of people. This must be the aspiration of us all. A two-state solution is the only way through. I support this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  As a long-term activist and supporter of the Palestinian people, I rise to speak in support of this important motion. It's so important that it fills me with emotion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion calls for the need to recognise the state of Palestine. It does so crucially as part of an enduring peace process and a two-state solution. This motion cannot be more urgent, and the context of peace and the two-state solution couldn't be more important. The death and destruction in Gaza must end. I know my electorate and the broader community are desperate for that to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am under no illusion that this motion will do that. It can't. But it illustrates what this Labor government has held as its position on Palestine for many years. It reflects our party platform. It puts a line in the sand, once and for all, putting to rest untruths, misrepresentation and, quite frankly, lies bandied about by many in this House. This is a motion that looks towards the future—a different future. It's a motion that reflects a credible and genuine path to ending this conflict, one that seeks to secure a lasting and enduring peace for Palestinian people and all people in the region of the Middle East. What we are witnessing in Gaza right now is horrific. The widespread human suffering is completely unacceptable. The Albanese Labor government has been clear: this cannot continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the past nine months, we've seen destruction, terror, killing and murder, and we absolutely grieve every single death, Palestinian and Israeli. This government, the Albanese Labor government, has been clear: the suffering must end. The Netanyahu government must stop its assault on Rafah. The flow of aid must be facilitated. A ceasefire must be negotiated. It's incumbent on us to ensure what we say in this House is not a risk to any of that happening, which is why we put this motion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Gellibrand, the assistant minister, outlined so eloquently the hard work happening by this government. We are working towards peace. That is what governments do. But history has shown us that, if this war, this assault, were to end today, the peace may well be short lived. We've seen it before. In 2021, 2014, 2012, 2008, 2005, 2001, 1987—the list goes on and on. And it does so in this House, in this chamber, by a party of government that says we have to see an enduring peace, and that is why this motion is important. As a government, we have a responsibility to ensure whatever we do does not, in any way, have a negative impact on the complex situation in the Middle East. We need to be thoughtful and careful but also compassionate and caring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, the hostages must be released, and we condemn what happened—the attacks by Hamas on October 7. I cannot imagine what people living in this complex and unstable region have endured over the decades with this ongoing relentless and persistent threat of conflict. Children have spent their childhoods, people their whole lives, with regular conflict, losing members of their family, their livelihoods, their homelands, in decades of suffering. Three generations of Palestinians now live in refugee camps in Lebanon. The recent fighting has left innocent people dead and the Palestinian people displaced and disempowered—fighting that has left them not only homeless but stateless. It was the Nakba that uprooted millions of Palestinians from their homes, communities and lives, and there has been a cycle of violence and an inability to find meaningful, peaceful solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as we face this present moment, this war in Gaza, we recognise the historical context and the need to take real action, thoughtful action, to create a better future, one that crucially includes a Palestinian state lying in peace beside a state of Israel, with genuine, meaningful peace across the region. The Labor Party believes that the suffering, the fighting and the displacement has gone on too long. We don't just scream and shout about this; we are a party of government. We want to get this done. We know that simply moving motions in the House or in the Senate, shouting in press conferences or singling out your political opponents won't do anything for the Palestinian people. The Australian government recognises a two-state solution, and we are working towards it.</span>

It is fair to say that that was a long-lasting—in fact, life-changing—experience for me. I stand here as the member for Fisher. I estimate that I would have probably no more than 100 Jewish people in my electorate. If you look at this purely from a political perspective, I've no skin in the game. But this is not something which we should be looking at as a political, skin-in-the-game issue. There's a what's right and there's a what's wrong.</span>

Why is no-one ever talking about how Hamas should surrender and return the hostages? Why doesn't this motion talk about a surrender of Hamas and talk about the return of the around 120 hostages that are still being held by Hamas today, eight months later? Can you imagine living in a tunnel and being held captive for eight months away from your friends and your family? They don't know whether you're alive.</span>

Why are we not talking about that? Why are we not talking about the suffering of the tens of thousands of Israelis that have also been displaced along the northern borders? The media never talk about that. There are tens of thousands of Israelis displaced who are living in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem because it's not safe for them to live in border areas because of the rocket attacks from Gaza, from the West Bank and from Lebanon. It's as though the media don't want to talk about those things, yet tens of thousands of Israelis are suffering that displacement.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  I first of all want to say that the member for Chifley was down to speak, and he's given me his speaking spot. I really appreciate it. I really appreciate his generosity in this moment. I don't think it's worth dismissing that a Muslim member of this place gave his speaking spot to a Jewish member of this place so that I could contribute to this debate. I want to thank my friend for his generosity in this moment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I dream of peace. I dream of peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. It has been something that has haunted my family for generations. We have seen year after year and war after war completely destroy and damage people and communities, and for what? We still in 2024 are facing an intractable conflict between two peoples, most of whom just want to live in peace and in dignity. And we see that here in Australia. I know that most people here in our wonderful country just want to see more peaceful days ahead. In this country, our hearts break.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Something that we all can hold onto is a shared humanity that we must all uphold. It is okay to look at the violence that is facing the Palestinian people and feel a deep sense of loss and sadness, and to want that to end today. And it is okay to see the absolutely devastating scenes that we saw on October 7, a day that saw the largest loss of Jewish life on any day since the Holocaust. My heart breaks for both, and I say that as a Jewish Australian who desperately wants to see this war come to an end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many intractable parts of this conflict. I have a degree in this conflict and I still don't quite know how to fix it. I know that there are players who are desperate to end the peace process and to try and disturb any efforts towards peace. I know that trees take years and years and years to grow and can be cut down in a second, and that is what the Middle East has demonstrated over and over again. We have seen people try to grow a tree, to try and build this sense of togetherness and unity between two peoples yet time and time again it has been cut down in an instant of violence, and it has been cut down by politics where you either have players like Hamas or players that have taken over the far right of Israeli politics that are desperate to demonise the other people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is sad because it means that in this place we see a conflict continuing in 2024. I desperately want to see an end to the violence. I desperately want to see the people of Gaza being able to rebuild their lives in dignity and in peace, to move freely, to have freedom of speech and to have a future for their children. What human doesn't want that for another human? I desperately want to see my family and friends in Israel live within safe and secure borders, not worried about who might interrupt them in their own home. I don't think that's too high a bar to set. I don't think that we in Australia can dream of anything more than peace between the two peoples.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion before the House is the bare minimum. It says that we support the recognition of a Palestinian state as part of a peace process. That peace process is something that I hold onto and have held onto my entire life. That peace process says that we are all people, above all, and that there has to be a way through this. There has to be a way through this conflict. I wish that we could pull a lever here in Australia and it would all end today, but we have seen time and time again that that is not the case. What we can also control is how we engage, like the member for Chifley just did, where he didn’t seek to enforce his views but actually gave the opportunity for someone else to speak. In this moment, it's me, and I really appreciate it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to see people in Australia looking and having conversations, not just sitting on their phones and reinforcing their own views. Reach across and have a discussion with someone who may not agree with you, because this conflict is not a licence to divide our community. This conflict is about people. It is about two peoples who deserve to live in dignity and peace, because that is what we want in the region. That is what we want for the people of Israel, and that is what we want for the Palestinian people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finish where I started. I dream of peace. I dream of peace between two peoples, and I hope desperately to see it one day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  Some 146 countries have already recognised the state of Palestine but this Labor government refuses. How is it fair that this government recognises Israel but refuses to immediately recognise Palestine? These are weasel words from this government—crocodile tears—while right now we know there have been 37,000 Palestinians murdered by Israel—37,000! What does this government do? It has not taken a single action against Israel to pressure it to stop the genocide in Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the genocide convention—to which Australia is a signatory—this Labor government have a responsibility to take actions to punish genocide. They could end the two-way arms trade with Israel this government are carrying out but they refuse. They could cancel the Elbit Systems contract—that is, the Israeli weapons company blacklisted by countries in Europe for carrying out war crimes. Under this government, a $917 million contract was signed with Elbit Systems. This government could cancel that contract but it refuses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government could follow the Netherlands and ban the export of F-35 parts because they could go into Israeli jets that carry out war crimes. The F-35 parts that go into Israeli jets are currently screeching over the heads of Palestinian men, women and children. It could sanction Israel. Why is it this government could sanction Russia for the war crimes carried out by Russia but refuse to sanction Israel? They could expel the Israeli ambassador. Let's be very clear about this. If the government were true to their word and cared about the Palestinian people they would take actions against Israel to stop the genocide and the invasion. That is what they would do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be very, very clear about this. Every time Israel carries out a massacre, every time Israel kills Palestinian men, women and children, and they look around the world and don't receive a single sanction to stop, they are emboldened and they keep acting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of a peace process, this motion is a joke. What peace process? Israel is carrying out a genocide in Gaza. It is not a peace process. Why is it 146 countries could find it in their hearts to recognise Palestine right now? Why is it the Australian government refuses? And how is it that when a Labor senator, Senator Payman, who had the principles and the courage to cross the floor to vote with the Greens to immediately recognise Palestine, faces more sanctions than Labor has dished out against Israel? That is remarkable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think what today is about is that Senator Payman has demonstrated the political cowardice in this place from Labor members. How is it that Senator Payman had the courage to cross the floor and vote to immediately recognise Palestine but no member of Labor in this place has the guts to do that? That is what people will remember in 10 or 20 years time when asked the question: what did members in this place do when Israel was carrying out a massacre in Gaza?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear about this. The UN has found that Israel is carrying out war crimes. The UN has put Israel on a blacklist of countries that kill children—in this case, Palestinian children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government all of a sudden apparently care. They are not doing anything about politics and say this is above politics. If it was above politics they would take material action right now to put pressure on Israel to stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about some facts. These are things that Israel has done to Palestine and Gaza. Ask yourselves, as Labor members in this place, why is it that our government has taken no actions to pressure Israel to stop?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a million Palestinians at risk of death by starvation by the end of July. There is a critical lack of milk and baby formula and nutritional supplements for children and for pregnant and breastfeeding women. And what did this government do? For 48 days they paused funding to UNRWA, which was providing aid to Palestine. It is remarkable that this government have taken more actions against a Labor senator who voted to immediately recognise Palestine. They have taken more actions against Palestinians by temporarily pausing Palestinian visas and by pausing aid funding to Palestine when Israel has been known to carry out an engineered famine in Gaza, killing tens of thousands of Palestinians with bombs and famine. There are currently Palestinian children right now dying in their parents' arms, losing the energy to breathe because they have run out of food to eat. And what do you all do? What do this Labor government do? They can recognise Israel but they can't immediately recognise Palestine. You can't end the two-way arms trade. You can't cancel the Elbit Systems contract. You can't sanction Israel. You should all be deeply ashamed. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  I think everyone in this House feels desperately sad about what is happening in the Middle East. It is truly tragic, the horrific attack of October 7 is unspeakable and will remain in the Jewish community and around the world the greatest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust. At the same time, every single one of us and I think everyone in our country feels the pain of watching the Palestinian people in Gaza—the women, children and families—who have been absolutely devastated by this war. It is an absolute tragedy. Like many people in this room, I hope, I have always supported a two-state solution. Like the member for Macnamara, I have always dreamt, to be honest, of a situation where the Palestinian people and the Israeli people, the Jewish people, live side by side in self-determination and in separate states. That is what I seek now and what I will continue to seek.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what I am concerned about in this motion and in every motion that we have had on this issue in the House is that we are not actually achieving anything in terms of the difference it will make to the people in the conflict right now, when we all desperately want the UN Security Council's peace resolution endorsed, to come off, and for those parties to come to that agreement. That is what I am seeking right now; that's what I care about, and I'm concerned this motion does nothing to that. All it does is tear our community even further apart. I share the member for Fisher's view that I wish we had found a motion that could unite the parliament more, because it does no good to our country to have motions where the majority of the parliament is sitting on either side on something which is tearing our community apart. It is tearing my community apart. They feel very, very strongly and are desperately concerned. I am concerned that this just inflames tension without adding anything to what we are really all seeking, which is actually a long and standing peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak for my community, who are desperately saddened and appalled by what has happened overseas but are also extremely concerned about what is happening here. Once again, I just worry that we continue to inflame this in this place. We do not unite or move forward, and I do not support what the Greens have been saying at all throughout this time, but I think there was an opportunity for the rest of the parliament to unite on something that was appropriate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  I rise with a heavy heart, but I want to pay tribute to the member for Macnamara and also the member for Chifley. That was one of the most powerful moments I've had in my two years in this place. It actually summed up this situation at a global level. This is not about Jewish people and people of Islamic faith. It is a much more complicated issue than that. The passion that the member for Macnamara spoke with and the journey he has gone through as an individual—the unfair attacks on him are a disgrace. I want to pay tribute to him for that contribution. I also acknowledge the member for Cowan. It's clear that this is a complicated, challenging issue that has so many layers and affects so many people. In that moment, we saw a powerful demonstration of what this place can see.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, straight after that moment, we saw one of the most disgraceful things I've seen in this House. The member for Griffith had a choice in that moment, after that powerful speech from the member for Macnamara, to reach into his humanity and realise that this is not about politics; this is about the challenges that people are going through in the Middle East. It is about the challenges that people are going through here in Australia. It is about members of parliament and their staff having their offices vandalised and destroyed, and that is being stoked by those in the Greens. He had a choice. He could have spoken with humanity and recognised the amazing moment that we saw. But he went straight to politics, and he will have to reflect on that. This is not an easy, black-and-white situation. It is complex, it is challenging—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, the reason that standing orders must be suspended to allow this motion to be dealt with immediately is as a consequence of the motion that was just moved by the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, because it is very important to establish the appropriate conditions that would need to be met before the state of Palestine should be recognised. Now, you may ask why the opposition feels it's necessary to move this now rather than, as an alternative, engaging with the government in a constructive way in relation to a motion that it proposes to move and nominating the conditions that we consider would be necessary before the motion could be supported. If you were to ask that, I would certainly agree that that would have been a sensible process to engage in and the opposition would certainly have been ready to engage in such a negotiation and discussion process on the merits. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, and for reasons which it must be said are, frankly, mystifying, the government did not attempt to engage in any way with the opposition in relation to the terms of the motion that the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs came into this place to move. There was no attempt to engage in advance on the terms of that motion and no attempt to arrive at what would have been a highly desirable state of affairs, where there was agreement reached across as many members of this parliament as possible on a matter which is undoubtedly one that is provoking great anxiety within the Australian community and which has been the source of much contention and ill feeling. It is a great shame that the government did not seek in any way to engage with the opposition on this matter and seek to arrive at a position which could have been mutually supported, and such an outcome would have been highly desirable in terms of maintaining social harmony and cohesion in our nation, which, of course, is one of the world's most successful multicultural, multiracial, multi-ethnic, multireligious nations. That success is something in which we can all take pride, but it is a success that is not achieved without being continually worked at—worked at, it must be said, by both major parties of government. It is, I think, quite regrettable that the government has conducted itself in the way that it has in relation to the motion that has been moved. It has missed an opportunity to arrive at an aligned position. I can't be confident that an aligned position could have, ultimately, been reached. I can't be confident of that, but I do know that if the government makes zero attempt on a matter of such sensitivity and such importance to engage with the opposition in relation to whether an aligned position can be arrived at then that is no way to be conducting itself at a time when these issues are of enormous sensitivity within our community. I think this has been a deeply regrettable missed opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition believes it is very important that this House should have the opportunity to state very clearly what we believe needs to be satisfied in terms of preconditions in advance of any recognition of a Palestinian state occurring. We believe that's important, from first principles, and if I can reference the eloquent remarks from the member for Berowra earlier today, we believe that becomes only more important given the reality that this position, which the government is proposing will be taken by Australia internationally, is a position being taken after the appalling terrorist attacks of October 7, which saw some 1,200 innocent men, women and children killed, and some 200 people dragged away as hostages, some of whom, sadly, subsequently have died and others of whom remain imprisoned in the tunnels under the Gaza Strip. It is impossible to be discussing this issue without a recognition of the events which have preceded it. It is, therefore, deeply regrettable that the government made no attempt to engage with the opposition in relation to the basis on which a motion of this nature could—at least potentially—have obtained the support of both of the major parties of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I direct the House to the terms of the procedural motion which the government moved, establishing the terms under which the debate on the motion moved by the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs was held, because those terms did not admit of amendments. They did not allow for a process in which this House could have worked towards a form of a motion which—again, at least potentially, as I cannot say with certainty—had the scope for receiving the support of both major parties of government. I won't speak for anybody else in this parliament, but it is clear that the way the government conducted itself from the outset was evidently done in a way that showed no appetite for reaching agreement between the two major parties of government on this matter—which is, of course, enormously important when it comes to the position that Australia as a nation takes in international forums. It's also enormously important in terms of the leadership which this parliament is able to demonstrate to the broader community at a time when we have seen troubling instances of social disharmony arising out of different perspectives as to what is occurring in the Middle East. It is a time when we have seen—as this parliament has rightly condemned—the appalling spectacle of war memorials being vandalised, showing remarkable, extraordinary disrespect to all of those who have served and sacrificed for our nation over more than 100 years. It's at a time when we have seen events occurring on university campuses which mean, sadly, that Jewish students have indicated that they do not feel safe, and other students have expressed concern that their lectures have been interrupted by political activists seeking to press them to take a particular position on the events in the Middle East. We of course saw the extremely troubling events on the forecourt of the Opera House only a few short days after the 7 October terrorist attack, when we saw people saying terrible things about the Jewish people. We saw a real sense of breakdown in public order and troubling instances of Jewish Australians being advised by the police not to be out in public.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  I second the motion. In fact, I think there has probably not been a more important suspension of standing orders motion that I have spoken on than this one. It is so important that we immediately correct what has gone on in the House with the previous motion. What we have now is a very untidy circumstance, where we have one motion that has been passed in this House that recognises a Palestinian state without conditions, and we have another motion that was passed in the Senate which reflects the work of my friend the Manager of Opposition Business in adding these amendments. I would jealously defend the rights of this House, but we need to think about who is putting this motion together in the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Government in the Senate is the foreign minister. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate is the shadow foreign minister. Together, they worked on this motion and put together a series of conditions which reflect, more or less, a traditional Australian foreign policy position on Israel-Palestine. Without these conditions we're seeing what I spoke about in the previous debate, which is a growing gulf between the government and the opposition in relation to Israel and in relation to the Jewish community. As a Jewish Australian I decry that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to see a bipartisan position in relation to Israel and Palestine. The position that we on this side of the House have held on these issues has reflected the longstanding tradition of bipartisanship on these issues. Fundamentally, that is that you can't have a Palestinian state without Palestinians recognising Israel's right to exist, and that is the first condition that's in this motion put forward by my friend the Manager of Opposition Business. This motion clarifies that there should be no role for Hamas in a future Palestinian state. This motion also acknowledges the realities on the ground; people might like the idea of a Palestinian state, but we have a Palestinian authority in the West Bank that has not had an election for decades. And we know that if an election were held there, Hamas would win that election, so we would have the same issues there. The basic conditions of a stable state are not able to be met, and that's why it's important that we have points in the amendment that relate to the reform of the Palestinian Authority being achieved, including major security and governance reforms. It's important that we have agreed processes to resolve final status issues, including state borders and rights of return; these should be spelled out as a clear condition of Australian foreign policy. And there should be appropriate security guarantees between parties to ensure peace and security between recognised borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This very same motion, the motion put forward by my friend the Manager of Opposition Business, was put forward only last Tuesday in the Senate. It beggars belief that the foreign minister's own assistant minister didn't come to the House, if they wanted to move this motion, and have as the starting point the same motion that was handed out in the Senate. This speaks to me of a motion that was dreamed up on the back of an envelope five minutes before the assistant minister came into the House. I think on an issue of such sensitivity, that is a great shame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that the tensions in the community at this point on these issues are completely unprecedented. The antisemitism that I have seen and, indeed, the failure of people in authority to do anything about antisemitism have created a massive sense of abandonment among Jewish Australians. I have to say that I have been very disappointed this government hasn't taken up the offer of a judicial inquiry into antisemitism on campuses. There's also no evidence that this government has provided any directions to the Australian Federal Police to take a tougher line on antisemitism. There was lots of talk about doxxing laws as a result of the doxxing of Jewish artists and creatives. We've seen nothing on that. There has been lots of talk from this government about an envoy on antisemitism. Again, months have passed, and we've seen nothing. There's been talk about strengthening laws, and, again and again, we've seen nothing. We just get motions and empty words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the motion that was just passed, without these clear conditions, undermines social cohesion in this country. It undermines an attempt to get bipartisanship on this issue, and that's why I say to those opposite that it is actually worthwhile thinking about supporting this motion—if nothing else, to bring the House into line with the Senate, the place where the two principal spokespeople for foreign policy for the government and the opposition sat and hammered out these words only a week ago.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—I am pleased to make a statement on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' report <span style="font-style:italic;">Report 217</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">U</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-U</span><span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">space launches</span>. The report focuses on JSCOT's inquiry into a new major treaty action, the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the United States of America on technology safeguards associated with the United States's participation in space launches from Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is an active contributor to space activities, and, through the Australian Space Agency, we continue to remain engaged on the matter of space regulation. Australia is committed to safe and secure space operations with the aim of transforming and growing a globally respected Australian space sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of the agreement is to provide a legal and technical framework to protect US launch vehicles, spacecraft, related equipment and technical data. This will better enable US companies, government organisations and universities to undertake commercial space launch activities in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is an attractive partner for space collaboration and space flight because of our geography; our ability to access different orbits that are not available in other parts of the world; our wide open ranges; and, of course, our stability, effective regulatory framework and skilled workforce. The committee received evidence that, by collaborating with a global space heavyweight, like the US, Australia will be able to increase our space launch capacity and capability and open new partnerships with other like-minded nations, which, in-turn, will expand our space sector across the board. The value of the global space sector is expected to rise to US$1.1 trillion by 2040, and the reduction in space launch payload costs will mean that Australia is well positioned to be involved in collaborative space industry endeavours. It was the committee's view that ratification of the agreement will assist not only the development of our space sector but also the Australian economy more broadly through related manufacturing and service business activity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given all these benefits and opportunities, and considering a range of related factors, the committee believes that ratification of the Australia-US Space Launches Agreement is in Australia's national interest. JSCOT conducted its inquiry into the agreement through a public hearing during which officials from the Australian Space Agency, the Australian Trade and Investment Commission and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade participated. Other key stakeholders from the space industry, law and governance sectors also gave evidence, as you can imagine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry did cover key issues, like expanding the scope of our bilateral relationship with the US, regional engagement, economic benefits, capacity building for Australia's space industry and the significance of the US in the space sector. More specific issues relating to the agreement were also canvassed by committee members, like the need for a collaborative approach between industry and government alongside the appropriate safeguards and protections, management of relevant reviews and reporting under the auspices of the agreement, the use of segregated areas within Australia to conduct space activities covered by the agreement and related intellectual property rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 'controlled and segregated areas' part of the agreement will be a matter of interest to some in the community. It means that US space launches in Australia have access to areas that will be highly restricted, in the main. That, understandably, raises questions of sovereign control, appropriate land management with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and whether such restricted access could, in practice, provide benefits to the Australian space industry. The committee was provided with evidence that the tight control of these areas is critical to provide assurances that US technology will be protected, but through the agreement Australian authorities retain—and this is important—facilitated access to segregated areas to conduct all of the usual official duties and functions, particularly in exigent circumstances such as fire, police or health emergencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that basis and for all those reasons, the committee supports the Australia-US space launches agreement and has recommended that binding treaty action be taken. I thank the deputy chair and other committee members for their work, and, of course, the secretariat for the way they support what we do through this important process. On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281826" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:35</span>):  by leave—I rise to commend this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to the House. The agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the United States of America on the technology safeguards associated with the United States participation in space launches from Australia was signed in the USA on 26 October last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The global space industry is growing rapidly and is predicted to more than double in value over the next 20 years, so it makes sense that if our close ally the US is keen to partner with Australia for launches, we should absolutely do all we can to encourage that. That's what this treaty is about. It's about ensuring sensitive US technology is protected. Not only will it protect US interests, but it will help build the Australian space industry, creating new jobs and providing opportunities for companies. We have previously ratified all five space treaties, and we have multiple other treaties with the US already.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important in all this that our own national interests are upheld, and the committee is satisfied that they are. However, the opposition is keen to see the Australian space industry does receive a tangible benefit from partnerships like this. During hearings, we heard evidence that regulatory barriers could hinder the development of Australia's space industry. The government must ensure that it prioritises Australian industry. We do not want to see a situation where Australian companies are facing higher regulatory barriers than international companies. We must ensure there is a balance between facilitating international participation and fostering a strong domestic industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'd also like to see a clear strategy in the government to foster an Australian space capability with government programs to help local companies establish their credibility and capability rather than just relying on the market forces to develop the sector. So, while it's not directly related to the treaty, we encourage the government to do more to facilitate domestic growth in this sector in a timely manner while maintaining appropriate safeguards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank all those involved in the public hearing—those who provided submissions, the chair, the rest of the committee and the secretariat, who have been back and forth since 4.30 this afternoon to hear this. Thank you. You do an amazing job, and we thank you for your support. I commend this treaty report to the House.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—Australia's a wealthy country that has enjoyed a gradual and persistent increase in life expectancy for many generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, however, we face a series of challenges presented by a rising tide of chronic illnesses. Foremost amongst these is diabetes mellitus. With the aim of identifying strategies that we as a nation might pursue to combat this disease, just over a year ago the House Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport commenced an inquiry into diabetes mellitus in Australia in all its forms, and I thank the health minister for allowing us to do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the country, approximately 1½ million people are known to live with diabetes. Even worse, there is overwhelming evidence that this number will continue to rise. The nation faces what was throughout the inquiry described as a diabetes epidemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In undertaking this inquiry, the committee focused on opportunities for strengthening our approach to preventing, diagnosing and treating all forms of diabetes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence gathered by the committee makes it clear that diabetes does not impact all Australians equally. Members of communities with lower socioeconomic status are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes for a whole range of factors, and we must try and turn this ship around.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Current rates of type 2 diabetes are especially alarming amongst Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander communities. Not only do these communities experience high levels of diabetes; the disease often develops at a younger age and its course is more rapid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having completed its inquiry, the committee formed the view that prevention should be the primary aim of diabetes management wherever possible. Public health campaigns that raise awareness of the risk of diabetes in obesity should be prioritised, and we should strive to develop a healthcare workforce that has deep expertise in the prevention and management of these conditions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also address the fact that the environments we live in promote unhealthy habits. We need to restrict the availability and marketing of unhealthy food and beverages, especially to children. More also needs to be done to ensure that all Australian communities have access to healthy food.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As such, while prevention is good at tackling the diabetes epidemic, the cultivation of a sophisticated research ecosystem and deep national expertise in the medications and technologies that can assist in the treatment of diabetes are just as important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 23 main recommendations in the report, and there are other recommendations in the body of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to thank the federal and state government departments and agencies, industry groups, peak bodies, think tanks, academics, health practitioners, medical research organisations, pharmaceutical and health companies, and members of the general public who all provided invaluable input into this inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, I'd like to thank those with lived experience of diabetes in all its forms for their evidence to the committee. Some of their evidence was deeply harrowing and very emotional, and we're very grateful for the efforts they have made. In conducting the inquiry, the committee travelled throughout Australia to hear firsthand experience, and it was very important.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their dedication and commitment to the committee are fine reflections on the Australian Public Service, of the highest standard, and I cannot thank them enough for all their efforts.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank also my fellow committee members for their participation, as all members contributed very strongly through the committee report.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd particularly like to thank the deputy chairs, Melissa McIntosh and later Julian Leeser, for their hard work, their spirit of cooperation, their intelligence during the inquiry and their willingness and empathy to work with all members of the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank my friends and colleagues David Simmons and Helen Woodward for always allowing me to call at any hour to question them and get their sage advice about critical issues in diabetes management.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  by leave—Over the past year the committee had almost 500 written submissions and conducted 15 public hearings across Australia, hearing from advocacy groups, international renowned health experts and many people who live with diabetes every day. To those who shared their stories with us, I say thank you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even before becoming a member of this committee, I knew something of the experience of people living with diabetes and their families. In my electorate, there's an active group of children and families living with type 1 diabetes who support the JDRF who've come to see me, and I've watched the progress of a number of those children, and many of their families have become friends. Because of my constituents, I've been an advocate for research into diabetes and, in particular, greater access to CGMs. And I want to put on record my thanks to Greg Hunt, the health minister in the Morrison government, for extending access and supporting research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I would like to acknowledge and thank the chair of the committee, the member for Macarthur, Dr Mike Freelander. It's been an absolute pleasure to work with him. The professionalism of the member for Macarthur in conducting the inquiry, his deep passion on the issue of diabetes, his expertise developed over many decades as a paediatrician and his collegiate approach are very much appreciated by all members of the committee, particularly on our side of the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to mention the former deputy chair of the committee, the member for Lindsay. The member for Lindsay was the deputy chair for most of this inquiry and contributed much. She's the mother of Byron, who I understand is in the parliament today, and he lives with type 1 diabetes. She brought the perspective of a parent dealing with type 1 diabetes to the inquiry, and I'm grateful to her for all of her assistance, including in the final stages of the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With one exception, the recommendations of the final report into diabetes enjoy bipartisan support. For instance, the report contains recommendations about the need for greater analysis; increased screening; the development of a best practice framework to tackle obesogenic environments in coordination with state and territory governments; and broader public awareness and promotion of healthy lifestyle choices. These are steps that would build on the work of many previous governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All members of the committee were struck by evidence that most Australians are not meeting their required levels of physical activity and of the need to encourage participation in sport throughout the school years to develop a foundation for lifelong healthy living. We agree with the recommendations about better and simpler food labelling to make consumer choices of healthy food easier. Coalition members of the committee agreed with recommendations to expand subsidies for access to CGMs. The CGM scheme was established in 2017 by the coalition and, once established, further enhancements and investments were made to the scheme. And we agree that equitable access to health care for people living with all forms of diabetes is crucial to effective management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the course of the inquiry, the committee evidence heard from groups in regional, rural and remote communities about the difficulties they face in managing diabetes. A person's ability to manage diabetes should not be determined by postcode. Coalition members of the committee also agreed with the need to investigate mechanisms for priority access to GLP1 receptor agonists for disadvantaged and remote communities of high need, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. We strongly support a review into the limits for accessing juvenile mental health and diabetes services, with a view to enabling young people to continue receiving support for longer. Coalition members agreed with the need to investigate measures to lower the cost of treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, while there are many areas of agreement, coalition members dissent from recommendation 4, which recommends a sugar tax. We believe that the case for a levy on sugar-sweetened beverages has not been made. Australia is in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis which shows no sign of abating. People are doing it tough, struggling to pay bills and put food on the table. We believe this new tax proposal would cause financial harm disproportionately to those who can least afford it. There's also a real issue about whether a sugar tax would change behaviour. Finally, it's worth noting that an existing tax is applied to discretionary foods, such as confectionary and sugary drinks, and that's by way of the goods and services tax. But the GST does not apply to a range of healthy foods like fresh fruit, vegetables, fish and bottled water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, with the exception of this recommendation, coalition members support all other recommendations in the report, and we encourage the government to give those recommendations serious consideration and implementation. Once again, I thank the chair, my parliamentary colleagues and the committee staff for their efforts in the inquiry. I hope those living with diabetes recognise the genuine goodwill and deep thinking about diabetes management and prevention that have gone into the report. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FERNANDO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024. Australia has one of the best higher education systems in the world. International education is a vital part of supporting the system and spreading innovation. International education is one of Australia's largest exports, adding $48 billion to the economy. This is only outstripped by our exports in coal, iron and gas. It serves as a crucial pillar of our economy and society, offering huge benefits, not only in economic terms but also in the cultural and social dimensions. It's important from a geopolitical perspective and it makes us friends all over the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">International education is more than just a significant economic driver; it is also our largest source of permanent migration. Students who come to Australia for their degrees and who learn about our culture and do internships in our companies often choose to stay. They seek work and contribute to our nation afterwards. Their presence enriches our communities and enhances our global connections, fostering a multicultural environment that benefits all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the high value of international students to our economy and society, it is paramount that we protect them from exploitation. Unfortunately, international students are often targeted by unscrupulous education agents and fraudulent institutions who sell education as a way to get work rights in Australia or who do not deliver on the programs they promised. These bad actors tarnish our reputation and undermine the integrity of our education system. Through the work of the National Union of Students, the Council of International Students Australia and other advocates, we know about these issues, and to address them we are now introducing the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a significant step in ensuring the continued excellence and integrity of Australia's international education sector. The Education Services for Overseas Students Act—or ESOS—first introduced in 2000, has already opened the doors for more than four million students to study at our higher education institutions. It provides the regulatory framework for the sector, outlining the responsibilities of institutions and agents, ensuring that Australian education maintains its world-class reputation. We are now strengthening the government's power under this act to ensure students are not exploited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education agents, often operating overseas, are tasked with promoting Australian education and assisting students in applying for our programs. However, with minimal oversight and a commission based payment model, these agents are often rife with abuse. To tackle these issues we are implementing several new measures to prevent collusion between universities and education agents. Both these entities profit from enrolling more students, creating a potential conflict of interest that can lead to dishonest practices. We are introducing new registration requirements for education agents to ensure only those with a proven commitment to ethical practices can operate. This includes strengthening the 'fit and proper' requirement, increasing scrutiny of cross-ownership between education agents and providers to prevent deceitful behaviours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year we closed the concurrent enrolment loophole which allowed agents and providers to shift international students to cheaper, less rigorous courses within six months of their arrival. This was in response to the rise of ghost colleges where students would shift enrolment to keep work rights and not have any intention of studying. In this bill, we are prohibiting agents accepting commissions for transferring students between institutions once they are in Australia. This practice often leads to students being shifted from their original courses to cheaper, less-rigorous courses, purely for financial gain. These ghost colleges, often hidden within offices in the CBD, claim to offer education to thousands of international students. However, investigators revealed that many of these classrooms remained empty, with students nowhere to be found. These colleges exist to exploit loopholes to profit from students who are mainly seeking work opportunities, rather than genuine education. By banning commissions we are removing one of the incentives for agents to transfer students to these colleges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Transparency and accountability are crucial to maintaining the high standards of our education system. By fostering an environment where information is openly shared and accessible, we can uphold the integrity that makes Australian education globally respected. The bill requires providers—on request—to report education agent commissions. This measure aims to eliminate any hidden incentives that might encourage dodgy behaviour, thereby protecting students from being exploited by agents who prioritise profit over education. Furthermore, this bill empowers regulators to share performance data about education agents with providers. This provision is pivotal in creating a system where education providers can access comprehensive data about the agents they are working with. By having detailed insight into the performance and practices of education agents, providers can make better informed decisions about their partnerships. These measures collectively ensure that all stakeholders in the education sector adhere to the highest standards of integrity and quality. By embedding transparency and accountability into the system, we safeguard the interests of students, uphold the reputation of our education providers and reinforce Australia's standing as a leader in international education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Post COVID, around the world, there has been a rebound in international students. In 2019, prior to the pandemic, 636,000 students chose to study in Australia, and today that number is 740,000, with a 21 per cent increase on March from last year. It also means that over one-quarter of all students at Australian universities are from overseas, with up to 80 per cent in some courses. To ensure the sector grows in a sustainable manner, we are placing limits on international student enrolments. These limits will help manage the growth of the sector, ensuring that it does not expand beyond our capacity to maintain high standards of education and student welfare. The bill grants the Minister for Education new powers to manage enrolments effectively, providing a structured approach to controlling the flow of international students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's high wages relative to the cost of living have traditionally been a significant drawback for international students. The prospect of earning a competitive salary while enjoying a relatively affordable lifestyle has been a compelling factor in choosing Australia as a study destination. However, the housing crisis is increasingly undermining this attraction. Rising property prices and rental costs, particularly in major cities, have created significant challenges for students in finding affordable and safe accommodation. At the moment, universities have no requirement to consider international students' housing needs. They can enrol them, bring them onshore and take their fees with no duty of care regarding their living conditions. This lack of responsibility has heightened the housing issues faced by these students, leaving many in vulnerable situations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current housing affordability crisis has resulted in a distressing reality for some international students who are forced to reside in unsafe and overcrowded accommodations. Desperate to find affordable options, students often find themselves living in substandard conditions with multiple individuals crammed into a single bedroom. This situation not only compromises their safety, privacy and overall wellbeing but also hampers their ability to focus on their studies and enjoy a positive student experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to these challenges, the minister will be able to set enrolment limits based on a range of factors, including considering Australia's skills needs and the availability of student accommodation. Universities will be able to increase these limits by building more student accommodations. These limits will be implemented following consultations with the sector and will come into effect from 2025. By carefully regulating the number of international students, we can ensure that we do not overwhelm our housing market or educational institutions, thereby protecting the quality of education and the overall student experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also allow the minister to limit or cancel courses enrolling international students that have persistent quality issues or provide limited value to Australia's skills needs. By doing so, we can better allocate our resources to support areas that are crucial to our country's growth and sustainability. This builds on our government's previous work in strengthening the quality and integrity of our higher education system. In October, we boosted the capacity of the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator by establishing an integrity unit to oversee the sector and ensure compliance with high standards. In March, we increased the English-language requirement for international students, ensuring they have the skills needed to succeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also introduced a new genuine student requirement to ensure students' true intention to come to Australia is to study, while recognising that they may want to stay and contribute to our nation after their degree. We also increased the number of no-further-stay conditions to prevent visa overstays. These measures, combined with the new enrolment limits and enhanced transparency provisions, ensure the growth of our international education sector while maintaining Australia's reputation as a global leader in education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024 is a crucial step in safeguarding the integrity and quality of Australia's international education sector. It addresses the challenges posed by dodgy education agents, who have exploited students for far too long, and ensures that international students receive the high-quality education they expect and deserve. By strengthening oversight, enhancing transparency and ensuring sustainable growth, this bill protects our reputation as a leading destination for international students. It supports the economic and social contributions of international students to our nation while fostering a positive and enriching experience for students from all over the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, for his work on these reforms. I commend the bill to the House and urge all members to support its passage. Together, we can ensure that Australia remains a top destination for international students.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024. The bill has two broad objectives: first, to improve integrity and reduce fraud in the international student sector; second, to create a legislative basis for enrolment limits for international education providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the first objective of improving integrity in the international student education system. This sector has seen a rise in bad-faith education institutions in recent years. The bill will ensure that institutions are providing students with the high-quality education Australia is known and reputed for and not just a visa. The bill will crack down on the shonks and crooks by ensuring publication of performance data about education agents, stopping education agents moving students between institutions for significant commissions, creating powers to pause registration of new institutions and requiring providers to teach domestic students for two years before enrolling international students. I support these changes, because I agree with the minister that they uphold our reputation as one of the best countries in the world in which to study. That's a reputation we should be proud of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am, however, concerned that the second objective of this bill—the proposed enrolment limits—will undermine the very reputation we're seeking to uphold. As an independent member of this place, I review each bill on its merits. Often, it's not an easy task. When assessing new legislation, I ask myself: What is the problem this legislation is attempting to solve? What is the case for change? How can we uphold proper ethical and governance standards? How can we ensure it's delivering for Australians in the regions? How will it affect my constituents in Indi?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After interrogating this bill and meeting with the vice-chancellors and senior leaders of universities in my electorate, I have some serious concerns. I cannot support the bill while enrolment limits remain. The bill as it stands would give the education minister broad-ranging powers to limit the number of international students a university or TAFE can enrol. That's not only at an institution-wide level but right down to the individual course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've met with the minister—I'm really grateful for his time and that of his senior staff—to express my concerns, and the minister says that these measures are designed to secure the sustainable growth of the sector. But I have four key issues with the enrolment framework proposed in the bill: it has a very high risk of damaging regional universities, it seems to me like bad public policy, it's risky for our economy and it fails the ethical governance test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, regarding the impact on regional universities, in my electorate, Charles Sturt University and La Trobe University are key contributors to the community, employing more than 500 local people and providing courses in areas like nursing and teaching that are vital to communities across north-east Victoria. Regional universities like Charles Sturt and La Trobe University are essential if we're to have any hope of addressing the workforce shortages that exist right across regional, rural and remote Australia. They are essential if we're to get more regional Australians into university and meet the government's target of 80 per cent tertiary education attainment by 2050, and this is a huge challenge in rural, regional and remote Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the minister has said that this bill will benefit regional universities and TAFEs, he has provided no strong evidence to support this. I'm sceptical because the Universities Accord review, the government's blueprint for the education sector for the next decade, didn't recommend enrolment limits. It said that any regulation, like enrolment limits, will most likely benefit the large, city based universities. Put simply, this is because the evidence shows that, regardless of government policy, the vast majority of international students want to study in Australia's major cities. If they can't study in a major city then most won't come at all. This is a global trend, and one that enrolment limits are unlikely to change. That's why most regional universities also have metropolitan campuses. Charles Sturt's metro campuses brought in $135 million in revenue prior to the pandemic. This revenue is crucial to regional universities, and it doesn't fund flashy new buildings. It funds the core amenities and services that benefit regional students and regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Regional Universities Network is clear that the ongoing viability of regional universities is directly linked to international enrolments at their metropolitan campuses, but the regions have witnessed the slowest post-COVID recovery in international student numbers, and this government's stricter visa conditions are making things even tougher. Visa refusal rates are skyrocketing, particularly at smaller and regional universities. Already this year, La Trobe University has seen a $75 million reduction in international student revenue and has foreshadowed job cuts in the coming months. Federation University and the University of Tasmania are also planning for major cuts. Universities Australia doesn't mince its words and says that the sector is staring down the barrel of thousands of job losses, with the ongoing viability of regional universities at stake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education experts and universities in my electorate are clear that this bill risks making a bad situation worse. This bill, as it currently stands, risks making a bad situation worse. Professor Andrew Norton says that the government's model 'would cause actual enrolments to fall well below the official maximum number'. Charles Sturt says that the risk of penalties means most universities will operate well below the official cap to avoid going over it and attracting penalties. Put simply, regional universities are the least able to absorb any further reductions in international student revenue. If these job losses and course cuts eventuate, they will have a devastating impact on communities in my electorate and right across regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this government pursuing enrolment limits if universities and higher education experts are against it and if, as the evidence suggests, it won't be effective? The answer to this question leads to my second issue with this bill. This bill has been introduced at a time when both the government and the opposition want to reduce migration to ease pressure on the housing market, and the minister has linked this bill with the housing crisis by saying that, if universities build more housing, they will receive a higher enrolment cap. That sounds alright at face value, and, while I support measures that will address the housing crisis, I am concerned that Universities Australia are right when they say that this legislation is a rushed response to political issues the government wants to address before the next election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the International Education Association of Australia, international students are facing a blame game as the only migration market to Australia that can easily be reduced. In only the five years I've been a member of this parliament, I've seen governments of both stripes flip-flop on their treatment of international students, depending on where the political winds are blowing. In 2020, the former government told international students to go home as the pandemic raged. In 2022, they asked them to come back by uncapping work rights to address critical shortages in hospitality, cleaning, retail and the disability and aged-care sector. Then, in 2023, the current government extended the poststudy work rights of international students to help address critical skills shortages and drive economic growth. But now it wants to cut numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of this government rightly criticised the former government's policies at the time, describing them—I quote—as 'distorting student choice and corrupting the market', a 'Ponzi scheme' for unscrupulous international education providers. But now this government is putting forward a bill that few in the sector have asked for and is unlikely to be effective. This competition on who can be toughest on international students is a cynical and unfair play from the government, and it is not in Australia's national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That leads to my third issue with this bill: it's bad economics. International education is Australia's fourth-largest export, bringing in $48 billion per year. In Victoria, it's the third-largest export, bringing in $6.9 billion in revenue and supporting more than 40,000 jobs. International students don't just pay student fees; they spend on food and retail services and they drive local economies. They drive more than 50 per cent of international tourism spending in regional Australia. When I go to the Bright Autumn Festival or when I go up to the snowfields in my electorate, I see the families of international students constantly; they are having a marvellous time visiting regional Australia. Without international students, Australia would likely be in a recession right now. So, while I recognise the importance of a sustainable international education sector and I support measures in this bill that will help stamp out the unscrupulous actors, the economic impacts of the government's proposals are likely to be self-defeating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when workforce shortages across Australia are on the rise, we can't start turning away students that can fill these gaps. Regional Australia needs more nurses, more aged-care workers, more builders and more engineers. We need to support our homegrown talent, but we also need to bring in the best and brightest from overseas. This bill undermines these objectives. Of course, it's not just about the money. International students are invaluable members of our community, each bringing a little more of the world to Australia. When they head home, as the minister himself says, a bit of Australia rubs off onto them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My final issue with this bill is that it's poor governance, with a significant level of ministerial power. As drafted, this bill will give the Minister for Education wide-ranging control over the international education sector, right down to the number of students a provider can enrol in a particular course. I am uncomfortable with the wide-ranging powers the minister would have over our fourth-largest export sector, and so are universities in my electorate. It's a significant intrusion of ministerial power into the business operations of universities and TAFEs and an intrusion I don't think the government has sufficiently explained. We need to bring in legislation that is future proof and minister proof.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot support this bill while enrolment limits remain. But there are amendments I would support that would limit some of the negative consequences I've outlined. I support the member for North Sydney's amendments that would limit ministerial power to set institution-level caps only, removing the power to set course-level caps, which would have been universally rejected by the sector. I'm also concerned that there is no legislative requirement for the minister to consult with the sector when designing enrolment limits. Charles Sturt University says that the bill was introduced with little warning and little consultation. They worry that the government's rushed timelines mean that they will be negotiating caps without knowing crucial details. This might result in having to rescind student offers, causing reputational damage to the university and Australia's international standing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would support amendments that strengthen the requirements for the minister to consult with universities and TAFEs and the broader sector before creating enrolment limits. I have no doubt the minister intends to consult with the sector, but legislation needs to be future proof. We need to take the risk out of this legislation. We need to know that a future education minister can't use the powers to drastically change the international education industry overnight. The powers proposed in this bill contain no adequate guard rails and an inadequate explanation of why they are necessary. I would support amendments that inserted a sunset clause to ministerial powers so that proposed powers would lapse or be transferred to the proposed Australian Tertiary Education Commission—free of political influence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this bill can be repaired, but I can't support it until it is. To reiterate: I support the reforms included in this bill that would improve integrity and reduce fraud in the international education sector. I want international students to be protected from unscrupulous actors and supported to achieve their educational ambitions, and I also recognise that the sustainable growth of the sector is important so that Australia can remain an enviable destination for aspiring students across the world. There is a role for government in this crucial sector. But the enrolment limits proposed by this bill are lacking in evidence base. I am not convinced they will make our international sector more sustainable and I am concerned they will hurt regional universities and TAFEs in my electorate. If this bill is passed unamended, the minister for education would have sweeping powers over the international education sector, with little parliamentary oversight. I don't believe the government has made a clear case for why these powers are necessary. I would support amendments that would make a bad bill slightly better, but the fact remains: I won't be supporting this bill while enrolment limits remain.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I thank my friend the member for Indi for that contribution on the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024. There are some really good insights about regional unis. I would say, as somebody who ran this sector in Victoria under a Liberal government and then a Labor government, I think you have discounted the need for reform and some of the enrolment limits and I would be happy to talk with you further, should you wish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is our fourth-biggest export sector, and it's no trivial thing—it really isn't. It's critical to the economy and it's also critical to our universities, TAFES and many private businesses—most of them good, some of them bad. It's critical to young people's lives—people who choose to come in their formative years, generally, and study in Australia, many of whom stay on and build a life here. We should celebrate and welcome it when young people do choose Australia—it's a hypercompetitive global market, particularly at the upper end for talent. Students have many choices about where they go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most students are great. And I agree with the previous speaker that, too often, international students have been demonised. It should be a bipartisan thing. At the moment we seem to have descended with the Leader of the Opposition down the rabbit hole—no number is too low and no amount of damage to our fourth-biggest export sector is enough. We saw under the former government that the lobsters got their own planes to fly them around the world but the students were told to go home. It was a disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But for all the good, the soft power, the economic value, the internationalisation of our campuses, the student experience and curriculum, the skills and talent pipeline, and the broader contributions, there are also many negatives: the misuse of the student visa system and the completely unacceptable exploitation of students, as former police commissioner Christine Nixon found in her review. The social licence is at risk. I take the point about regional universities, but the previous speaker drew a catastrophic picture from stuff that simply isn't in the bill and, clearly, would never be done because it's government policy. It has been the policy of the former government and this government to do what we can to attract more students to regional universities. The notion that regional universities would somehow have draconian course caps put on them is just nonsensical, and all members need to be careful to take with a grain of salt some of the more extreme advocacy points that have been put to us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks a framework for government to manage the sector, and it is a major shift in how this significant market is managed. Currently, to be frank, governments—the previous government, our government and governments that will come afterwards if we don't have reform—have only two blunt tools to manage the sector, and there is very little active policy that shapes the international education sector onshore. The first of the two blunt tools is CRICOS, which is the registration for providers that provide to overseas students. CRICOS sets notional limits by floorspace, teachers, paperwork and stuff, and is completely divorced from the international education policy framework. There's no transparency and no certainty. That's one lever you've got—the registration process for providers that teach. The other lever you've got is visa approvals, both offshore and onshore. The offshore instrument is incredibly blunt and, often, is actually working against government policy to diversify the students onshore, because, frankly, it prioritises students who apply from China because they're very unlikely to overstay their visas. So we've got these two blunt instruments that work against all the policies which we stand up here and preach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The onshore application pathways are, frankly, misused and should be limited as soon as possible to cut numbers more quickly. I have no ill will towards the 'permanently temporary' visa holders—I've met many of them; they're decent people. But a person can come here to Australia to do a bachelor's degree, gain a post-study work rights visa and not find a skilled migration pathway as their English isn't good enough. They don't have the right skills and the labour market doesn't pick them up. They might do a master's and another student graduate pathway and then hop around from VET degree to VET degree for 10 years. That's got to be cut off—that really needs to stop. We've said that. It's not straightforward, I understand, from an IT point of view in Home Affairs, but with policy we have to find a way to stop that. It's not fair to those young people, and it creates horrible situations where people have spent most of their adult lives in our country and they'll never have a pathway to permanent residency. That does our society no good, and we need to do better with that. But we've got two blunt instruments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Andrew Norton, one of the great higher education thinkers, as mentioned by the previous speaker, has painted a binary set of options. I would actually say that both of these are to be avoided. No. 1 would be a bureaucratically allocated market with some kind of Soviet-style inefficiency—you don't want public servants allocating institution by institution, every year, course by course. No-one wants that. That's not what's being proposed, despite some of the caricatures we're hearing. The other option that I think you want to avoid is the cap-and-trade system. We don't want to set up a system that's effectively trading in people, and the minute you put it in you inflate the value of the places—like the taxi licence problem when Uber and other disruptors came in—and you privilege economic factors over all other factors. You basically drive the higher education system onshore to all teaching MBAs because they're the highest profit and lowest cost. Really? I think they're the two options you want to avoid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of policy should be to refine and evolve the current approach of CRICOS allocations linked to visa system planning levels and a policy framework so that our government and future governments can manage the number of students onshore. We hear all the screeching and hysterics from the Leader of the Opposition, who's always angry, always negative and always says no, and who loves to demonise migrants and play the little race card—nudge, nudge, wink, wink, and all of that stuff. We've seen it for 20 years in this country, with his performance. People know what he is; they know what he's like. But despite the current hysterics about international students, we actually need to get a policy framework and a way of governments managing the onshore system, because the truth is there is insatiable demand globally for people—young people, usually—to study onshore in Australia that can never be met. And it's about time we stopped trying to manage this through the blunt instruments of visa rejections and the CRICOS system and agreed on an adult way that the minister and future ministers can manage the sector and shape it to maximise the value for our country in every sense. Governments need mechanisms to manage the market; that's my proposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned about some of the language—I'm not talking about the substance, but some of the language—and we need to be careful to get this right. The problem with the political fight and the screeching about students being to blame, about how Australia doesn't want more students, and the negative signals that are being sent—we hear them in markets now. This is a word-of-mouth market. It's driven by the student experiences of those who are here, those who studied in Australia, and all the stuff ricochets around on social media. The problem is, if we just screech: 'Hard caps; cap, cap, cap. Hard limit; inflexible'—if that's what they're proposing; it's not what this bill means—that you send a negative market signal globally, which risks deterring the best students, the ones we want to attract who can go anywhere in the world. Canada saw this when they implemented their caps in the wrong way. It's a hypercompetitive market for talent. It's bad for soft-power human capital and research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also sets up an immediate and endless political football with the opposition of the day. The number will always sound big and scary and be misrepresented and misunderstood. And it does create, as the previous speaker noted from Andrew Norton's work, a market problem of underutilisation, an allocation problem and a lack of flexibility. In doing this, we need to be able to limit enrolments and manage the shape of the market onshore, but we need to do it in a way which includes sufficient flexibility. I've argued publicly for a range. You could call it a tolerance, but, whatever you want to call it, we actually want minimums as well as maximums. We don't just want to put a single number there, knowing that everyone will float below it. We want a signal that of course we want students, and we want valuable students. We do want providers to use their allocations, or whatever language you want to use. Once ranges or whatever are established, there should be an annual periodic process to allocate spare capacity and growth, and it should have a use-it-or-lose-it philosophy. We want to provide stability and certainty for providers and allocate capacity according to the policy frameworks to incentivise the behaviours we want: new housing, as the Treasurer and government are rightly pointing to; market diversification; and study in regional areas and so on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The critical question which we've never confronted as a country is: what is the shape of the onshore market that we want? That's an elephant in the room that has never been tackled. I think we need a policy framework alongside this, and I think the minister is consulting on a draft framework—well done, Minister—to maximise the overall value for Australia. We would look at things like the economic value, which tilts strongly towards higher education rather than VET. But we'd also look at the skills and talent pipeline. We want young people studying, particularly in vocational areas where they can make a contribution to Australia—if we can't have everyone onshore—and that tilts towards VET. That's because most of the in-demand occupations on the National Skills Shortage List are actually vocational and not higher ed. We want market diversity for soft power—spread the love—to hedge the risk of overreliance on a particular market and to enrich the student experience on campus. We want regional and geographic diversity within Australia, and we want to build our research links and capability. All of this may vary by location, but it does put the low-value private VET courses from the institutions that everybody knows are selling work visas, not student visas, that make no contribution to Australia in the gun. That's just a fact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're figuring out what the basis is, what the best way is, to manage future student numbers onshore. I would argue strongly against just making a hard link to net overseas migration to suit the political purposes of the Leader of the Opposition of the day. This one is pretty bad, but it will be a political temptation, as people have said, in the future. It would be a very blunt instrument just to link it to the NOM. It would swing wildly, and it would mean that domestic politics and other parts of the migration system would then drive the numbers in our fourth-biggest export sector. That would be economically chaotic, and it wouldn't be linked to the management of overall student numbers. No government can control the NOM perfectly from year to year because we can't control how many people leave Australia from year to year. These are just commonsense things, if you put the politics aside.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could link a number range to pre-COVID numbers in around 2019, plus or minus a few per cent. That probably has merit. I'd argue that we really should look at a share of the Australian population back to pre-COVID levels. We're currently floating at about 2.9 per cent of the Australian population being international students. The pre-COVID average was about 2.5. That would be sensible, and it would have the advantage of inbuilt growth, because there was, on average, 1.6 per cent in population growth each year pre-COVID. So we need to have that discussion, and we are having that discussion, with the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to think how we establish initial ranges by the sector. I would say that has to flow from the policy framework—rebaselining things and, particularly, rebalancing things between higher education and VET. But we have to focus more on where major providers were pre-COVID. There have been some blatant market share grabs—particularly, I'd point out, by a couple of the large New South Wales universities. Frankly, they've recruited large numbers of Chinese students and disadvantaged other universities which have been trying to do the right thing and diversify. So there does need to be some rebalancing. And, yes, governments will need to make sure that good private providers have an ongoing place in a managed market. That's so some of the bureaucracy, or the university snobbery that has been talked about by some of the regulators in years past, doesn't just wipe them out. That said, I have little to no sympathy for the bottom end of the private VET market, which has just profiteered post COVID and ballooned in market share.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my remaining minute, I will just make a remark on the course-level intervention power. Rightly, it has been made clear by the minister upfront that this is seen as a reserve power to be used rarely, and only if needed. I would say it's a stick, if needed, to link to quality and integrity issues—a stick to curb or stop low-value activities in the VET sector. It's also to be used, perhaps in a positive way at times, to allocate additional fixed places for high-value new courses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For what it's worth, I think that amendments are needed to the bill. I think they will be dealt with sensibly. They're being thought about by the government, and will be looked at through the Senate inquiry. The submissions to that are robust and good; it's a proper process. I do think personally—this is not government policy—that I'm not seeing the case being made, frankly, for course-level caps in the higher-ed sector. I think the case remains overwhelming for course-level caps power in the VET sector. There's a lot more I could say, but time will expire on me in about 10 seconds. I think this is an important debate, but members need to remember there's a long way to go on this. The government is listening, we're consulting, and people should take those consultation processes seriously.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Ten years ago, the Sunshine Coast was struggling with the challenge of youth unemployment. At that time, the community looked at each other and, instead of turning to government, instead of blaming corporates, decided to take control into their own hands and try to solve that very problem. They did so by coming together under a program and an organisation called Generation Innovation. Generation Innovation is a not-for-profit, the mission of which is to unleash the innovative genius of young people. Central to Generation Innovation's business model was something referred to as the GI Challenge—the Generation Innovation Challenge. It was an annual program that invited young people who thought they had an idea—may be also a pep in their step—and a willingness to try their hand at entrepreneurship. This, it was thought, could be an idea to positively and proactively address that challenge of youth unemployment. And it worked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, we will see the 10th anniversary of Generation Innovation's GI Challenge. In fact, it starts this very month. Over those 10 years, we have seen young people come into the program and be mentored by Sunshine Coast and Noosa business leaders. We have seen them grow enormously, because volunteers have come onboard who believe in unleashing the innovative genius of young people. We have had companies and other organisations sponsor either in kind or in cash to make sure that these young people have an opportunity. This is an opportunity that comes to young people who have their own idea, but the program allows them to commercialise their idea. This is not some school based, academic exercise but rather something that connects young people to the real market economy. Over those 10 years, the case studies have been extraordinary. Young people have gone from just an idea—nothing more than a lightbulb moment—through to establishing their own enterprises. Some of them are serial entrepreneurs now. Still to this day, Generation Innovation is run by a board of volunteers. My credit goes to Shane Cunningham, who is currently in the chair, and those board members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ten years ago, when my wife Sophia and I founded Generation Innovation, entrepreneurship and startups might have been part of the equation, but they weren't really what we were getting at. We saw an opportunity where young people could become local heroes to other people, not because they were smart, good looking or great at sport, but rather because they had the moral courage to take on an idea and try to commercialise it—because they had the guts to follow what they believed, and they were prepared to put in the hard work to make it happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In turn, the young people who were participants in this program previously and shall be again this year are the very ones who are showing inspiration to other young people who could be sitting on a couch, on the beach or in a car when they hear their stories, prompting them to say, 'You know what? If they can do that, maybe so too can I.' Therein lies the beauty of Generation Innovation and the GI Challenge. It's a community coming together to unleash the innovative genius of young people. GI challenge 2024, see you soon.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  There is no greater honour, really, as a member of parliament than supporting people in my community, in the electorate of Wills, with the challenges they face. I want to share some of the local stories that make up such a diverse and vibrant electorate of Wills in the northern suburbs of Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently visited Esftathia 'Effie' Spiropoulos, a proud Greek Australian in my community. That's not remarkable because there are a lot of great Greek Australians, but Effie turned 104 last month on 10 June, and my office organised a letter from King Charles and also from the Prime Minister to mark this very special and auspicious occasion. It's a special year for Effie because she also celebrated 60 years of living in the electorate of Wills and 44 years in the same home in the suburb of Fawkner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She had seven children, all born in Greece, along with 22 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren. Along with all seven children, she and her husband uprooted their entire family in 1964 to travel down under to the lucky country, and she adores Australia. She often refers to it as 'paradise on earth'. Effie and her family described what it was like to settle in Melbourne in multicultural Fawkner in the sixties and seventies. They had Anglo-Australian neighbours on one side, who helped them polish up their English skills. They had an Italian family on the other side with whom they'd exchange over the fence homemade salami and veggies that they grew in their veggie patch, and they spoke in broken English about their homelands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a real honour to meet with Effie and her family, her generous, happy and wonderful family—Stavroula, Georgina and Tassos, and there were a few of the kids there at the time—who welcomed me with open arms into the home that they grew up in. They baked a birthday cake, to top it off, and I felt very spoiled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Effie and all older Australians deserve our respect in their senior years, and they deserve a government that recognises their decades of contribution to our society and country by us looking after them in the right way. That means helping them access high quality healthcare and aged-care services and taking steps to ease cost-of-living pressures and improve their quality of life as older Australians. That's why this government has been working so hard to support older Australians by putting nurses back into nursing homes, providing residents with more time with carers, lifting wages in the sector and improving transparency and accountability. The latest budget supports pensioners by providing a $300 energy rebate, a tax cut for all Australians, a 10 per cent increase in the Commonwealth rent assistance scheme and a five-year freeze on the maximum cost of a PBS prescription for pensioners. This is all support for those older Australians who have given so much to this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also continued the 12-month freeze on social security deeming rates to ensure pension payments don't reduce. There are an extra 24,000 homecare packages to reduce waiting lists and support older Australians who want to age at home along with free vaccinations for aged-care residents, $190 million to assist older Australians recover from a hospital stay with short-term care through the extended transition care program and investments in better dementia care. We are also building a new Aged Care Act to place the rights and needs of older Australians at the heart of our aged-care system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to highlight some very deeply personal stories that give you a glimpse of what it's like when we show compassion as part of being members of parliament and part of being a government when it comes to our immigration system. Dilpreet Kaur is a single mother in my electorate of Wills who faced significant challenges as a victim of domestic violence. Her relationship breakdown meant that she no longer had access to her spousal visa pathway, putting her on a short-term visa with no study rights and making it hard for her to secure a job. She wasn't eligible for financial assistance. She had no family to lean on or to speak of. She lost her father at a young age and her brother to COVID more recently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite her young son being an Australian citizen, she outlined her fears of being returned to India, given her circumstances. She said that it would have been life-threatening for her to return in those circumstances. My office and I assisted her in pleading her case. I took that case up with the minister, as many of us do in this place, because of the ministerial intervention power. There was great news just a few weeks ago. Ms Kaur got her permanent residency granted, which was such a relief—a burden off her shoulders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is so pleasing that the Albanese Labor government is delivering support for victims-survivors of family and domestic violence, people who need that assistance. People who are fleeing that kind of persecution and violence are vulnerable and they need our support. That is what this government does and that is why it is an honour to represent those community members in my electorate and to help them every single day. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LLEW O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Australia's energy policy needs to be based on facts, not fear campaigns, and it needs to serve Australian families, businesses, manufacturing and industry. It must be affordable and it must be reliable. Australia can have this reliable and affordable secure energy future by repealing the nuclear moratorium legislation and by fostering an open and informed debate about the energy source which safely powers so many of the world's major economies, including the US and France. And Australia possesses all the tools to do this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia needs baseload nuclear energy to deliver the lowest-cost electricity generation to power our homes and businesses. Intermittent energy developments such as wind and solar are so reliant on the ever-changing weather and require such large backup they become very expensive. The system-wide spend needed to achieve the Labor government's radical renewable policies has been costed at over a trillion dollars. The current debate around nuclear energy, unfortunately, marked by Labor's use of a three-eyed fish from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Simpsons</span> from the 1990s, conveniently ignores the fact that Australia already has a very long-running, very effective and very safe nuclear reactor producing life-saving medicines in Australia. This raises the question: if we are willing to use an open pool nuclear reactor to save lives, why won't we use nuclear technology to power our nation? This inconsistency in the Albanese government's stance on energy extends to national security as well. While opposing nuclear power for energy, the government supports submerging nuclear power plants into submarines together with the personnel who operate them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's current targets of 82 per cent renewables by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050 are already proving to be unachievable and very expensive under Labor's radical plan. The government's focus should not be on the percentage target of renewables but on achieving affordable and reliable electricity for Australians. The coalition's approach is transparent, advocating for seven firm baseload nuclear power sites on expiring coal-fired power station sites. Locating nuclear plants on these sites would negate the need for Labor's intrusive and environmentally and economically destructive 28,000 kilometres of new transmission lines. Our plan includes a 2½ year consultation process to ensure transparency and community engagement. Your voice matters to the coalition in shaping our energy policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the Albanese government has not engaged in meaningful consultation in its ad hoc production of so-called green energy projects, many of which will end up as stranded assets. Labor has ignored communities and, in Queensland, green rent seekers seek taxpayer subsidies and operate outside legal frameworks that prevent agricultural enterprises and landholders from managing vegetation on their own land. These so-called green renewable projects lead to the destruction of mountaintops and compulsory acquisition of private property for transmission lines, and they destroy native habitat and environmental assets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nuclear power, on the other hand, requires a fraction of the land that the industrial-scale wind and solar factories occupy, making nuclear a vastly more efficient and friendly option. Securing Australia's energy future to include zero-emission, safe, reliable and affordable nuclear energy is a key priority for the coalition government and will be achieved under a Dutton-Littleproud government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  An estimated 250,000 Australians live with ME/CFS, with approximately 25 per cent experiencing severe disability that renders them either housebound or bedbound. This is a gendered disease where close to 80 per cent of victims are, in fact, women. ME/CFS is a complex multisystem disease. With limited treatments, management aims to reduce symptom severity to restore quality of life. As constituent Jenny Meagher put it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Silent and invisible, armies of people … have been doggedly fighting from our beds for over two decades for unsafe clinical guidelines to be replaced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 20 June, health minister Mark Butler announced $1.1 million to the NHMRC, our peak research and medical body, to develop new Australian clinical guidelines for ME/CFS in consultation with patient groups, health professionals and medical scientists. 'Keyboards rattled as a silent cheer erupted,' as Jenny said. These long overdue guidelines will provide a roadmap for health professionals and a compass for researchers, pointing them in the direction of gaps in knowledge that need to be filled with evidence. It's time to chart these invisible illnesses on that map. Momentum gathered with the long-COVID-19 parliamentary inquiry delivered by the health committee in April of last year, which I am part of. I reflect that it is a shame that it took a pandemic to reinvigorate this conversation. I know that many of our Higgins community, people like Jenny and Peter Meagher, along with Emerge Australia, have campaigned tirelessly on this issue, despite years of doubt and disregard. Their voices have been heard. The Albanese government is taking action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to also discuss the issue of supermarkets and prices Australians are being charged at supermarkets. Australians are feeling the pinch. They are experiencing not only a cost-of-living crisis but something that has been termed a 'cost-of-eating crisis'. For some, household budgets are in the red, and, for many, a trip to the supermarket is actually making them see red. Why? Because they are clued in to the fake discounts and what is termed 'asymmetric price transmission', which is a technical way of saying that prices at supermarkets tend to be jacked up as soon as produce hikes occur, such as for meat. But, as those meat prices start to fall, it takes a lot longer for the prices to fall at the checkout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Supermarkets are making record billion-dollar profits. Coles in 2023 recorded a profit of $1.1 billion. Woolies recorded $1.6 billion. Both results were over four per cent higher than the year before. This is all occurring at a time when farmers are being squeezed or silenced and not getting a fair deal at the farm gate. They are essentially being asked to produce more for less. Australians know that we have one of the most concentrated supermarket sectors in the world, with Coles and Woolies dominating, controlling about 65 per cent of market share, and Aldi 10 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what are we doing about it? We tasked consumer group CHOICE with $1.1 million to undertake quarterly consumer surveys over the next three years. The last one was released just recently, and it was revealing. It showed that a standard grocery basket is around 25 per cent cheaper at Aldi compared to the other supermarkets. This is significant. It actually forced me to change my behaviour, and Australians are voting with their feet. I have started doing most of my shopping at Aldi, and I found that a trolley of groceries for a family of four is about $50 to $60 cheaper. That is a significant saving. I've undertaken split-basket shopping. I do my main shop at one supermarket and I might pick up a few goodies at the other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also undertook the Emerson review, looking at the supermarket Food and Grocery Code of Conduct, and we have accepted the findings. In particular, we have rejected the coalition's call for the forced break-up of supermarkets—forced divestiture. This has been roundly condemned by many experts, including Graeme Samuel, the former chair of the ACCC, who described it as shocking populism, and it is. It will have unintended consequences that may actually lead to greater market concentration and greater price increases.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="240756" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  I rise to update the House on my fight to deliver radiation treatment services for the Limestone Coast. To recap, my advocacy in this space began in 2018, when the Radiation Therapy Advisory Group, RTAG, began their campaign to raise the profile of radiation therapy across Australia to ensure it was adequately funded by government. The campaign highlighted to me the need for the then coalition government to bridge the radiation therapy gap that's clearly evident in rural and regional Australia, leading to suboptimal cancer treatment in many parts of regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian studies show that the optimal rate of utilisation for radiation therapy is 48.3 per cent across all cancers, but the current level of utilisation in Australia continues to sit at between 35 and 40 per cent. Another way of looking at this is that 14.2 per cent of Australian cancer patients who would benefit from access to radiation oncology currently miss out. One in three cancer patients in Australia receive radiation treatment, but in Europe and North America that number is one in two. A key barrier to radiation therapy is lack of access and distance from a treatment centre is one of the biggest contributors to this inequity. The impact of scarce clinical facilities means the choice and experience of Australians in cancer treatment is variable between those living in the cities and those living in urban or regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2018 my home state of South Australia was one of the very few states they didn't have a radiation treatment service outside its capital city, and today South Australia is the only state that doesn't have one of those treatment facilities in its regions. In 2019 the coalition government and the then minister for health, Greg Hunt, announced that $63.4 million would be allocated across 13 sites in regional communities, and I was thrilled that a diligent campaign run by my community saw Mount Gambier and the Limestone Coast identified as one of those sites. Finally cancer patients in the south-east of South Australia had a light at the end of the tunnel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can imagine my utter dismay and disgust at learning that the promised funding allocated for Mount Gambier and Limestone Coast could not be delivered, because the South Australian state government said it wouldn't partner with the federal government. I make no lie of the fact that that decision was made under a Liberal state government. I acknowledged it at the time, but it makes no difference to me. The fact is that the Limestone Coast community wants radiation treatment services, and the then federal coalition government made funding available to make it happen. We had a private provider interested in delivering the service, but agreement simply couldn't be reached with the state government to help facilitate its delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An election in South Australia meant a different administration. I hoped once again for a light at the end of the tunnel, but I was again disappointed, as the incoming Labor government also said no. What happened then was what always happens in my community: a dedicated group of passionate people got together, many of them with lived experience, and said: 'Do you know what? This isn't good enough. We've got to take up the fight.' This group of volunteers, many of them dealing with their own cancer journeys, gathered 16,000 online signatures and 4,000-odd hard-copy signatures, calling on the state government to change its mind on this decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The state government planned at that time to spend the $4.3 million secured by me for radiation services in my community on consulting suites at the hospital instead, and even an upgrade to the car park—not cancer treatment services but a car park. The petition halted those plans, and the state minister agreed to execute a feasibility study. The feasibility study is now to hand, and it's with the Limestone Coast Local Health Network. But the community of the Limestone Coast will not be privy to this report for another month, according to the chair of that group. Apparently, the local health network will study the report and hand recommendations to the state minister before signatories to the petition and volunteers who garnered them will be privy to what it says. Shame! Yet again, these dedicated volunteers from the Limestone Coast are being kept in the dark—a regional community being treated like mugs. What an irony that the minister who lectures us about taking advice from the local health network is forcing them to keep this report confidential.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  Community is at the heart of Tangney. I have had the pleasure of meeting many of the Tangney community leaders and learning about their countless contributions. They are leaders who bring together local groups and individuals to help improve lives—leaders who create and strengthen a sense of belonging. They promote harmony, reduce isolation and do their best to make everyone feel welcome and included. I want to acknowledge all our community heroes in Tangney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Andy Lau is a lead staff member at Chorus Aged Care Service, located at the Bull Creek Community Centre in Tangney. Together with more than 24 support workers and 40 volunteers, the service provides in-home care, a multicultural day centre and many other services for more than 500 residents in Tangney. When I first met Andy at Bull Creek Community Centre, he was working alongside local senior citizens, volunteers and people with disability. They were all working together to provide Christmas food parcels for the disadvantaged families in the community. It is a wonderful hive of activities. Their teamwork brought the project to life. This is not an uncommon story in Tangney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, teamwork is at the heart of Tangney sporting clubs, on the field or on the court but also behind the scenes. David Timmel of Melville City Hockey Club, Nick Gorht of Murdoch University Melville Cricket Club, Mark Hallet of Applecross Cricket Club, Bryan Raeburn of Murdoch University Melville Football Club, Peter Coombs of the Leeming Spartan Cricket Club and Jim Sewell of Blue Gum Park Tennis Club are presidents of some of Tangney's vital community organisations. I am proud that the Albanese Labor government has supported these local sporting clubs by delivering upgrades, from new cricket nets to new clubrooms. It is great to see our election commitment being delivered. While these community organisations focus on sport, their reach and impact extend far beyond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also delivered an election commitment to enhance the space at Melville Community Men's Shed. Led by President Quentin Wilson, the Melville Community Men's Shed is an opportunity for fellowship, support and collaboration. The Rhein-Donau Club and president Steve Schlegel help the community enjoy the culture, music and food of the countries Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Jeyendran Ramachandran of the volunteer-run Association of Malaysians in Western Australia brings the Malaysian community together through cultural and religious celebrations. Ana Coelho and the Bateman Winthrop Scout Group help young people to be their best. The WA Multicultural Lyons Club was established in 2023 following the initiative of Rasa Subramaniam—we call him uncle—and their support of CALD communities is much needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The WA Multicultural Lions Club was one of the many recipients of this year's $10 million 2023-24 volunteer grant rounds, receiving funding to support volunteers. In Tangney, 33 local volunteer-run community nonprofits each received a grant. Others were organisations such as playgroups and seniors groups and sporting clubs such as Riverton Football Club, organised by Luke McCorkell. Tangney is full of clubs and organisations that are led by volunteers. I would love to mention each and every organisation in Tangney, but unfortunately this speech is really limited to just five minutes, and I would need much, much more time to name them all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the cost of living impacting many Australians, volunteer-run groups are the fabric of our community. We are fortunate to have such dedicated community leaders who have a passion for making our Tangney community better and stronger every day. I give my heartfelt thanks to everyone who makes a difference in our community. Thank you to all the volunteers and community leaders in Tangney; thank you very much.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  The influence of early childhood education and care cannot be overstated. It's transformational. Children who receive high-quality education in their earliest years do better in school and at work. They grow up healthier and happier and lead more fulfilling lives. But across Australia, particularly in regional Australia, the early childhood education and care system is struggling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I visit early childhood education and care centres across my electorate, they all tell me the same story. They struggle to recruit, train and retain enough staff to meet community demand. In Wangaratta and Wodonga, there are 0.4 places per child. That's less than half the needed places. In places like Corryong, this can drop as low as 0.2 places per child. This means that four in five children will miss out on child care in their local community. Families are forced to wait for months or years on waitlists or take extreme measures to access child care. Take Megan Callus from Laceby, in my electorate of Indi. Megan has been waiting for more than two years for a childcare place to become available at her nearest centre in Wangaratta. In the meantime, she's forced to drive her daughter to Benalla—an hour round trip twice a day requiring extra time and extra cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When parents can't access child care, it's disproportionately women who will leave the workforce to provide that care. This reinforces the gender pay gap and makes it harder for women to balance motherhood and work. Study after study shows that there is a direct correlation between the accessibility of child care and workforce participation of mothers with a child under five years of age. We also know that there's enormous untapped economic potential from getting more parents into the workforce. Even conservative estimates put this in the billions of dollars per year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why I'm working to tackle childcare shortages across regional Australia, including in my electorate of Indi. This month I'll be hosting two play-date events in Wodonga and Wangaratta with the Parenthood, one of Australia's leading advocacy groups on early education and care. I want to hear from parents and families in my electorate about what childcare shortages mean for them to understand the impacts and challenges as I work for solutions. If you're a parent, a carer, a childcare worker, a grandparent or anyone who wants to share your story of childcare access, then join me on 17 July at the Wodonga library at Hyphen from 10 to 12 and at the Wangaratta Library from 2 until 4 pm. It will be a place to talk with other young families, hear of others' experiences and ask how we can make our childcare system work for us.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:34</span>):  I see my job in this place as being taking my community's local values, coming here and delivering national results for them. That's why over recent months I've been hosting 'Parliament in the Park' events in Joondanna, Yokine, Tuart Hill, Mount Hawthorn, Bedford, Embleton and Menora, getting out, listening to the community and hearing what they want from me. In addition, I've been doing community doorknocks with some wonderful volunteers across Bayswater, Osborne Park, East Perth, Morley, Highgate, Coolbinia, Dianella, North Perth, Maylands and Inglewood. That is why I'm so confident that Labor's budget and the big package that we delivered for the electorate of Perth on 1 July was the right plan not just for Perth but for Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Perth some 96,000 taxpayers got a tax cut of, on average, $1,791 each. To put that in WA terms, that's 16.5 tonnes worth of iron ore for taxpayers in Western Australia. And 76,000 taxpayers in Perth are getting a bigger tax cut because of decisions that we made this year. That's enough people to fill HBF Park in Highgate three times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really pleased that we're working with the Cook Labor government to provide $700 in energy bill relief to help every household in Perth and also help a range of small businesses. We have also done our job of freezing PBS prescription costs, making sure that people have certainty in how much their medication is going to cost them. Western Australians across WA saved $36 million as a result. That is enough to get you into Bayswater Waves four million times, or once every day for 12,000 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to move now from the budget works to some other important books. The Perth electorate is home to a wonderful bookstore, a great small business: Beaufort Street Books. Beaufort Street Books has been serving the community for years and years. It is a beloved business of Jane Seaton, an excellent member of the Perth community. Beaufort Street Books is moving 50 metres up the road, along Beaufort Street. They will still be Beaufort Street Books, but they're going to a new home. As a result, the community is coming together on 20 July to help with that move. I'm calling on my community in Perth to help with the community conveyor belt. The community conveyor belt has to move 12,000 books, handing them one at a time down the road to make sure that this beloved small business can get to its new home. I will be there passing some books along and I also encourage anyone in the Perth electorate to come along and help this business that's helped people of all ages, especially children, find a love of reading. There'll be a community sausage sizzle afterwards. I look forward to seeing people there.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:37</span>):  I rise to speak about two national icons within my electorate of Hughes. The first is cricket, our national sport. As a self-confessed cricket tragic, last Sunday it was a privilege for me to attend the presentation day of the Sutherland Shire Junior Cricket Association. The association has proudly seen the likes of Steve Smith from his under-10s days through to captaining the Australian men's team. The association fields 1,000 players in 97 teams in their Saturday-morning competition. Importantly, this includes 95 girls. The association has nine girls-only teams, and this is an amazing credit to President Matt O'Brien and the executive team that have led this association so successfully. When I wanted to play cricket as a young girl, there were no girls teams, only boys teams. However, I'm delighted to see that in one generation we have seen tremendous growth in women's cricket, where our Australian team is well known and our WBBL teams are attracting great crowds and sponsorship money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was fabulous to see the emerging talent from the shire's cricket association, both boys and girls, on the weekend. Australian fast bowler Maitlan Brown joined us, which was greatly appreciated, particularly by the many female players in the room. You cannot be what you cannot see. Her presence on the day and her feats on the field have inspired countless budding creditors and provided great encouragement to those players at the awards day. So congratulations to the association in all of its forms: the players, the parents, the scorers, the managers, the coaches and the administrators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Koalas are an iconic but endangered Australian native. I have healthy colonies of koalas living in my electorate of Hughes, in Heathcote National Park and around Sandy Point. However, about 10 per cent of these koalas are being killed each year on Heathcote Road, and the government response on this has been nothing but <span style="font-style:italic;">Utopia</span>. The koalas cross Heathcote Road in mating season, and this season is about to begin again in September. The solution is simple: we need a fence urgently built around Deadmans Creek. This will prevent the koalas from crossing the road. They can then cross under the creek.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have written to the federal government, the Minister for the Environment and Water and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, and what have they done? They have kicked the can down the road and said it's the New South Wales government's role. I have now written to the Premier of New South Wales, as well as the New South Wales department of transport, calling on them to simply put into practice a report that has been sitting on the desk of the department of transport now since 2001. It is not an expensive spend at this stage; we're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, not hundreds of millions of dollars. So I call on the state and federal governments to urgently fund this project to keep our koalas safe into the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Social Services and Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:40</span>):  This week, so much of the Albanese Labor government's cost-of-living measures have come into effect, from 1 July. This is really important right across the country, particularly in my region, on the far north coast of New South Wales. We all know people are doing it tough, and I know in my area they certainly have been. That's why we have continued to respond by offering important cost-of-living relief. We know there is more to do, but this makes such a big difference to people in my area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, our tax cuts for every single taxpayer across the country: for my area, 71,000 people will receive a tax cut so people can keep more of what they earn. This has been a huge issue, and people have responded very positively to the fact that they are getting that tax cut. On average, in my area, it's $1,384 that people will be receiving with that tax cut. It will make a really important difference when it comes to the cost of living. Of course, there's the energy bill relief: there will be $300 for every household and $325 for eligible small businesses. Again, this is a major issue that people have raised with me, and it's really important to have this in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, for my area, one of the other major cost-of-living initiatives is the freeze on the cost of PBS medicines. Particularly for a large number of elderly people in my region, I know first hand what a difference it will make for them. This is on top of our policies that are already in place for cheaper medicines and, of course, our tripling of the bulk-billing incentive as well. Accessing health care when you need it is vitally important, particularly for those older Australians with often very complex care needs. So many people in my area are very pleased to have that freeze on the PBS medicines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we've got the freeze on deeming rates too, which for retirees is vitally important. We also see some of the really strong action that we're taking when it comes to cost-of-living relief in our wiping of about $3 billion from student HECS debt. Again, many students have those major HECS debts, and we've acted on that, because we've listened to people's concerns first hand about what needs to be in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these cost-of-living measures come on top of a third consecutive pay rise for 2.6 million workers that we backed as a government, because it's important they have that pay rise. All of these measures build on some of the many ones we've already delivered, such as cheaper child care, fee-free TAFE and, as I said, the biggest expansion in bulk-billing as well. We've also had major investments in building more houses and increases to paid parental leave, which is so vitally important, particularly for women in terms of them being able to access the workforce. It's great for families and it's great for the economy. Right across the country we've had such a huge range of cost-of-living measures to help people who are really doing it tough.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:43</span>):  The 94th Mudgeeraba Agricultural Show was held last weekend, on 29 and 30 June. The Mudgeeraba show is a very traditional agriculture show where you would find everything that you would expect there to be at such a show. There were equestrian events and competitions. There were cattle, sheep, goats and poultry. I did even see a young alpaca walking around. There was woodchopping. There were arts and crafts. There were quilt displays. There were many heritage vehicles there that made quite the entrance in the grand parade. There were farriers, there was pig racing and of course there was an animal nursery that was very popular with people of all ages. As you would imagine, there was plenty to eat and drink and there was a very impressive sideshow alley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year the weather was kind, unlike some years in the past where heavy and very consistent rain had turned the show site into quite a mud pool. As the president of the Mudgeeraba show, Melanie Bryson, has said previously, 'Here at the showgrounds we've put the mud into Mudgeeraba.' I have to say that, rain or shine, the Mudgeeraba show does go on and no-one's spirits are at all dampened during that time. Whilst I don't have the official attendance numbers from the show, there were certainly very good crowds—from our very, very young to our very much loved seniors and everyone in between—and I can assure you that everyone I saw was having a great time. Congratulations to the president and her team for another fantastic show. I look forward to all that the Mudgeeraba show has to offer in its 95th year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the show, I took the opportunity to ask Gold Coasters about the issues that were important to them. I asked people specifically about the issues that are most often raised with me, and I asked them to let me know which was the most important to them. The top issue was crime. This was followed very closely by cost of living and then transport. Let me break down each of those points just a little bit in the time that I have remaining, starting with crime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are constantly speaking to me about crime. If you look on the Facebook community pages, what you see is that, day after day, there are reports of crime happening. People's houses are being broken into. Their cars are being stolen. We know that it is a huge issue, and we all need to work together to make sure that we try and solve this problem. With cost of living, people speak to me the most about the cost of housing, whether it's to buy or to rent. They speak to me secondly about the cost of groceries, because their budget is not stretching as far as it used to. Very briefly, with transport, the Gold Coast is a very different city to other cities around Australia. It is a linear city, and that means that our transport solutions have to be very specific to meet our needs.</span>

He was happiest with his friends, spending hours upon hours online gaming. No-one was happier than Eamon when it was announced that eSports would be introduced in the 2028 Olympics. It was no surprise that Eamon's love of eSports translated to a fulfilling career in the IT industry, where he made so many friends. Many of those work colleagues joined family and friends at a memorial service celebrating Eamon's life on 30 May, a service that was so well attended that the chapel opened all the doors and all the windows so that the large crowd outside could participate and show their respect as well. To Eamon's parents, Pam and Anthony, to his partner, Bronte, and to his three brothers, Brayton, Rohan and Sean, I send my very heartfelt sympathies.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During National Volunteer Week in May, I had the opportunity to express my deep gratitude to some wonderful constituents of mine in the 2024 Lilley Volunteers Awards. I recognised 31 incredible individuals, community groups and businesses who volunteer their time, skills and expertise for the benefit of our northside community. These volunteers are essential to the Lilley community, and their selfless contributions make all of our lives better. I would like to give a particular shout-out to those who received the Elaine Darling Lifetime Contribution to Volunteering Award. The recipients of this award each have made exemplary contributions to the community through their volunteer work for over 15 years. This award was presented to Joy Nielson, Leanne Eggins, Angela Flaherty, Barry Collis, Thomas Grice, Anne Templeton, Patricia Carbis, Maureen Seargent, Ludmilla Doneman, Andrea Rhind and Melinda Day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:48</span>):  It's a pleasure to rise today to recognise two local recipients in the recent King's Birthday Honours list. Ken Gourlay was awarded an Order of Australia for service to sailing, and he certainly has given a great deal of his life to sailing. Coming from a sailing family, he is the Vice Commodore and a life member of the Tamar Yacht Club. He has competed in several Sydney Hobart yacht races and the Three Peaks Yacht Race and has introduced many young people to the sport. In November 2006 he set off on a quest to sail around the world alone, nonstop and unassisted. He completed the circumnavigation in the record time of less than 180 days, raising over $100,000 for the Clifford Craig Medical Research Trust in the process. He was awarded the key to the City of Launceston in 2007 for his efforts, was Tasmanian Australian of the Year in 2008 and, in 2010, was inducted into the Tasmanian Sailing Hall of Fame. Although his citation is for service to sailing, it is also a tribute to his generous nature and his life of philanthropy. Mr Gourlay said he was flattered by the recognition, although it was unexpected, saying, 'Sailing has given me this whole wonderful life and taken me places, and this is another thing it has helped me achieve.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Launceston based business leader Michael Bailey was also recognised with a Medal of the Order of Australia in the honours list. Mr Bailey has had a distinguished career in business and industry, being CEO of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for over a decade, with previous roles including with the Launceston Chamber of Commerce, TasBuild, the Tasmanian Biosecurity Advisory Committee and RDA Tasmania. He won a national marketing award in 2009 whilst marketing manager at Country Club Tasmania, after an early career in the media. He's a keen cyclist and a former president of the Launceston City Cycling Club and is a passionate advocate for Tasmania and everything it has to offer, saying:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I have the best job in Tasmania, I get to deal with amazing businesses all the time that are inspirational and to be part of a Tasmania that has grown so much after the last few decades…people want to come to us and they want to buy our products, they value Tasmania as a brand and I feel proud to be part of the community of businesses that have made that happen.</span>

I've had the pleasure of getting to know both of these gentlemen well over the years, and I know both to be very humble and unassuming men that care deeply for their community. These honours are a well-deserved recognition of their lifetime of service and their contribution to the community of Tasmania.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry and Science</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:51</span>):  On 11 July this year, the 29th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide will be marked. This day is always hardest and heaviest for Bosnians, as it represents one of the darkest chapters in modern history: the events that, horrifically, occurred in Srebrenica. This month, we remember all the 8,372 Bosnians, mainly men and boys, brutally massacred on 11 July 1995, in what was later, rightfully, deemed a genocide by the International Court of Justice. When one thinks about this terrible and tragic event, it's inconceivable to believe what people are capable of doing to one another because of who they are. What fuelled Srebrenica was discrimination—a whole people demonised and treated as less than human because of their ethnicity and, principally, religion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, these black marks still exist in our world today. On 11 July, think of the mothers, because there is nothing that can prepare any mother for the news that many of them would have heard in that terrible time: that they had lost their husband or their sons, or both, and that they may have been lying somewhere in nameless graves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The youngest victim of the Srebrenica genocide was two-day-old Fatima Muhic, her tiny coffin buried alongside nearly 8,000 other graves at the Potocari memorial centre. This year, the United Nations has taken a significant step, acknowledging the gravity of this atrocity by declaring 11 July as the International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica. I wish to emphasise to Bosnian communities in New South Wales and across the country that the Australian government took seriously the step to support the resolution to designate an official day, 11 July, to honour the memory of the victims and remember their suffering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each year, the Australian Bosnian-Herzegovinian Cultural Association holds commemorations for the Srebrenica genocide. This is an incredibly crucial moment to help those still traumatised by the events of Srebrenica. Many managed to flee somehow and were then given the opportunity to rebuild their lives in our great country. Their tireless work means that the memories of those who lost their lives are kept alive and honoured. We owe it to the victims of Srebrenica and other crimes against humanity that we witness before our eyes to protect and do whatever we can to speak up and protect future generations from such horrors.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:54</span>):  Today I stand to condemn, in the strongest terms, the antisemitic vandalism and graffiti which defaced the Vietnam war memorial and the Korean War Memorial on Anzac Parade in our nation's capital recently. The vandalisation of the Vietnam and Korean war memorials with antisemitic slogans is disgraceful, it's appalling and it should be called out. These extremist protests dishonour our war dead and seek to divide us as a country. It's unacceptable and it's un-Australian. The coalition condemns this ugly behaviour and will continue to call it out as bad behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had the opportunity to speak with my RSL clubs, of which there are many across the electorate of Wright—through the Lockyer Valley, the Scenic Rim, Tamborine and Logan Village to the Gold Coast. In each of those communities we have war memorials. On those war memorials are the names of families who I live with, the names of families who I went to school with and the names of families of my neighbours whose relatives went and fought for the freedoms and liberties that we have and that we live by today. In each of our communities these memorials are unquestionably a place of reflection, a place of honour and a place of high significance. To think that anyone here in our country feels that they have the right to criminalise, use and weaponise these memorials for what they think may be a just cause is un-Australian.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One RSL branch chairman suggested that those Australians who break the law and graffiti our memorials should pack their bags and leave Australia if they don't like living here. That was just one comment from one. Other chairmen and presidents of the Returned and Services League weren't as charitable with their comments. I can inform the House that not one of my RSL presidents and not one of those persons across my broad community supported the acts. They stood with me to condemn the behaviour.</span>

Over 120 stakeholders attended, including community leaders, council members and MPs, highlighting the impact of these initiatives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another organisation that has been doing fantastic work in the community is the Peninsula Community Legal Centre. Peninsula Legal has been working to support those on temporary visas who are experiencing domestic violence. Often the victim's visa status and right to stay in Australia is dependent on their abusive partner, which traps them in a relationship as they're at risk of deportation. Peninsula legal provides these victims with free legal support and helps them to escape abusive relationships without risking their visa status. Recently I attended the launch of their new online tool. The tool aims to help workers with information about the family violence provisions in the migration framework and how victims can safely leave relationships and get migration assistance for their visa.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While these are two examples of organisations assisting refugees in my electorate, there are hundreds more. We, as the government, working with them, can ensure that refugees have a safe place to call home.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  One of the popular nightclubs in Fremantle, back in the day, when I was a young adult, was called Zanzibar. It's no longer there, but it was where Little Creatures is now. It was a really great nightclub where the music would be from the eighties and nineties and you'd dance your heart out until, I think, one o'clock in the morning. At midnight, every time, the song 'Love Shack' would come on. I remember one particular night when I was there with a close girlfriend and, as everyone was getting ready to leave and we were going down the stairs, this guy came up to her and basically held himself close against her. It was really gross, and she felt quite violated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember working in country Victoria, in Hamilton—I was there commissioning a mineral sands plant—and there was a great pub there. I remember standing around with a group of my colleagues, including a flocculant provider. We were standing around, and then this random man came up to us and—it was as if it was happening in slow motion—he came up to me, and it was like he was going to grab my breast. I didn't think that that was going to happen. It felt like it was happening in slow motion. I didn't think that he'd actually do it. And he did it. At that moment, Mr Pink, who was the flocculant provider, was kind of like, 'That is not on!' and arranged for him to get chucked out of the pub. Mr Pink broke his glasses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll also share another story, of Shanene, a woman who I met in my electorate of Swan. She's a Torres Strait Islander woman. She had this amazing, high-powered job, working for a local council. She fell in love and had this amazing relationship. They had this 12-month honeymoon period. Then I'd say that what started to happen was financial abuse, where he'd take her company credit card, or take her work car, and then he'd just continue taking. That was the first part of it. Then it started to escalate into physical violence. And sometimes he would come up to her workplace. Shanene ended up in a nine-month coma. She had to learn how to walk and talk again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when we talk about the elimination of violence against women, there is so much that we need to do. It's about speaking to our children. It's also about speaking to our peers and other adults. It's about challenging what happens in our workplaces as well. It's also about what we are doing as institutions and governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My kids and I have a routine in the morning. I always say to my kids: 'What time is it? Can you guess what I want?' and I stand there with arms open wide, waiting for a cuddle—and they don't have to give me a cuddle if they don't want to. One of the things I also do is, when my son wakes up, I ask him, 'Can I give you a kiss?' And this morning he was like, 'No.' I actually want to teach him the ability to say yes and no and to ask for consent. Consent is something that we can do time and time again. The behaviours that we teach our children are the foundations of how they will be when they become adults.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember listening to a radio interview where we heard about the release of doctored pornographic images of students. Most of the parents whose children were victims of this did not come out and speak to the media, and I understand. That would have been really challenging. There was one mother who came out, and the conversation that she had with her son was, 'Little girls don't grow up imagining being strangled during sexual intercourse.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is fascinating that strangulation is taking place more often in these intimate relationships. I don't think that it's something that people imagine doing. The statistics show that girls are more likely to be strangled compared to boys, and it's fascinating that this is what's happening to some of our teenagers and young adults. I think that we need to make sure that we have our eyes open and that we know some of the things that are happening in this community. We really need to give our teenagers the tools to know about consent and also know what good sexual relationships look like.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In one of my previous workplaces, we had an ex-CEO that would come and travel from interstate from time to time. One of the things he would do with the colleagues that had been around longer is give them a kiss. He would say, 'Hello! How are you going?' and you'd get a big kiss. One of my colleagues shared with me that she felt uncomfortable about that. After it happened a second time at a dinner, she made a point to say, 'I'd prefer not to kiss you.' And then another senior member of the management team was like, 'What? You don't want to kiss this guy? I'll kiss him instead,' and basically belittled her. It was interesting because later on I had a conversation with both of these blokes. I explained to the one who did the kissing that all that he needs to do in the first instance is ask for consent. The other one who trivialised what happened found it really challenging to understand what had happened and that he had not done the right thing. The thing that I'd say about workplaces is that I want people to challenge themselves to make sure that they are calling out these instances when they happen. Workplaces have a really important role to play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll talk about institutions and governments. I'm really proud that the 47th parliament is the most diverse parliament that we've ever had. I'm also proud that the Albanese Labor government has a majority-women caucus. What this means is that women's issues are on the forefront of our agenda. We are making sure that we are being really intentional with the way that we think about women and help women, particularly when it comes to domestic violence. For me, as a new member of parliament, I felt a real sense of privilege when we introduced the 10 days of domestic violence leave into the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms MASCARENHAS:</span>
                  </a>  I was explaining the opportunity for us as a community to act on violence against women, and it starts with talking with our children and our peers, looking at this in our workplaces and looking at what we can do on an institutional level. This year, 39 women have died due to violence against women. A staggering one in three women and girls have experienced violence since the age of 15. It's clear that this is a systemic issue. This is something that we'll continue to work on day after day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has come out of a national conversation that has been amplified this year. We saw the Me Too movement. There was quite a lot of conversation. We also saw what happened during the previous parliament as well. We are continuing to make sure the parliament has safer workplaces. It's great to see that the Albanese Labor government has made a record investment into this area, with an extra 500 frontline workers being funded. We're also ensuring that we have 4,000 homes for women and children fleeing domestic violence, and of course we have the 10 days of domestic violence leave which I spoke about earlier. Earlier this year, we talked about investing $2.3 billion into this area, and we've made further commitments since then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that I have been working on in a committee that I sit on—the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services—has been a look into financial abuse, because financial abuse is a form of coercive control and it is a window into an escalation of violence which can include physical or mental violence. Everybody has a role to play when we talk about the elimination of violence against women and girls, and I challenge everyone to play their part because we should be the country that eliminates it first.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:23</span>):  I rise to support the statement made by the Assistant Minister for Social Services and Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence, the Hon. Justine Elliot. Like, I would hope, every member of parliament, I share the very serious concerns that she has raised along with many others in government about the safety of women in our nation. This statement was made last year and, sadly, everything the assistant minister had to say at the time still rings tragically true today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been an especially tragic year for Australian women. We have seen it on the news. The grassroots group Counting Dead Women Australia have recorded that 39 women have been killed by acts of male violence just this year alone. These are women who have been killed by intimate partners—people who purported to have loved them. They have been found dead in their own homes, in places where they should have been safe. Tragically, for many women, we know that home is one of the deadliest places they can be. They have also been found dead in shopping centres, while going outside to take a run and get some exercise. Some have been found dead in their neighbour's house while they have sought help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a deeply disturbing matter for our nation and I reflect on the last woman who was killed, only four days ago, Sarah Miles. She is aged in her 40s, up in the Northern Rivers area, and she died of critical head injuries that were allegedly inflicted by her intimate partner, a person who had been in her life for a matter of only a few months. She was alive—unconscious but breathing—when the police arrived, but died before she could even get the help she needed. I actually don't have words to describe this anymore. 'Tragic' seems far too kind a word, almost. It is a catastrophic set of incidents that lead intimate partners in particular to end up violently killing the people that they purport to care about and love. It's unfathomable to many of us, but it is not something we can turn away from, as uncomfortable and devastating as it is for families. I know very few people that are actually untouched by the scourge of domestic, family and sexual violence. Many people in this House, if they have not had direct experience, have some lived experience via their families, friends, work colleagues or neighbours. It's not something any of us can or should turn away from, as uncomfortable as those truths are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If women are not safe, then that is not something that a nation can sweep under the carpet. Gone are the days when we didn't talk about domestic, family and sexual violence and that's a very good thing, but we know that it is still a big shame for lots of families. We have to do what we can in this place to ensure that we are elevating the issue, that we are doing everything we can as a government, and that we seek to bring all levels of government in all jurisdictions with us in making absolutely every effort, because we know violence can happen to women of any age, from every cultural and religious background—people of different jobs, different levels of education, different kinds of income-earning capacity, living in different areas and leading different lives. There are no discriminatory boundaries that domestic, family and sexual violence will ignore. It's prevalent everywhere, and it impacts us all. We know the stories, I shared the horrific one of Sarah Miles from just four days ago, but she is one of 39 women who have been killed by their intimate partners this year alone, and we have only just started July.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the type of world that we want for our girls to grow up in. We don't want them fearing for their lives or safety, and we don't want our boys to think that this is normal. We need this violence to stop and we need our culture, our behaviour and our attitudes towards women to change. Indeed, the way we think about masculinity and the growth and development of our boys in Australia needs to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each year in parliament, for the last 10 years, I have stood in this House to read the names of all those women who are killed by acts of violence in Australia. It is one of the toughest speeches I give in this House, and it is always shockingly too long. Last year there were 64 women killed by acts of violence in Australia. According to the numbers now, in the early days of July—as I said, 39—we are set to, tragically, exceed that number in 2024. It's not a speech I look forward to delivering at all. The ABS data says that one in four women have experienced violence from an intimate partner since the age of 15. The same source tells us that that violence is seldom isolated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government have set ourselves a goal of ending violence against women and children within a generation. A lot of people told us we were crazy, setting ourselves up for failure, and I don't dispute for one moment that this is an ambitious target, but I tell you what: it's not one that any of us can afford not to achieve. I don't want this government, or any government after us, to lower their ambition, to somehow think that we don't need to act with a great sense of urgency, commitment and determination to end violence against women and children within a generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that gender inequality is one of the driving forces of violence against women. That is why we've released our <span style="font-style:italic;">Working for </span><span style="font-style:italic;">women</span>, a 10-year national strategy to achieve gender equality. Addressing gender based violence is priority area No. 1. Those actions have been well mapped out by our respective ministers. Indeed, I've made speeches in this parliament as well. There is a big number—$3.4 billion—attached to supporting women's safety. That may be an eye-watering amount when you just talk about money, but we should talk about what that means on the ground, because that is a little bit more useful for people. It will mean improved justice responses, for example, to sexual violence. We're funding that ALRC inquiry to examine what more we can do. We're improving our reporting and data collection so that we've got a better understanding of domestic and family violence, and boosting response times and victim-survivor experiences. We've made the family law system safer and simpler for families and children, and we're the first government ever to legislate 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave. The budget also provided a lot of other measures, including the Leaving Violence Program, delivering $5,000 of upfront support for women when they need it most. And there are many more programs that will be rolled out over the coming year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My greatest wish is that one year I won't have to stand in this parliament to recite the names of women killed by acts of male violence in Australia. That would be when we could say in this place that we've done what we need to do as governments. We should all recommit ourselves to ending violence against women and children now and forever.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  As the member for Lindsay, I have a set of statistics I'm not proud of. The Nepean Police Area Command has stations in Penrith and St Marys in my electorate, and they have some of the highest rates of domestic and family violence in New South Wales. We need to do better as a community. This is a multipartisan effort. Every conversation and intervention will help break these terrible statistics that relate to real-life circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Penrith Women's Health Centre is an incredible local organisation that assists hundreds and hundreds of local families each year. But a few weeks ago their CEO wrote to me about a nonrenewal of funding by the Albanese Labor government. This meant that last Friday, the last business day of the financial year, a part-time caseworker was going to be let go from the centre. Further, we learnt last week that this could mean a reduction of casework been taken on by the centre by 30 per cent—30 per cent less casework for women escaping domestic violence. This is not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote to the Minister for Social Services and the Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence, pushing them to put money back on the table for the Penrith Women's Health Centre. There are so many vulnerable women across the Western Sydney community that the centre supports. They operate across the Penrith, Hawkesbury and Blue Mountains areas and need to be adequately funded to do their vital work. The centre provides food support and programs to assist young women as well. The caseworkers are constantly helping those experiencing the pain of partner trauma, whether that be a young mum in a difficult situation with a new partner, a family that has endured years of abuse or an elderly woman who is scared to leave, because she just doesn't have the finances to support herself. These are the stories that we keep hearing time and time again. It is what the Penrith Women's Health Centre helps to combat every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank our opposition spokesperson for countering family and domestic violence, Senator Kerrynne Liddle, for her enormous work in this space and for meeting with the Penrith Women's Health Centre as well. I know Senator Liddle made representations to the minister. I also made a contribution in the House last week, highlighting the need for funding to be restored. Funding for the MUSTER program that I campaigned for at the 2019 election and secured for the Penrith Women's Health Centre was the funding that was going to be taken away. But, finally, at the eleventh hour, with a lot of pushing and advocacy, the centre had good news. It was confirmed with state government officials that they had been successful for further funding by the Commonwealth. This funding included one full-time qualified worker and one trainee position until 20 June 2026.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing is, we shouldn't have to fight down to the wire for funding for domestic violence services or have the threat of losing a staff member before finally being listened to. We have an announcement by the Labor government of these 500 new, frontline domestic violence workers, but it's only slow in its delivery. We need to act quicker. The government needs to act quicker. And I wonder if the positions allocated to the Penrith Women's Health Centre will be ticked off as new positions for the government or if the data will reflect that it's actually a partial increase in casework support, given they were going to cut a position. I really hope politics isn't played with this very valuable organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By 30 June 2023, 200 new workers were meant to be helping across Australian neighbourhoods and regional areas. However, none had been delivered by that time. The target number by 30 June 2024 to have begun work in the community was 352 positions. Unfortunately, the data reflects that, by this time, only 94 had been contracted. From the numbers released just a few days ago, there has been no advancement in employing those 500 frontline workers in Victoria, Tasmania or the ACT since the last reporting period. Local organisations that do their utmost to support women in crisis should not have to wait. They should not have to be on tenterhooks to know what their future is. There is a serious problem with this program if the government thinks it's okay for such vital services to be told the day before letting someone go that that person can keep their job. In my time as the shadow assistant minister for mental health and suicide prevention, I remember speaking to many organisations about the struggles they faced with government funding lapsing periods and not knowing if programs were going to receive the needed money. This needs to stop for vital support services across the country. They need certainty, and I encourage and urge the Labor government to deliver this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this discussion on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Woman, we need a stronger, overarching approach to combating family and domestic violence in every single suburb and town across the country. As I said, my particular electorate has higher statistics than most, and it is something that I work very hard every day to eliminate. But, as we all say in this place, more needs to be done. One of the things that we have control over is the allocation of funding for these grassroots organisations that mean so much to women in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that the Albanese Labor government revises the model to ensure greater take-up of the program for the 500 frontline services, that they make sure that these are new positions and not simply positions given back to organisations after taking away support, and that they really put a focus on prioritising these positions, because these positions are actual people on the ground supporting those most in need. The Australian families facing domestic violence expect no less.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:40</span>):  I rise to speak in continuation on the 16th anniversary of the National Apology to the Stolen Generations and the <span style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">losing the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ap</span> annual report. In the first part of my speech, I reflected on the power of then prime minister Kevin Rudd's 2008 national apology to Australia's First Nations people whose lives had been completely turned upside down by past government policies of that forced child removal and assimilation. Primarily, it was an apology on behalf of the nation to those stolen generations. I reflected on the extraordinary life of the late Dr Lowitja O'Donoghue, who was a trailblazing Aboriginal woman and leader who herself was stolen from her family at the age of just two and raised in a mission home devoid of love and her family life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we are, 16 years after the apology, and only 11 out of 19 socioeconomic outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are improving. Indicators around life expectancy, children's health, education, youth employment, housing and the maintenance of culture and economic relationships with land are improving, but they are still not there. Just four are on track to meet their targets. This is completely unacceptable. Tragically, outcomes have worsened for children's early development, rates of children in out-of-home care, rates of adult imprisonment and suicide. Put simply, there is so much work to be done in order to close the gap. That is not dissimilar to the speech I gave a little earlier. Each year, I have stood in this parliament to report on or to respond to the report about how we're going on closing the gap. No-one thinks that this is something to be turned around overnight, but the previous 10 years of inaction mean that we really have got to accelerate the efforts that we make, and I know the government is seeking to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just seven years ago at Uluru, Aboriginal people called for a voice to parliament to be seated at the table for matters that concern them, and last year we put that question to the people of Australia. Sadly, it was not supported, for a whole lot of complicated reasons that I won't have time to go into today, but what we do know is that Aboriginal people supported it. So there is a desperate appetite to be part of decision-making processes and design processes for what governments of all levels in all jurisdictions might do in terms of working to close the gap. Our resolve is not diminished by the unsuccessful referendum, but we are absolutely making sure that First Nations people continue to have a voice, even if it's not in the form that was put during that referendum process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also announced the establishment of a national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's commission, a new office that will protect and promote the rights of children. That will play a very important role in the work of this government going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot more to do in terms of employment and education. There have been some great announcements, particularly in the Northern Territory, and I acknowledge your advocacy in that regard, Deputy Speaker Scrymgour, ensuring there are improvements for housing, employment and the justice reinvestment programs that this government is keen to see rolled out, making sure that we have genuine partnerships with those communities most impacted and most affected. As the Prime Minister said, if we want to close the gap, we have to listen to the people who live on the other side of it, and that is exactly what we will be doing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  I'm so very pleased that you are in the chair for my contribution, Deputy Speaker Scrymgour, member for Lingiari, because I have so much respect for you and for the positions that you take on matters pertaining not just to Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander peoples but to all Australians. I know the importance of having Lingiari as its own electorate, because there was a time in the last term when the Australian Electoral Commission wanted to make the Northern Territory one seat. Even the AEC map and website included the seats of Solomon and Lingiari as one seat—the Northern Territory seat—going forward. This is something that I spoke up passionately about. I wrote an op-ed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">NT</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ews</span> about it, and they ended up running it on the front page as well as inside that day's edition. It is just not right for people, particularly Aboriginal people, in such a sprawling electorate as Lingiari—one of the largest in Australia and one of the largest political divisions in the world—to be combined with a capital city electorate and for us to expect people to get representation. You are nodding, Deputy Speaker, and I know you are a good member. I know that this is important for the Northern Territory. I'm glad that we have enshrined in legislation the fact that the Northern Territory has to have two electorates, because it's too big not to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am all for 'one vote, one value', but even in the AEC's latest New South Wales redistribution the electorate of Parkes—and the member for Parkes, Mark Coulton, has represented that electorate for 17 or so years since 2007—is such a massive land mass. Just from the Riverina electorate, the new Parkes boundaries will take in the Bland LGA—centred on West Wyalong—and the Forbes and Parkes local government areas. It makes it so difficult for someone to represent interests, when you consider that you could put your handkerchief over some of these city electorates, whereas members for Parkes and Lingiari and, dare I say, Riverina—and my good friend the member for Flynn—spend much of our time behind the wheel of a car or in the passenger seat doing the work that we need to do to get around our vast electorates, which are equal if not larger in size than many European countries. It's not right. It's not right for the constituents, particularly in this case, as we talk about the important issue of closing the gap. It's not fair on those Indigenous Australians who need to see their local member of parliament as much as anyone. It's not fair on the member trying to get around those huge landmasses and give the representation required.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are on Ngunnawal and Ngambri territory at the moment, and I respect that. My Riverina electorate boundaries, as they currently stand, are entirely encompassed by Wiradjuri people. Wiradjuri is one of the largest nations in Australia, and they are a proud people—a good people. The new electorate will have Ngarigo peoples in Tumut-Tumbarumba and Ngunnawal country in Yass and Murrumbateman. I respect the fact that the boundaries are changing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The name of the city of Wagga Wagga was derived from the language of the Wiradjuri people. It's the largest Aboriginal nation in New South Wales. The word 'wagga wagga' for many years was considered to mean 'place of many crows'. The repetition of a word expresses plural or emphasis. In more recent times, they've adopted the word 'waga', which means a place to dance and celebrate and to come together and have those large celebrations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say that one of the most impressive local events that I ever went to, organised by Joe Williams, Geoff Simpson and a few others, was a corroboree down at the Murrumbidgee River. 'Murrumbidgee' is an Aboriginal word meaning 'deep water' or 'big river'. What the Wagga Wagga City Council has done—in conjunction, I must proudly say, with federal funding—is develop the riverside precinct down to the Wiradjuri reserve to tell the story. They've got a yarning circle. They've got places there where they've got interpretive signage, where our Aboriginal history is laid out, and that is good. That is commendable because our younger generations need to know that this is so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Wollundry Lagoon precinct in 2018 there was a Sorry Day rock unveiled, and that commemorates the children sent to the Cootamundra girls home and the Kinchela boys home, where they were taught farm labour and domestic work. Of course, 16 years ago, the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, issued the famous apology. It was sadly necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that this parliament does everything it can to address the Closing the Gap issues. They are particularly heightened in regional areas, and none more so than in remote areas as far as dental health and mental health are concerned. It is not right that the health services of Indigenous Australians are lesser than those in metropolitan areas. If ever we needed to close the gap, it is in those areas—maternal health and all of those areas of health. I know I don't need to tell you this, Deputy Speaker Scrymgour, and I'm certainly not trying to, but those people in Tennant Creek, Katherine and Alice Springs do it tough. I've visited those areas many times. It was quite an eye-opener for my wife, Catherine, when we visited Tennant Creek to listen to local people. But we need to do more to address these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As long as I've got breath in me and as long as I'm in this place, I will fight hard for an aquatics centre for Mornington Island. It's in the electorate of Kennedy. It's certainly a long way from the Riverina. I appreciate that they say all politics is local. But I visited there. It was one of the last things I did as Acting Prime Minister in the golden age of Australian democracy, as I often tongue-in-cheek refer to it as. I met people like Kyle Yanner, the mayor of Mornington shire, taking in Mornington Island. That population of 1,200 or so does not have a swimming pool and does not have an aquatics centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their island is surrounded by the Torres Strait. It's in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Their island is surrounded by crocodile infested waters. They are beautiful people. They are a wonderful community. They're doing what they can. They're also a very young community, and yet they don't have a swimming pool. I think it's incumbent upon this place. I have urged the infrastructure minister, the member for Ballarat, to do what she can. Of course, she needs an application for one of those regional grant programs to build that particular facility, but I will continue to advocate it because I promised the mayor that that is what I would do. I want to see it delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about closing the gap. It's all well and good for us all to get up here and talk about all those noble gestures and to do the welcomes to country and all that, but it's also more importantly about providing real and genuine and tangible help to Indigenous people where they need it most. That is in the sorts of health services that they need—in Forbes, in Cowra and in other places where there is a high proportion of Aboriginal people. It's in those remote communities in far western New South Wales, in remote South Australia, in your part of the world Deputy Speaker Scrymgour, in Western Australia and in Queensland, in the outer regions. And it's about providing the necessary infrastructure in places such as Mornington Island, because it is needed and it is now expected, because I gave them my word I would do it. It's also deserved. Why shouldn't they have an aquatic centre? It makes no sense that they don't.</span>

                  <a href="83M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment and Water</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  by leave—Originally I spoke more about the apology, but, since that time in February, I want to update the House on some additional measures we've made in the Environment and Water portfolio that add to our efforts to close the gap. No-one knows our land and seas better than First Nations people, who have more than 65,000 years of experience in caring for country. As the Minister for the Environment and Water, I have learned so much from First Nations people, but there is so much more to do to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the more than two years that I've been the Minister for the Environment and Water, we've been making real progress in our Commonwealth efforts on the Closing the Gap Implementation Plan. I want to begin with a few words on what we've done in the Water portfolio. The Albanese Labor government is delivering the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full. As part of that, we're making sure that the voices and values of First Nations people are heard. Last month, on 22 June, we launched a world-leading water ownership program for First Nations people in the Murray-Darling Basin, delivering an election commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Aboriginal Water Entitlements Program, the government has made $100 million available to buy water in the basin, with First Nations representatives to determine how that money is spent. The program has been developed in close partnership with First Nations representatives from across the basin to ensure that it supports the cultural, economic, social and environmental needs of First Nations people. The program was announced first in 2018, with a $40 million commitment from the former government. That money was never spent. The Albanese Labor government has turned this around, increasing the program's funding to $100 million as part of a broader effort to strengthen the Water Amendment (Restoring Our Rivers) Act 2023. First Nations communities have cared for Murray-Darling Basin rivers for thousands of years but have largely, to date, been excluded from managing and owning water. The Albanese Labor government's $100 million Aboriginal Water Entitlements Program begins to reverse that legacy and recognises the lasting and deep connection of First Nations people with water. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aboriginal Water Entitlements Program will contribute directly to a national inland waters target, being developed under the National Agreement on Closing the Gap. This target is intended to increase the level of ownership of inland water access entitlements by First Nations organisations across the country. First Nations Australians own and control less than 0.2 per cent of our surface water entitlements. We're now working with the states to increase ownership and control with First Nations people. My department has reinstated the Inland Waters Target Working Group. The working group has delegates from each state and territory jurisdiction, with membership also including the Coalition of Peaks, the Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Water Interests and the National Indigenous Australians Agency. I expect it won't be too long before the inland waters target will be formally added to the national agreement. But our government's progress on the Aboriginal Water Entitlements Program demonstrates that I'm already taking action to increase water ownership and the economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits that come from that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our work on water ownership is complemented by the $150 million commitment to regional and remote First Nations water supplies. This contributes to the Closing the Gap target of providing essential services by delivering safe and reliable water in First Nations communities. Poor water security of both quality and supply of course has negative impacts on health and wellbeing. This is another area that when we came into government had not received the attention that it deserved. We've addressed this area as a matter of urgency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $150 million commitment is providing safe and reliable drinking water that meets those fundamental health, wellbeing and overall quality-of-life outcomes that we want for all Australians. Improved water infrastructure can support economic growth. It can create opportunities for local employment, education and training along with cultural tourism and opportunities for improved health services delivered on country. Of course, very importantly, you can't build more housing if you don't have adequate water supply in towns, so improving water supplies in remote communities allows the building of additional housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has already allocated $75.9 million of the initial $150 million investment, and the bulk of those projects are already underway. I won't go through the whole list of them, but here are just a few examples: $13 million is being provided for Maningrida, on the central Arnhem coast in the Northern Territory. The project will include a new water tank to expand storage capacity alongside pipes that connect the network. More than 90 per cent of those pipes in Maningrida have already been made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example is in Milingimbi, off the coast of Arnhem Land. The Australian and Northern Territory governments are investing $11 million to improve access to reliable water sources. That investment will find new bores for that community. It's very obvious what that means for improvements in drinking water. It's obvious what it means for being able to provide remote dialysis in communities that previously haven't had it. Milingimbi is a good example of what it does for social impact beyond water. The investment in water has meant that 32 existing homes can be expanded and another 32 homes can be added to the community, thus helping us close the gap on housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's still more work to be done on housing to meet the target, but progress of course is tracking in the right direction. Nationally in 2021, 81.4 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were living in appropriately sized—that is, not overcrowded—housing, up from 78.9 per cent in 2016.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area where we've been making very important progress towards the Closing the Gap targets is in the Indigenous Protected Areas program. The Indigenous Protected Areas program is jointly managed by my department and the National Indigenous Australians Agency. The IPA provides a recognised framework for First Nations communities to combine traditional and contemporary knowledge to manage their land and sea country and provide employment, education and training opportunities for First Nations people. The Australian government is investing $231½ million over five years to continue to expand the IPA program. IPA delivers environmental, cultural and social and economic benefits that follow an agreed plan. The plans include cultural site management, threatened species monitoring and protection, habitat restoration, biodiversity surveys, marine debris removal, weed and pest animal management, fire management, tourism and visitor management, and education, including cross-generational knowledge sharing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know IPAs are important for regional and remote development, particularly increasing employment for First Nations people. Continuing to invest in these programs and expand the IPA program is having a terrific positive impact in the Closing the Gap work. The IPA program draws on First Nations knowledge and expertise to better protect and conserve Australia's environment. They're better for the environment, better for local jobs and better for local culture. Last year, we expanded the IPA program with another $14½ million to add 10 more IPAs across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wanted to mention the extra investment in the very successful Indigenous Rangers Program. We're investing $1.3 billion to support the ranger program, including another $359 million to double the number of Indigenous rangers from 1,900 to 3,800 to help manage feral animals and weeds, support threatened species and better manage our land and sea country. One of the best things about the Indigenous Rangers Program is that it provides terrific work for people, including in very remote parts of Australia, and that money that goes with those jobs stays in those communities and generates even more employment for people who are working in those communities and other roles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our work on cultural heritage law reform is also proceeding. We're working very closely with the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance and other stakeholders to strengthen our cultural heritage laws so we'll never again see a repeat of what happened in Juukan Gorge. The current partnership agreement with the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance is being extended with a new agreement for an extended partnership. As a report on Closing the Gap states, 'The gap is not a natural phenomenon.' We will do our best in the environment and water portfolios to put that gap behind us.</span>
              </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  A sickening number of gendered violence incidents and deaths have been dominating our headlines in 2024. To stave off despair about this national scourge, I wanted to take a few minutes to look at the positive inclusions in this year's budget that are directed towards women. I do this with the acknowledgement that there is still a lot of work to do and that no one federal budget can resolve every social issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming into office only two years ago, the Albanese Labor government has been focused on putting women and gender equality front and centre of Australia's economic plan. This government is determined to make women's lives safer, fairer and more equal. Labor leads by example, and I'm proud that the Labor Party in this 47th Parliament is 53 per cent women. As I'm sure you would attest, Deputy Speaker Andrews, you can't be what you can't see—that goes for young women. Can I say that you have personally been quite the inspiration to your community, Deputy Speaker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a Labor government, under the late, great Bob Hawke, that first introduced the Women's Budget Statement—a world first. Our now-restored Women's Budget Statement speaks to the key aims and values of the Albanese Labor government. It focuses on education and employment, respect at work and equal pay, and measures to keep women and children safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To put this year's Women's Budget Statement in context, earlier this year Labor launched the first national strategy to achieve gender equality. Working for Women: A Strategy for Gender Equality is a 10-year plan with the vision of a nation where people are safe, treated with respect, have choices and have access to resources and equal outcomes no matter what their gender. The strategy has five priority areas for action: (1) gendered violence; (2) unpaid and paid care; (3) economic equality and security; (4) health; and (5) leadership. Our Labor budget focuses on these five key areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently in this chamber I spoke on gendered violence. I was also fortunate to have the opportunity a few weeks ago to listen to Jess Hill and Michael Salter talk about their work 'Rethinking primary prevention'. A key focus of their recommendations is on working to prevent gendered violence, including stopping perpetrators from reoffending. They are driving the conversation about regulation for industries such as alcohol, pornography and gambling, all of which are known to exacerbate gendered violence. Jess and Michael also talked about combating the effects of intergenerational trauma, child neglect and child abuse for both potential perpetrators and potential victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is investing $1.3 million over two years to undertake a rapid review of evidence based approaches to preventing gender based violence. The expert panel, including Jess Hill, will provide practical advice to government on further action, including a focus on high-risk perpetrators: those people who turn up in front of magistrates time after time after time—often, in a world of misery. Diverting them down a more sensible path earlier, before they reach that valley of tears, and worse, is a fine thing to attempt to do. The review's first report is due in the third quarter of this year. The budget also set aside $4.3 million for Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety to further investigate and establish the evidence base on both the drivers of and recovery from the perpetration of gendered violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our approach to taking action on gendered violence is not just about research; it's about actual, tangible, on-the-ground support as well. We've directed over $925 million over five years to permanently establish the Leaving Violence Program. Eligible victims-survivors will be able to access up to $5,000 in financial support to help them leave, as well as receiving assistance with referral services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further financial help is available with the back-to-back boost to Commonwealth rent assistance, as well as the expanded eligibility for parenting payment single. We are also backing this up with further measures on social housing and homelessness. We've negotiated the $9.3 billion national agreement with the states and territories, and we're also directing a $1 billion increase in funding for crisis and transitional accommodation for women, children and youth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is also focused on improving the experience of women on university campuses across the country. We're developing a national higher education code to prevent and respond to gender based violence. This will require universities to strengthen their accountability. We're also establishing a national student ombudsman—an office to provide support for students for a range of complaints about their higher education provider, including those related to sexual harassment and violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also note Labor's reform of paid parental leave to include superannuation. That kicks off on 1 July 2025. Taking time out to care for children is a normal part of working life for both parents. Paying super on paid parental leave will normalise parental leave as a workplace entitlement, encourage more equal sharing of care, show that our society values the carer role and ensure that more women can access a dignified retirement. Paying super on government paid parental leave is a key step in prioritising gender equality. It's a crucial investment to close the super gap, which affects women's retirement income significantly. This super gap currently sits at around 25 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This reform builds on Labor's historic investment in Australia's paid parental leave. We've already made it easier for both parents to access and share care, and our legislation means we'll have added an extra six weeks by 2026. Since Monday, families have had access to two extra weeks of leave. This will increase until the scheme reaches 26 weeks by July 2026.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget also focuses on the care economy and the paid care work that women—overwhelmingly women—do on top of their unpaid work. I'm talking about the aged-care workers and early childhood educators, who will all be receiving wage increases to recognise the importance of their work. It's a sad reflection that these roles are often undervalued and underpaid. Since 1 July, we've taken some steps towards changing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're working on changing the perception of both unpaid and paid care work. We're making the carer payment more flexible, so that recipients—mainly women—can do paid work, study or volunteering. We're further supporting eligible nursing, midwifery, teaching and social work students—who are, predominantly, women—with a prac support payment. That's over $427 million to enable those students to undertake mandatory prac placements and bolster the number of people entering these in-demand professions. We made a further 400,000 places available in our fee-free TAFE scheme, with women making up 60 per cent of those enrolments. All these measures go toward improved economic equality and security for women. Monday's cost-of-living tax cuts provide greater relief for low- and middle-income taxpayers, a group—not surprisingly—disproportionately made up of women. All 6.5 million women taxpayers will receive that tax cut this year, with an average annual benefit of around $1,650. This will ease the pressure on household budgets, along with that $300 energy rebate for every household. Labor has also resolved the issue with indexation to help fees, wiping around $3 billion in debt and ensuring that future indexation to HELP is at the rate of the lower of either the consumer price index or the wage price index. This will directly benefit women, who hold the majority of HELP debts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget includes more than $160 million directly targeted at women's health supports. We've added crucial breast cancer treatment medicines to the PBS and reduced the cost of the medicine from $97,000 per course to a maximum of only $31.60 per script. Labor is establishing endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics across Australia—clinics that will provide multidisciplinary care and enable more appropriate and more timely diagnosis and management. Endometriosis is a debilitating chronic condition that affects one in nine girls and women in Australia. These clinics will ensure improved pain management for sufferers. There is also funding to support high-quality maternity care, support for women who have suffered miscarriage, and free period products supplied by the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we have focused on setting women up for future jobs for a future made in Australia and more leadership opportunities. There is $38 million over eight years to bolster the STEM workforce. We are also launching the Building Women's Careers Program. We established the Working for Women Program to support the drive for gender equality. Part of this will have government boards that have 50 per cent representation of women and will make sure that half of the chairs and deputy chairs are women also. We are focusing on collecting data and improving things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians know there is still work to do on gender equality—the newspaper headlines tell us this every day. We are in the midst of a national crisis in gendered violence, but we will keep working at it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  Budget No. 3 from the Treasurer is very consistent—big on political spin, short on actually delivering for the community. It's almost like Doctor Chalmers' PhD was focused on politics and was focused on the former leader of the ALP Paul Keating, because that's what he is focused on—political spin. He spent his life working in this House as a staffer and as member for parliament. He talks about being in 18 budget lock-ups like it's something that is a great thing for the Australian people. But what it has done is it has allowed him to understand the mechanisms of the budget and how you can make things appear like they are doing one thing when they are actually not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no greater example of this Treasurer's spin than the $300 energy bill rebate and his continual line that it will bring inflation down. There are two parts to this spin, but let's be really clear: in a cost-of-living, every dollar that the Australian people can get is needed. The first part of political spin from the Treasurer and those opposite and the Prime Minister is that they've said this week you'll get $300 from today. Well, you'll get $300 over 12 months—you'll get $75 a quarter. They could at least be a little bit honest about that. Anyone who has received their power bill recently will know that $75 a quarter is not covering much of that bill. I had many residents reach out to me about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of the spin—and this is the much more important part in terms of the impact it will have on the Australian people, which he doesn't want to talk about it—is he talks about how it's going to bring inflation down. But it is not. What it is going to do—and even the RBA June board meeting notes say this—is it will temporarily reduce headline inflation. It will artificially and temporarily bring that inflation number down, but it's not actually going to treat the symptoms. It's actually not even treating the cause. There's a reason he wants to bring the headline inflation down, and it's pure politics. The headline inflation number is the one that many in the media report on and talk about. It is the two to three per cent band that everyone talks about the RBA aiming to get to. But it's actually not the key measure that the RBA use. They use many other factors, including the trimmed mean inflation, which is a much more realistic number. So this is what this Treasurer is trying to do as I stand here in July 2024—and let's review this in a few months time, at the end of the year. He is trying to temporarily and artificially bring the headline inflation down so the articles in the papers will say that it's within the band.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then those opposite—not the Treasurer himself, because he's smart enough to know that he can't verbal the RBA governor—will start to put pressure on the RBA governor to bring interest rates down. Then, when the RBA governor doesn't do that—because, as we saw last week, inflation has just picked up from 3.6 to four per cent—those opposite will start to blame the governor for interest rates not coming down. That is the cynical political ploy that this Treasurer and this Prime Minister are undertaking. Let's see how that goes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately for the Australian people, even that political ploy is unlikely to work, because, as we saw last week, inflation is ticking up because, as the RBA's internal notes say, the government are running an expansionary budget. They are running an expansionary government when inflation is above the target band, when they should be running a contractionary budget. The government's decisions are driving inflation higher. If we see an interest rate rise—as many are predicting for August or September—be under no illusion: that interest rate rise is because of the decisions and the economic mismanagement of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer of this country. But all the Treasurer has got is the political spin of trying to get a temporary reduction in the headline inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just at the national level that this budget lets down the Australian people. My electorate of Casey is 2½ thousand square kilometres, and we don't have an emergency department within our community. It's very hard to get access to a doctor. Earlier this year, the Prime Minister in question time talked about adding 29 new urgent care clinics in the next budget. He announced them in the budget. I've been working with my community. I've been campaigning to get an urgent care clinic into our community. We need a place where the community can go to get that support because, as I said, it is 2½ thousand square kilometres, and most of my community have to drive 30 or 40 minutes or even an hour to get to an emergency department. So I've been watching with interest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been campaigning for this. We've written to the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance. They're aware of the campaign. The finance minister referenced it in Senate estimates, so they're aware of it. We've now had the announcement of 29 urgent care clinics. Ten have been launched and slowly dripped out to get the media headlines. I've watched with interest where those locations are. Out of the 10 that have been announced since the budget, eight of the locations are within Labor electorates. Eighty per cent are within Labor electorates—shock, horror! Another one is an Independent seat that was a Labor seat, which they're looking to get back. And then there was one in a Liberal seat. It seems that there is a very strong political element to the allocation of those. That's 10 out of 29, so we're a third of the way through. You would think that something like health and access to emergency departments would be above politics. I'll continue to work with my community to run our campaign calling for an urgent care clinic in Casey. I thank those who have added their names to the petition, added their support to show how much this is needed. I'll watch with interest as more sites continue to roll out, and we'll see what happens with the political breakdown of those.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons my community needs an urgent care clinic is that it's harder and harder to get to a doctor. We don't have an emergency department, and it's harder and harder to get access to a GP. We only have seven bulk-billing clinics in the community. What this government doesn't like to talk about with bulk-billing rates is that, since they came to government, bulk-billing rates across the country, including in Casey, have actually declined. That's the awkward fact that they don't like to talk about. But we also know that there's an expectation that there will be a shortage of around 11,000 GPs by 2031. And there's more we need to do. I speak to and visit many of my GPs, and they're struggling to get new GPs to be able to fit in more patients. Many GPs are having to forego their lunch break just to try and see extra people that are calling up wanting to get a place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I'm really proud to be part of a coalition that committed to investing $400 million to provide junior doctors who train in general practice with incentive payments, assistance with leave entitlements and support for vocational training. This is an investment that will help close that gap and that will help get more young doctors to become GPs and to move, particularly, into regional, rural and peri-urban areas. In my community, it's quite a challenging situation, where they can't get access to their GPs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget, we also saw that the government were completely silent on productivity. Productivity is crucial to our economic growth as a country. Since those opposite came to power, productivity has dropped 5.2 per cent. The reality is that to bring inflation down and actually treat the cause, not the symptoms, you need to drive productivity growth, because that means employers can continue to pay their employees more, which is a good thing. But they offset that increased cost by greater output—greater productivity—which brings the unit cost of that good or that service down, which means people can get paid more and the businesses, particularly small and family businesses, can remain profitable, which is crucial when they invest their own capital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final price that consumers pay doesn't need to go up. But this government—this Treasurer and this Prime Minister—are silent on productivity because they can't treat the cause. It is political spin to try and show that they're making a difference, but the Australian people know they're not.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWA" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RISHWORTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  I'm very pleased to speak on the budget papers today because the budget that the Treasurer handed down very recently is a budget that supports people with cost-of-living pressures now and sets our country up for the future. It is a positive plan that is about investing now and in tomorrow. I am pleased that there is not only significant support that we are delivering through my Social Services portfolio but also, importantly, initiatives that support the people in the southern suburbs of Adelaide in the electorate of Kingston, which I represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are many benefits that will flow, as a result of this budget, to my seat. We just heard the member for Casey speak so glowingly about the urgent care clinics, and I could not reinforce his comments enough. These are a successful initiative of this government. Just to highlight the success, in Morphett Vale the urgent care clinic has been visited by 6,014 people. Expanding this really successful program in this budget is going to deliver more help for people when they need it—it might be for a fracture or something that isn't as significant as to need acute emergency care. But, at the moment, as a result of the neglect by those opposite, we do not have an appropriately functioning primary care system. These urgent care clinics have been well developed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is on top of getting back to fixing Medicare, which the health minister has been doing—including in the last budget, where the bulk-billing incentive was tripled. It has not just been primary care that's been a focus of this government. It has also been about making medicines cheaper. This was fiercely opposed by those opposite, but, just to put it in perspective: residents in Kingston have already saved over $1.7 million. That is money that's in the pockets of my local residents. It is a measure that those opposite opposed. Of course, importantly, in this budget prices of PBS medicines are frozen for general patients for a year, and for concession card holders frozen at $7.70 for five years. This is a significant saving and makes sure that some of that cost-of-living pressure is taken off when it comes to buying medicine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this, we are seeing a big investment in TAFE. I have seen firsthand already what fee-free TAFE had done at Noarlunga, and I've spoken about that in this place many times before. It has allowed people that had never considered vocational education, or had thought getting it was out of reach, to take the leap. It has also revitalised the Noarlunga TAFE campus, a TAFE campus that had been mothballed. Fee-free TAFE has re-enlivened it. Now within this budget there is extra funding, with $88.8 million to provide additional fee-free TAFE places, allowing more people in the southern suburbs of Adelaide and indeed right around the country to get the benefit of fee-free TAFE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also we've seen in this budget new infrastructure spending and, importantly, an investment in local roads. When I am having my street corner meetings and shopping centre stalls, the condition of local roads often comes up. I'm really proud of being part of a government that is willing to partner with state and local governments to actually deliver projects—not just put out a press release, say you're going to fund something and then never back it up, because you don't have a partner in it. We're partnering with local councils and local government. In my local area, that will mean a significant investment of over $30 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate another 10,395 people are now eligible for the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program, in an age range between 45 to 50. This is incredibly important and something that's really welcomed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in this area I wanted to talk about the extension of Local Sporting Champions. This is a really important program and one I'm very proud to support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have left: in the portfolio of social services we've taken a deliberate approach to support people with the cost of living. I would like to highlight, firstly, that we have committed to a further 10 per cent increase in the maximum rates of rent assistance. This is incredibly important and builds on our measures from the last budget. The benefit of this is not just directly for those people receiving it; it has actually worked, according to the ABS, to moderate rent across the spectrum. Of course, we want to see those rental rate increases moderated again, but this is a sensible matter. I would like to point out that, since our government was elected in May 2022, the maximum rates of Commonwealth rent assistance have increased by 42 per cent when combined with indexation and our base rate increases. That's a really important investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've made changes to carers participation rules. These are really important for the 2.65 million unpaid carers, ensuring that if they want to work, study or volunteer they can do so more flexibly. We will be doing that by changing the 25-hour participation rule to allow for 100 hours over four weeks, as well as removing restrictions on studying and volunteering activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The partial capacity to work changes that are in front of the Senate ensure that the higher rate of JobSeeker is extended to single recipients who have a partial capacity to work under 15 hours, with a recognition that those people face more barriers. Importantly, we have also chosen to freeze the social security deeming rates for a further 12 months to 30 June 2025. This means that over 870,000 current income support recipients, including 450,000 age pensioners, will be able to keep more of what they earn on their investments without affecting their pension.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On women's safety, we have made a significant investment in this budget, building on the investments we have made in previous budgets, particularly by establishing permanently the Leaving Violence Program. This program is incredibly important. Since becoming minister, I've been doing a lot of work to ensure that this program is fit for purpose. It is much more than just a financial support. That is a critical part of it, but it also is incredibly important for the casework, the referral work and also the risk assessment work that is done in this program. I am so pleased that we will make this a permanent feature to support women leaving domestic violence circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of disability, I am really pleased that, in this budget, we've announced that, from 1 July 2025, we will replace the current Disability Employment Services with a fit-for-purpose, specialised disability employment service. This really is an important program. It is important that people with a disability get the opportunity to participate in work and get the opportunities that many of us take for granted. We will ensure that our new program is inclusive but, importantly, is of high quality. When I became minister, I couldn't believe that the DES program did not measure clients' experience—the experience that people at the heart of the system had. So quality will be at the heart of our new system and will be critically important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are some of the areas we've been able to invest in through our responsible economic management, making sure that the priorities are focused on supporting people now and into the future but still delivering a budget surplus. That is so important when it comes to responsible economic management and putting downward pressure on inflation, and we will continue to act responsibly.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300006" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHANEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  My summary takeaway on the budget is that it's good to see a surplus this year but I'm concerned about the looming deficits and their possible impact on inflation. We do need to do more about long-term issues like tax reform and productivity. The budget does contain some long-term thinking in the Future Made in Australia package, which is being introduced this week, but the devil will be in how it's implemented. I want to say a bit about cost-of-living relief; a long-term perspective on the budget, including tax reform productivity and climate; and how the budget is addressing a range of specific issues raised by my constituents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On cost of living, there is no doubt that this budget comes at a difficult time. Every time I'm out in my electorate, I hear about the cost-of-living challenges people are facing. Managing inflation is the best way to reduce cost-of-living pressures, and the government's fiscal policy is one of many levers that affect inflation—but it's one that the government can actually control. In this budget, the government has tried to walk the fine line of providing cost-of-living relief without injecting more money into the economy and making inflation worse. Is it working? Recent inflation figures do create some additional concerns, but we won't really get a clear picture until we see the June quarter, and we won't see the full impact of the stage 3 tax cuts until the next quarter. Based on consumer confidence, which is a bit lower, it may be that people will slow their spending and the stage 3 tax cuts reshape may not have an additional upward pressure on inflation. It remains to be seen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $300 energy rebate may technically reduce the measure of inflation but it does seem like a blunt instrument, given that it's not means tested. We've seen no increase in the base rate of JobSeeker. We have seen a small increase in Commonwealth rent assistance and some tweaks to JobSeeker for people with reduced capacity to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget includes the previously announced changes to stage 3 tax cuts which came into effect this week, HECS indexation and paid placement for students, and a freeze on medicine copayments for everyone with a Medicare card. For many in my electorate, these measures will be welcome. Time will tell what impact this will have on inflation, and the government will no doubt bear responsibility for whatever happens to interest rates, despite the independence of the RBA and the other factors at play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest cost-of-living issue raised with me in my electorate, and reiterated by a recent survey in my electorate, is housing. The budget contains new housing investment of $6.2 billion and a further $1 billion to help states and territories with infrastructure, as well as a 10 per cent increase in Commonwealth rent assistance and additional concessional loans for community housing providers and other charities to support the delivery of new homes. I often hear that people can't find a builder. This budget promises 20,000 additional fee-free TAFE places for construction-related courses and $1.8 million to streamline skills assessment for about 1,900 migrants from comparable countries who want to work in Australia's housing construction industry. Will this be enough on housing? Probably not, but I hope it helps. The reality is that it has taken us 20 years to get into our current crisis situation on housing, and it's unlikely to be fixed in one budget. Housing will be a significant election issue, and it would be good to see longer term policy approaches from both sides that are bolder than setting aspirational targets and throwing more fuel on the fire by adding superannuation to the spending pool. We need a clear vision on how affordable housing should actually be, and then our policies can be pulling in the same direction to get there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Taking a long-term view, I see one plus and two minuses in the budget. The Future Made in Australia package can be a kickstart to encourage investment and a modernised net zero economy. What I like about this is it addresses climate in a proactive way, recognising that the world is changing and we want to be part of that change in the world. Too often, the conversation about climate is about what we have to lose, how much it will cost to adapt and how terrible everything is. While we need this as context to actually drive the change, this budget shows that the conversation has matured. We're looking at the incredible opportunities available for Australia—and, in particular, Western Australia—if we can actually get this transition right. We currently rank between Namibia and Uganda on economic complexity, with our largely dig-and-ship economy. We need to invest in adding value to our resources, which would make us more resilient while building on the comparative advantages we have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Future Made in Australia package sounds promising, and is a response to calls from me and others for an Australian answer to the US Inflation Reduction Act. Its success will depend on how it is implemented, how investment decisions are made, how quickly, and whether it supports the right industries that can ultimately stand on their own feet. Funding production tax incentives for critical minerals is good for Western Australia as we try to encourage investment to add value and green energy to our abundance of mineral deposits. I have advocated for this approach. This way, we are spending taxpayer funds only if something is actually produced in strategically targeted areas where a leg-up is needed in the transition phase. We've heard about some investments already, and, to be frank, it's very hard to assess whether these are good investments based on the minimal information provided. Going forward, I'll be advocating for transparency on how investment decisions are made under the Future Made in Australia package—both those already made and those still to come—so that taxpayer money is being used to set us up for future success, not to fund pet projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things missing in this budget is significant tax reform. We have the stage 3 tax cuts, which are much-needed cost-of-living relief, but they're not real tax reform. We need to ensure that we're not spending what we don't have in the budget. This year's surplus masks an underlying structural deficit, and is expected to be followed by two deficit budgets. Gross debt will peak at 33.9 per cent of GDP by the middle of next year. This is a real concern and raises the issue of intergenerational equity. Over the long term, we want to be able to afford services like child care, aged care and the NDIS, but we still rely too heavily on taxing effort via income with our ageing population. Income tax makes up half of all of our tax, which is one of the highest proportions in the world. We have an increasing burden on a declining proportion of the population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People across the whole political spectrum are calling for tax reform: simplification and rebalancing between personal tax, corporate tax and consumption tax; economic rents from natural resources; and taxes to address social, environmental or economic costs. We need to think about the balance between old and young Australians and make good on the intergenerational bargain to support people at the vulnerable beginning and end of life in exchange for the promise that things will keep getting better. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that significant reform is politically hard. The political focus on winning elections and short-term handouts wins more votes than long-term structural changes. One of our key long-term problems is that we are no longer a high-growth or high-productivity country. Economic growth enables us to provide the services the community expects and demands. Forecast growth is softening considerably both globally and in Australia, where the growth forecasts have now been downgraded. Growth is driven by productivity, creating more value from less. This budget does not seem to have significant productivity reforms. I would have liked to see red tape reduction or IR simplification to make it easier to do business in Australia. Our industrial relations system is one of the most complex in the world, and we should be able to protect workers' rights without the endless complexity we've created. Addressing productivity will require thinking about how to make it easier to employ people, not harder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest long-term challenge we face is obviously climate change. While there are some positives in this budget on climate, including the funding of the Net Zero Economy Authority, Powering the Regions and Future Made in Australia, there are some big gaps. We're still sending mixed messages about our commitment to decarbonise, with the recent commitment to expand and extend the gas industry well into the second half of the century. We're also continuing to pay fossil fuel subsidies and take an embarrassingly low tax revenue from fossil fuel companies. There's funding allocated for the regulation of carbon capture and storage. Now, CCS is a necessary development given that every future energy plan contains some gas, but it's not been very successful in the past, and I don't think taxpayers should be funding it. Let the companies that rely on it for their expansion prove that it works. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a range of constituent issues that have been raised that are addressed in this budget, including students—it's good to see the change to HELP and HECS—aged care and child care. It's good to see additional home-care packages, some NDIS reform and additional resources for Services Australia. We've seen some additional allocation for mental health services, which is important too. On balance, this budget has something in it for a lot of Australians. But, other than the outline of the Future Made in Australia package, there's little of the long-term reform we will need to see if we want to be a prosperous and fair country in a generation's time. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  This budget is about easing cost-of-living pressures, and there is a massive amount of support in this budget. Every taxpayer in my electorate, and 13.6 million people around the country, is getting a tax cut. Every household is getting energy bill relief, the 2.6 million workers on award wages are getting a pay rise, and there are now cheaper medicines and an extra two weeks of paid parental leave. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, the budget is also about building more homes for Australia, and there's a $32 billion package here. This government has been undertaking the task of building more homes for Australians—social and affordable housing or other sorts of assistance. It's investing in our Future Made in Australia with a commitment of $22.7 billion. We are strengthening Medicare and the care economy with an extra $2.8 billion in the budget. We're broadening opportunities and advancing equality in the budget as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do recall those 'debt bombshell' trucks travelling around the country before the 2013 election, with photos of the then Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, sitting in front of them. Then of course we had Tony Abbott, the then Leader of the Opposition after him, because they swapped leaders as much as we did—or more, actually. In terms of the budget papers, there was $189 billion in debt when we left office in 2013. It was forecast to be $1.3 trillion in debt when those opposite left. It got as high as $1 trillion. You're talking about a situation with a forecast of 55 per cent of GDP. The hypocrisy of debt being seven times bigger under the coalition than under us is simply rank and rife, to be honest with you. We get lectures about debt and deficit from those opposite, when the deficit from the previous budget of the coalition government before they lost office, of $78 billion, has been turned into tens of billions of dollars of surplus under Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing a moderation of CPI. We know people are doing it tough, but the inflation rate is now half of what it was at the peak under the coalition. It was at 6.1 per cent when they lost office. That was the situation under those opposite. They couldn't bank a saving, year after year. I recall the opposition Treasury spokesperson, Joe Hockey, saying that they would deliver a surplus in their first year and every year thereafter. They handed down a budget in 2014 that led to the decline and dismissal by the coalition caucus of the then Prime Minister, Tony Abbott. To get lectures from those opposite is a bit hypocritical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are providing an enormous amount of cost-of-living relief in this budget. In my electorate 80,000 people get a tax cut. Ninety per cent of taxpayers are better off under us than they would have been under the Morrison government. If you're earning up to $45,000 a year, you would have had no tax relief under the coalition, but under us there's tax relief, and it's in the budget. Some local families will see an entire month of mortgage repayments wiped away by this budget. Some will be able to pay off their homes faster thanks to the tax cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also providing $300 in energy bill relief for every household in Blair, and $325 for small businesses. It comes on top of the thousand dollars delivered by the Queensland government's energy rebate, which means a household in Blair can get up to $1,300 in total off their electricity bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned before the 2.6 million Australians benefiting from a rise in the minimum wage. This is the third consecutive pay rise for those low-paid workers. Many of them were heroes in the pandemic. Aged-care workers and retail workers did it tough. Many of them got abused. They had really difficult shift work. Those opposite couldn't see themselves at all fit to support a pay rise at any stage during nine years of long coalition rule. A combination, for example, of Labor's tax cuts and wage rises means that many workers in my electorate will be $50 a week better off. They will earn more and keep more of what they earn through the entire year. That's really important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July we have frozen the cost of PBS medicines for everyone. That makes an enormous difference for people. I recall those opposite saying pharmacists were going to reel when we spread out the scripts from 30 days to 60 days. All of a sudden there were pharmacies that were going to collapse. I dealt with the over 30 pharmacies in my electorate. I haven't seen one pharmacy close; not one. None of the pharmacists have told me they had to put off staff. What we're doing is providing additional support to strengthen Medicare and provide additional support for cheaper medicines. Pensioners and concession card holders in my electorate won't pay more than $7.70 for their PBS medications for five years thanks to the Albanese government's commitment to cheaper medicines. Residents in my electorate have already saved more than $2 million thanks to the Albanese government's commitment to delivering cheaper medicines. Everyone in Blair who accesses PBS medicines is set to save even more thanks to our freeze on the maximum cost of the PBS. We're investing $4 billion to help deliver cheaper medicines to ease the cost pressures on household budgets. We've also added more medicines on the PBS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've invested $2.8 billion to strengthen Medicare by providing additional Medicare urgent care clinics. The urgent care clinic in Ipswich is a big success. There have been about 6,000 visits to that clinic since it was opened. It works in conjunction with the satellite hospital delivered by Queensland Health at Ripley, as well as the emergency department at Ipswich Hospital. That's really important. We're expanding Medicare coverage in the budget to four MRI machines in Blair, expanding affordable access to imaging services in my electorate. That's very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the biggest sources of assistance in this budget is the $3 billion in student HELP debt relief that we are providing, which I think is really important. I've got both the University of Southern Queensland Springfield campus and the University of Southern Queensland Ipswich campus in my electorate, so this helps 23,000 people in my electorate with a HELP debt. We've increased the maximum rate of Commonwealth rent assistance by 10 per cent, and that builds on the 15 per cent of the previous budget. That helps more than 12,000 households in Blair. That, combined with the other changes we've made, makes a huge difference to people on low incomes who are battling. The additional two weeks of paid parental leave brings the entitlement to 22 weeks a year. We're providing more funding for more homes in my electorate, boosting house supply and affordability. You can see that in suburbs like Ripley and Springfield and other suburbs in my electorate. We're providing a lot of assistance in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the big changes that we've made that helps a lot of people is reforming the disability sector. I had Bill Shorten in my electorate, the Minister for Government Services. He's got responsibility for reforming the NDIS, and that's really critical. Those foundational supports were taken away by state and territory governments, and we, in partnership with the states and territories, are bringing those foundational supports. Not everyone qualifies for the NDIS. Not everyone does. But we're providing additional support, and in the budget we provided an extra $468.7 million to support people with disability and get the NDIS back on track.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As of 31 December 2023, there were a total of 646,449 participants in the NDIS. There are many, many thousands in my electorate. It is absolutely crucial. And I know that my electorate has a lot of people living with disability because, historically, it's been an area where we had, for example, the Challinor Centre, based on the campus of the University of Southern Queensland. People living in institutions were then brought into the community, and that was a good thing. It was a humane and decent thing to do. We've also got a large number of people living with disability who have access to the NDIS, and it's a great reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the member for Maribyrnong, the minister for government service delivery, for the work he's doing in reforming the NDIS. It's a big, critical part of the budget. I know that the growth in it had to be tempered and that it's a reform of the process. There are too many fraudsters and crooks associated with the NDIS. We want people to get the care they deserve and need, and the financial support that is provided in the NDIS is critical for that space. But we need to make sure that this particular system is viable and will continue, and that's why the budget is so important for my electorate, particularly for people living with disability.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="267506" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KENNEDY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  I'd like to talk about healthcare funding in this budget, particularly around MRI machines. Sutherland Hospital, my local hospital, has campaigned for years for an MRI machine. This MRI machine finally arrived in 2023, but it could not be used for outpatients. I learnt about this during the recent Cook by-election. I had a resident come up to me and tell me that she was forced to choose between a six-month wait time at Kogarah hospital and being out of pocket by $700 to $800 to go private. In the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, we're forcing people to choose between waiting for six months to get an MRI or paying $800.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I picked up this issue and campaigned hard for it as part of the Cook by-election. Murray Trembath covered this in the local paper, the<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">St George and Sutherland Shire </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Leader</span>. We started a petition, which hundreds of people have signed. I've personally raised this with Health Minister Butler and his office. And I have to give credit where credit is due—Minister Butler has listened. Labor has announced $70 million for MRI machine funding, and I'm told that Sutherland Shire will now get an MRI machine licence for outpatients in 2027.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While this is welcome news, and while I commend Minister Butler for listening to me during my campaign in the Cook by-election and for listening to the residents of Cook, 2027 is still too late. I'm told that the Sutherland Hospital is the only public hospital in metropolitan Australia that does not have an MRI machine funded for outpatients. Thank you for listening, Mr Butler, but we now need to bring this forward. The residents of Cook cannot wait another three years to be forced to choose between six-month wait times and $700 to $800 for an MRI. I'm asking Minister Butler, in addition to what he has already done—it's fantastic; thank you very much for funding this important initiative—to now please bring this forward for Sutherland Hospital and get the residents of Cook and the surrounding areas access to MRIs sooner and more cheaply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue facing my community that was not addressed in this budget was funding for the compliance of e-bikes. Unsafe and inappropriate e-bike use is a major concern in my electorate and my community. This was one of the most raised issues in the recent Cook by-election, and it's something I've listened to the community about and I've acted on. Hundreds of residents have been in touch with me; they signed up to the petition. I had over 15 local residents attend a local community forum last week. We had Peter Bourke address these local constituents on current regulations. We had Sutherland Shire Council officials and the chamber of commerce. It was a very positive discussion indeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, it was raised that we could have better import regulations from the federal government—and I'll be writing to Minister King about this. Yes, we can have more regulations at a state level and local level. But my main takeaway was that 90 per cent of the concerns of my local residents can be addressed today by enforcing local regulations. I'm pleased to announce that, coming out of that forum, we already have progress. Council officials have committed to putting up more signs. They have also committed to putting more bike racks at the start and end of the mall so people can park their e-bikes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we need more. We need police patrolling the area, we need police stopping kids riding illegal modified e-bikes and we need strict adherence to import rules. I am briefing Mark Speakman, the opposition leader in the state, on this. He has called for an upper house inquiry, which I will also be making a submission to as the member for Cook. I'm also briefing the new local police commander on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's also a need for federal government action. In 2021, the federal government changed the definition of an e-bike and removed the requirement for an import permit. I will be raising with Minister King the need to relook at these permits to make sure that the bikes we get in this country are safe and keep residents safe in my community. Only a few months ago a three-year-old boy had his leg broken clean in half, so it's about time we funded this important issue in the budget and we listened to the residents of the Sutherland shire and Cook.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, it's time to look at this budget and see what it tells us about the Anthony Albanese government. In this budget we see what Anthony Albanese believes will solve the cost-of-living crisis. What does Anthony Albanese believe will solve this cost-of-living crisis? More government. Across the last three budgets, Labor has committed an additional $315 billion in inflationary spending. This accounts for almost $30,000 per household in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government clearly thinks the answer to this cost-of-living crisis is more government. What is their answer to higher energy costs? A $300 subsidy. What is their answer to higher childcare costs? More subsidies. What is their answer to low first-home ownership? Asking the government to take equity in people's homes. In the Liberal Party we are a little bit different. We believe in different answers. While Labor believes the answer to higher energy costs is, yes, a $300 subsidy, the Liberals believe the answer is actually lower energy prices. Labor believes the answer to higher childcare costs is higher childcare subsidies. In the Liberal Party we believe the answer is actually lower childcare prices. In the Labor Party they believe the answer to low first-home ownership is the government buying equity in your house. In the Liberal Party we believe it is lower home prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How do we get lower energy prices? Well, we need more supply of clean, cheap and reliable energy—not the closure of plants and certainly not the writing off of an entire technology without first investigating it. We should be looking at supply from all sources, including nuclear. How do we get lower childcare prices? More childcare centres. Let's look at the regulations and let's look at what's needed to get more childcare centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How do we get more first home buyers? We need more houses, a greater supply of housing. Instead, Labor believes in giving out subsidy after subsidy. What is the Labor government going to do when the money runs out? The truth is that many of these subsidies only last for a year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the sugar hit of $300—$75 a quarter—to pay new energy prices runs out, what are Australians to do with these rising energy prices? This isn't just a one-off subsidy. Yes, it will lower prices, but unfortunately it will try and trick the Australian public into thinking that inflation is moderating. Well, it's not. We've seen inflation go up consistently this year. We are now at 4.4 per cent core inflation, while the US, the UK, the euro region, Sweden and Canada are all seeing moderate inflation. It's lower than it is in Australia, and it's going down. In Australia it's going up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like the Albanese government to explain why Australia is different. What makes Australia so special that inflation here is going up, while everywhere else in the world it's going down? I can tell you what it is. It's this expansionary Labor government. You don't increase government spending by $315 billion without any consequences. You don't increase government spending by $30,000 per household without any consequences. The Australian people are just about to learn what these consequences are. These consequences are increasing inflation, higher interest rates for longer, higher mortgage repayments for longer and electricity and gas going up over 20 per cent year on year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When electricity and gas are going up 20 per cent year on year, what does that mean? It means that the average Australian household will see their energy prices double every three years. As you're sitting at home there, looking at that one-off $300 subsidy, think about what that is going to do for you in three years time when your energy prices double. What is that going to do to you in six years time when your energy prices have doubled twice? In the Liberal Party, we believe in increasing supply. We believe in looking at all sources of energy, including nuclear, to make sure we have the broadest and most robust supply of clean, reliable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have locked in bad workplace laws that are also driving up the cost of doing business. Families are now being slugged with higher tax, and Australian household industry, small-business industry, is breaking.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="276714" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  I rise to speak on the 2024-25 Albanese Labor budget. The member for Cook can be forgiven because, to be fair, he wasn't here to get one of the notorious 'Back in black' mugs and he wasn't here for the 22 failed policies on energy of the previous Morrison, Turnbull and Abbott governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when governments are doing everything they can to fight inflation, we are also walking a fine line to deliver real cost-of-living relief that doesn't add to the very inflation we are trying to tame. In the face of these challenges, the Albanese government is rising to the task, delivering consecutive surpluses and paying down debt, while also giving every Australian a tax cut. It is a budget that is unapologetically about both fairness and responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, low-paid workers are seeing real wage growth, with record increases delivered for award wage workers in 2022, 2023 and now also 2024, with full-time workers on the national minimum wage earning $110 more a week than when the government came to office. This is important for care workers, retail workers and hospitality workers, not just across Bean but across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just wages increasing; workers across the country are now keeping more of what they earn. This includes 82,000 taxpayers in Bean—every single taxpayer—who will receive a tax cut. The average tax cut for taxpayers in my electorate will be over $1,800. Under this government's plan, an additional 2.9 million Australians earning $45,000 or less, who were previously excluded under Scott Morrison's plan, are now sharing in the benefits of these tax cuts—fair and responsible. Additionally, from this week, more than 10 million households across Australia will receive a total rebate of $300 and eligible small businesses will receive $325 on their electricity bills throughout the year. As I said, just this week, the minimum wage increased to $24.10. This 3.75 per cent increase, combined with Labor's tax cuts, means that a retail worker in Bean is now bringing in at least an extra $110 per week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our 2024-25 budget is about easing the cost of living, a second surplus, a future made in Australia, more homes for Australia, the care economy and broadening opportunity. The government is investing an additional $477 million in the 2024-25 budget to increase our support to the more than 340,000 veterans and dependants accessing services through the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Thanks to these investments from the Albanese Labor government, funding for the Department of Veterans' Affairs remains at a record high, now better funded than it's been in three decades. For Bean, that's some 6,870 veterans who will benefit from this commitment. The 2024-25 budget delivers funding to implement and deliver the Albanese government's simplified and harmonised veterans compensation legislation. Following the successful implementation of 500 additional frontline staff at DVA to reduce the veterans compensation claims backlog, we're investing further with $186 million towards the employment of an additional 141 staff to ensure that backlogs don't re-emerge and to make claims processing faster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just our veterans in Bean that will be better off. This budget also delivers targeted support for pensioners and income support recipients. Pensioners and concession card holders in Bean won't pay more than $7.70 for their PBS medications for the next five years thanks to the Albanese government's commitment to delivering cheaper medicines. Targeted support will come in the form of a 10 per cent increase to maximum rates of Commonwealth rent assistance, which will directly benefit over 2,000 households in Bean and nearly one million households across the country. This builds on the 15 per cent increase from September last year and will increase maximum rates to 40 per cent higher than in May 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget also continues to freeze social security deeming rates for a further 12 months. In Bean this will support nearly 6,000 support recipients, including pensioners, jobseekers and recipients of the parenting payment, student payments or carer payments. Building on this, more than 900 participants in Bean will benefit from increased funding for a new specialised disability employment program that prepares people living with disability to find suitable employment. By investing $2.8 billion in Services Australia, the Albanese government will also make it easier for Australians to access these government services to which they're entitled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think of the dedicated public servants who will benefit from the proper resourcing that only a Labor government can deliver by returning human oversight to government services. This government is committed to strengthening Services Australia's services by investing, of that $2.8 billion, $1.8 billion in staff, including funding for 4,030 staff in 2024-25 and 3,530 staff in 2025-26, along with continued investment in 850 emergency response staff. This will help the claim processing times and call wait times and will support those impacted by an emergency, crisis or vulnerability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a matter of immense pride that my electorate of Bean headquarters Services Australia. Whilst all of us know our service centres and have good relationships with those service centres, for me it's a real element of pride to be able to represent those employees right across the programs and systems of Services Australia and to ensure that they get the support they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing remains a priority for Australians of all generations, backgrounds and stages of life. This budget outlines Labor's plan to fix the structural issues that our housing market faces, because we on this side believe that every Australian deserves to be a homeowner. The budget includes more than $6 billion in new measures to build more homes and support Australians, bringing this government's new housing initiatives over the next decade to more than $30 billion. We're building more social and affordable rental housing, with a $2.5 billion increase in the liability cap of Housing Australia and an additional $3 billion in loans to Housing Australia to support ongoing delivery of the program. We're unlocking up to a billion dollars for more homes through the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, to be directed towards housing that supports women and children fleeing domestic and family violence and that supports young Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Albanese Labor government has worked hard to improve the quality of life of and restore dignity for older Australians. We've put nurses back into nursing homes, given residents more time with their carers, lifted wages in the sector and improved transparency and accountability. This budget continues this work. Since the October 2022-23 budget, total investment in aged care has increased by 30 per cent. This includes more than $11 billion to deliver the largest one-off increase to aged-care wages in history, with more increases in future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget has also laid out the government's plan for manufacturing in Australia. The $22.7 billion plan for a future made in Australia will help make us an indispensable part of the global economy by: helping us to attract investment; making our country a renewable energy superpower; value-adding to our resources and increasing economic security; backing Australian ideas, innovation and science; and investing in our people and places. These policies complement the government's broader growth agenda, including our competition reforms, our investments in infrastructure, housing, human capital and defence industries, and our support for small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to our Future Made in Australia plan, the Albanese government is investing $350 million over four years to deliver fee-free uni-ready courses, to prepare students for university. We're also establishing Commonwealth prac payments for students undertaking mandatory prac placements. From 1 July 2025, the payments will provide more than 73,000 eligible students—including student teachers, nurses, midwives and social workers—with more than $319 per week during their placements. This is critical in addressing the shortages in these fields.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of this work would have been possible without taking a much more responsible, restrained and disciplined approach to the budget than those opposite took. This is a budget for all Australians. I commend my good friend the Treasurer for his work in balancing the books while responsibly delivering real support for Australian households, and not needing a series of mugs to justify it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="295676" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  We heard, before, the member for Cook sharing the story that the Sutherland hospital in his electorate doesn't have an MRI. Well, it's not only the Sutherland Shire's hospital that doesn't have an MRI machine; Fairfield Hospital in my electorate of Fowler doesn't have an MRI machine, either. Not only that, but the hospital has a hand clinic which services people from across the region and yet is operating out of a demountable. So, in terms of the health needs of our area, there's so much that needs real investment from the federal and state governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been almost two months since the 2024-25 budget was released. The Future Made in Australia plan was the centrepiece—except I saw less of a future for my constituents in Fowler and Western Sydney. We ticked over to the new financial year on 1 July 2024, and I know that the government has paraded their budget achievements—such as the tax cuts and the one-off energy relief rebate of $300 for every household and $325 for small businesses. This may sound like a good deal for Australians and small businesses, but is it really—especially for my constituents in Fowler?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, I asked the Prime Minister in the chamber whether he could guarantee that struggling families in Western Sydney wouldn't go backwards with their cost of living from 1 July following these grand announcements from the budget. In a roundabout way, there was no guarantee from the Prime Minister and the government. I get that the tax cuts would provide some relief to my constituents; however, a one-off $300 payment provides minimal support in the face of the four per cent rise in CPI and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. Household expenditures and prices remain volatile amidst inflation. Costs for food, energy and other household needs have jumped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, honestly, the people of Fowler would feel the pressure the most. Our median personal weekly income is $521 and median family weekly income is $1,529. The median weekly rent is about $370. An individual within Fowler on the median wage would be left with about $151. They would need to pay for their groceries, the cost of community work and the needs of their children. I don't need to do the maths to know that they're spreading their money thin to survive in this economy. And that's not to mention the high petrol prices. I have continually called on the government to do something about this issue, to provide some kind of short-term relief for families who use cars to drive long distances to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I held a 'bring your bill' day earlier this year. Over 100 constituents came to our event. They were struggling to pay their bills. Most shared that they were unable to keep up with the cost-of-living crisis. I had constituents bring their children to the event, asking if we were offering free meal services or relief. This is heartbreaking. As a parent, your duty is to be able to give your children the most basic need for their upbringing: food. Yet this is becoming a challenge, especially in Western Sydney. Even after the 'bring your bill' day event, we had an influx of constituents contacting our office for further assistance and facilitation of cost-of-living relief. Due to the demand, I have decided to hold a second 'bring your bill' day, in August 2024, to assist my struggling constituents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am doing what I can to assist my constituents on the ground. I ask that the government do more to assist with the cost-of-living crisis and offer relief that targets Australians who are doing it tough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My qualms with this budget do not stop there. Small businesses get almost no slice of the pie within the budget. Eligible small businesses can expect a one-off $325 rebate on their energy bill. Now, I know that there are small businesses in my electorate whose energy bill has almost tripled, from $4,000 to almost $12,000. So, while this $325 is a great thing, I don't know how big a dent it will make on such large bills for small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that the $20,000 instant asset write-off for small businesses has been extended for another 12 months. However, the cost of equipment and inventory exceeds this and the instant asset write-off may not give the relief required. Instead, we should invest more in small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Made in Australia plan revealed a one-billion-dollar initiative to create a manufacturing base for solar products. My electorate is replete with manufacturers, and manufacturing is the largest employer in my electorate. Why are we not investing in smaller manufacturing companies that have the potential to grow and develop in a globally competitive market? This will also create more jobs for Australians and those within my electorate. This is such a missed opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned before, our health system, I think, is really broken, and something has to be done about it. Our hospitals have been overwhelmed in trying to keep up with patients. As to measures, I understand there's an additional $227 million over three years from 2023-24 to boost the capacity of Medicare urgent care clinics, including 29 new clinics across Australia, but at what cost? What impact will this have on local GPs, especially in south-west Sydney, where there's a critical shortage of GPs? Why is Fowler left behind when it comes to health care?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the release of the budget, I've had aged-care providers and nurses reaching out to me to share their disappointment with the budget. We all know that the aged-care system is due for reform and no longer fit for purpose. We are expecting an aged-care bill to address the royal commission's findings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I held an aged-care forum to get to the bottom of what was not working. Aged-care professionals have shared that the aged-care industry has become less attractive to work in and they're struggling to retain skilled professionals. Particularly within Fowler, there was a high demand for aged-care professionals who can support older culturally and linguistically diverse people. This was a big gap in providing for our ageing population in the aged-care services sector. The budget has put forward $65.6 million over four years from 2024-25 to attract and retain aged-care workers, collect more reliable data and improve outcomes for people receiving aged-care services. This is a big figure. How exactly is the fund being utilised to attract and retain talent, though? This is elusive to me and those aged-care professionals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I could go on about whether the government has fallen short in the budget for my constituents, my intention is to simply bring to the government's attention that we can do more to aid Australians. The disappointing budget measures are a testament to this.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  Few speeches in this chamber are as closely examined or analysed as the Treasurer's annual budget speech. Reams of column space and hours of broadcast and airtime are devoted to dissecting every aspect of it. The reason for the intense interest in the budget is obvious. Budgets matter. They matter a lot. They matter for the country and the way it is travelling and moving forward, and they matter for the individual. Both aspects are equally important. For the country, the budget is a technical statement on our economy. It's a barometer, if you like, of how we are travelling and our estimated revenues and expenditures. For the individual, on the other hand, the budget is a clear demonstration, in financial and other ways, of understanding where the government's priorities lie. So, if budgets matter, what does the most recent budget say to the country as a whole and to the individual? What message is it conveying?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the country, the budget clearly says that, in difficult global times, we are making progress. We may be an island continent, but we are not an island economy; hence, international concerns, interest rates and inflation are also very much our concerns. On these issues, though, progress has been made. For the second year in a row, a budget surplus has been delivered—an outstanding result. But it would be fair to say that the key to our economy is understanding that matters are finely poised, and, while we can remain quietly optimistic and confident, we need to remain vigilant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, what does the most recent budget say to the individual in Australia, the pay-as-you-go taxpayer? What's the take-home message for them? The answer here, I think, lies in my former statements. Australians can be quietly confident about the future. They can be confident that the inflationary pressures that are driving the cost-of-living pressures are being addressed. They can be confident that responsible measures announced in the budget will make a real difference without adding any further inflationary pressures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We look at the budget measures in this budget and we see a truly Labor budget—one that delivers for all Australians, not just a few; one that delivers real cost-of-living relief for all Australians to help with their everyday pressures. Across every part of this Labor budget and across every portfolio, the Albanese government is helping Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July, every Australian will be paying less tax. That's 13.6 million Australian taxpayers who'll be better off under this government's fairer and better changes to the stage 3 tax cuts. In my community of Werriwa, that means over 80,000 Australians will be paying less tax. Under the Albanese government's bigger and fairer tax cuts, an additional 2.9 million Australians will now receive a tax cut, when compared to the coalition's plan. More low- and middle-income Australians will benefit. That's real money in the pockets of hardworking Australians, making a big difference to those in my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Changes to the previous government's tax plan will also see an increase in the Medicare levy low-income threshold, which will mean more than one million Australians will continue to be exempt from the Medicare levy or pay a reduced rate. The increase to the threshold will help those on low incomes keep more of what they earn, helping many in my community and across Australia who are doing it tough. This is because the government believes all Australians should earn more and keep more of what they earn. The budget delivers on that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost-of-living measures in this budget don't end there. The budget delivers $300 in energy bill relief for every Australian household from 1 July. So every household will see a $75 reduction in their quarterly bills over the 2024-25 financial year. Energy bill relief is good for Australian households and good for the economy. It helps put downward pressure on inflation, which benefits everyone. Small businesses also benefit, with a $325 energy rebate for eligible small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also helps one million Australian households with the cost of rent by increasing the maximum rate of Commonwealth assistance by a further 10 per cent, building on the 15 per cent increase in September 2023. That builds on the increased assistance since we came to office in 2022. In my community over 9,000 households have benefited from these increases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also continues to freeze social security deeming rates for a further 12 months, supporting over 6,000 income support recipients in Werriwa, including jobseekers and people on parenting payments, student payments and carer payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to these measures, the Albanese government is freezing the cost of the maximum PBS co-payment for scripts to no more than $31.60 until 2026. For those Australians on pension or concession cards, the maximum PBS co-payment is frozen at $7.70 for five years, ensuring that Australians don't have to choose between filling a script and putting food on the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget not only addresses the short- to medium-term issues facing Australians but invests in supporting Australians in the long term. In Werriwa and broadly across Western Sydney, our communities have endured consistent underfunding in our infrastructure, the effects of which are now being acutely felt. Our communities have rapidly grown, yet the infrastructure investment required to support the growth has fallen short. This has markedly changed since 2022, with our election to government and with the election of the Minns government in 2023. Whilst it will take some time to make up for the lost investment, the government is committed to seeing Western Sydney succeed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget delivers much-needed infrastructure funding to Western Sydney and my community of Werriwa. It delivers $1.9 billion towards 14 new projects and two existing projects, including Mamre Road stage 2 upgrade; Elizabeth Drive priority sections upgrade; Western Sydney Rapid Bus infrastructure upgrade; Cambridge Avenue upgrade; Western Sydney Freight Line stage 1; Western Sydney roads future planning; and South West Rail planning. Many familiar with these roads will know how traffic prone they are and how vital the investment will be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is also locking in progressive increases to local roads funding under the Roads to Recovery Program and the Black Spot Program. Liverpool City Council will receive $12.59 million under Roads to Recovery, a boost of $5.4 million, under our government. In total, the five-year investment in Roads to Recovery for councils in Werriwa will increase to more than $45 million. I know that this investment will make a huge difference to my community. It will mean that they will get home sooner, spend less time in traffic and spend more time with their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget also delivers more funding for mental health services, with a $361 million investment to expand mental health service access for Australians. It builds on previous investments announced in the October 2022 budget and the May 2023 budget. A good example of this is the headspace in Edmondson Park. This was a commitment I took to the 2022 election, and I'm delighted to say it is now being delivered on. Recently I visited the site at Edmondson Park alongside the Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Emma McBride. Once the building work is complete, my community will benefit from better access to mental health services. I look forward to it being open in August this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not press release announcements. These are investments in real people and services and make a tangible difference in all our communities. I commenced my remarks today by noting that budgets matter and that few issues discussed in this place draw more public attention or scrutiny in the media. In a world where freedom of the press is often challenged and genuine analysis of government policies is often lacking, the scrutiny is welcome and in fact is needed more now than ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this regard, I am firm in the belief that any serious examination of the 2024 Australian federal budget will show that it is finely tailored and cut for the time. It gets the balance right and it provides confidence for markets and investors, both nationally and globally, as well as responding to the real and genuine needs of the Australian public and my community in Werriwa. The 2024 budget is good for the economy and good for working Australians. It delivers where it needs to and hits the mark. I commend it to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="230531" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUCHHOLZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  It's a great privilege to be able to speak on the budget papers, a machination in this House which is an extension of the appropriations bills, because it's an opportunity for the opposition to share just how difficult people are finding trying to make ends meet under these cost-of-living pressures that have been inflicted on them by a poor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have got people in my electorate, elderly people, dealing with power prices that have near tripled. Elderly people, such as friends of my mum, are making decisions not to turn a heater on in the middle of winter in fear that they have no understanding as to how they can make the power bill payments, so they choose to put another layer of clothing on rather than inflict upon themselves a greater cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have working families, double-income households, mums and dads working full time and trying to pay off a mortgage. On 12 consecutive occasions since this government came to office, their mortgage payments have gone up and up and up. There's actually a new economic term these days for those working families. They're called the 'new working poor', who are making decisions around what meals they can put on the table each night for their families because their disposable incomes under this government have become so minuscule that the only way that they can make savings to try to make ends meet is through the different purchasing decisions they make when it comes to feeding their own children. They've got to make the car payment, they've got to make the house payment and they've got to make the insurance payment, all of which have gone up under this government. I'll get to the reason why when I speak on the inflationary pressures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on the other side of the parliament come to this chamber and say that there's $300 worth of relief coming for energy prices. That is a bandaid on a bullet wound. When your electricity payments have gone up $700 for the year and their idea of economic relief is $75 each quarter, that is laughable. But then, from an inflationary perspective, when you use that $75 handout, a previous parliament's prime minister once said, 'When someone tells you something is for free, that just means that somebody else is paying for it.' So the question we have to ask ourselves around the policy of handouts is: is it actually helping the economic environment at the moment, or is it kicking the tin down the road, where someone is going to have to pay for it in the long term?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the budget papers and what the big costs are on our balance sheet, the two biggest ones that we have into the forward estimates are: (1) the NDIS, and I'll get to some of the out-of-control spending that's happening in that space—ultimately, the pensioners in my electorate who are choosing to sit in the cold and are still making tax payments will end up paying for that; and (2) interest on debt. So, when we borrow money to hand out as handouts, we're only kicking the tin down the road and making it a problem for our children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government have been appalling managers of our economy, and it's been a trainwreck since the day they arrived. Prior to the election, on 200 occasions they said on the record that they'd provide a $275 tax relief. They're trying to say now that by giving the $300 they're honouring that commitment, but the reality is that, as I've outlined earlier, there has been a $700 increase, and the $300 goes nowhere near fixing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason they're poor economic managers is that they've got different priorities. When we were in government, we looked to address the real cost-of-living pressures. When these guys have got a spare $450 million, they run off around the country delivering a referendum on the Voice. Not one state supported them—not one single state. It was near-on 70 per cent across the country, with the exception of one of the territories. It was the greatest waste of money our country has experienced and an enormous policy failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I don't know who makes the strategy decisions for the Australian Labor Party, because, immediately after that, somebody decided that it would be a good idea if they went and let a couple of hundred detainees out of detention to run around the country. Yes, the courts said that one of them needed to be let out, but the court didn't indicate that everyone had to be let out. Murderers, paedophiles—some of the worst characters who we had locked up—were let out, and then the taxpayer was asked to house them. So I've got pensioners who can't turn the heater on, and in a cost-of-living crisis we're providing housing for the most undesirable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, as I've mentioned, there have been the 12 hikes in interest rates. If you have a household mortgage, under this government you have felt every single one of them. You have felt the pain. And we can't be sure that it's over yet. We can't be sure that there's not another rate rise coming. What happens is we've got monetary policy from the Reserve Bank and we've got fiscal policy from us? The Reserve Bank of Australia have made it clear that they have got two feet firmly pressed on the brake pedal of our economy, trying to slow the economy down so they can take pressure off interest rates so that families' mortgage payments can start tracking down. They're trying to get inflation back into that two to three per cent range, which we've asked them to do. Meanwhile, as you've heard openly from those on the other side, they're shovelling money into the economy by way of handouts. They're shovelling money into our economy, stimulating our economy—the very opposite of what the Reserve Bank is asking them to do. That's $315 billion worth of extra stimulus money into the economy since this government has come to office, working in the exact opposite economic contrast to what the Reserve Bank is trying to achieve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Basic fundamentals are being overlooked. I spoke earlier about the NDIS and some of the wasteful spending that's going on. We heard in the parliament more recently about the outrageous spends in the NDIS—money being spent on cars and overseas holidays. There was even some nefarious expenditure around prostitution and cash being taken out of ATMs to purchase illicit drugs. It's just unfathomable that taxpayers' funds would be used in such a way with little or no oversight by a government who claimed to be the very architects of this program. You'll hear those on the other side talk about a trillion dollars worth of debt that they inherited, but can I remind you that during COVID we put JobSeeker in place to save those businesses and to save those families. We put it in place for a period of six months. When we said we had to turn this funding off, the shadow Treasurer, the member for Rankin, said that this economy would fall off a cliff if we stopped this funding. They espoused that the only way we could save the economy from falling off a cliff was to continue to handouts, but we made the prudent decision to stop it. And what happened? The economy didn't fall off a cliff. Eventually, the nation deserves better. The nation deserves the adults back in the room when it comes to managing prudent economics of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pensioners in my electorate deserve better economic managers so that when next winter comes they don't have to make a decision as to whether or not they sit with an extra layer of clothing on. We have to fix the energy crisis, because we were told that the energy from the sun was going to be free and that the wind was going to be free, but the only thing that's happening is that power prices are going through the roof, and they will continue to do so under this government.</span>
              </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="265990" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  We are, in many ways, captives of our childhood. Childhood memories run deep, and they never leave you. Growing up when I did, I clearly remember the devastating effects of polio. I also remember the mobile X-rays deployed around suburbs to combat the scourge of TB and, to add to that, the early warnings we had about asbestos, the pictures at Wittenoom and the photographs of the service men and women exposed to incalculable risk at the Maralinga nuclear testing site. The list could go on, but the memories are clear indeed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then there's thalidomide and the photos of babies, their mothers and fathers; the shattered lives; broken futures; and pain and suffering so needlessly inflicted. I was born at a time when mothers were being told to take thalidomide. My mother had severe morning sickness, but I was lucky that, when she was pregnant with me, her obstetrician was a partner of Dr McBride and it was not prescribed to her. This is one of life's sliding-door moments, and meant that I had a healthy and successful life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story and tragedy of thalidomide is one of failure. Not by the mothers, for they did nothing wrong, and not by the fathers either. It was a failure by government and the systems that, at the time, were meant to protect them. On reflection, we have to admit that there were really no effective systems in place at all at that time. That's why this apology is so necessary. As a nation, as a community and as a parliament, we owe nothing less not only to the survivors of this tragedy but also to those who didn't survive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the mothers both past and still with us: we are sorry. To the fathers both past and still with us: we are sorry. And to the siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins both who have passed and who are still with us: we are sorry. Most importantly, we're sorry to the children who were affected by the thalidomide scourge. We failed you. For all the effects and all the incalculable ripples this tragedy has caused throughout your life, we are sorry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thalidomide must surely rank as one of the worst stories in modern health care, and to think it was only a short time ago, with many of those personally affected still with us. I am pleased that many are still here to witness and hear the national apology, for, as much as this is a tragedy, it is also a story of resilience. In addition to my apology to all of the victims, I also commend you for your resilience, for your determination, for your strength and for your bravery. I especially commend you for your bravery. It is only because of that that we have come to this day, albeit over 60 years too late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Occasionally in this place we stand united as legislators to do the right thing. Today is one of those occasions when I can say I am really proud of this parliament and the chamber. Saying sorry doesn't absolve us in any way, but it is the right thing to do. It allows us to express our collective grief at such a tragedy, and perhaps, just perhaps, it allows us to pause and think about what we can do to redouble our efforts to help the survivors and ensure that this event never happen again.</span>
