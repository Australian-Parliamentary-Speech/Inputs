              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That this House recognise the State of Palestine.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognition of Palestine is long overdue; 143 countries have already done it. Three more—Norway, Spain and Ireland—joined overnight, and today Australia must stand with them in recognising the state of Palestine. This is not just a symbolic move; it is a critical step towards peace and towards ending the slaughter that we are seeing with the invasion of Gaza right now. It is a concrete step towards peace and, as the Prime Minister of Norway said last week, 'There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical that we debate this now, just as other countries have interrupted what they have been doing to recognise Palestine now, because the scale of the slaughter and the genocide that we are witnessing is now topping 36,000 people—36,000 civilians who have been slaughtered. A health system has been destroyed. There are mass graves in hospitals, aid has been blocked and children are now dying because they do not have enough to eat or drink. We are seeing, right now, human-engineered famine that is taking a toll on a civilian population that amounts to collective punishment of these people. And it is time for countries, including Australia, to step in and do something. Just as other countries have made it a priority to recognise the state of Palestine, so should this government today, right now, by backing this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens know that recognition alone won't stop the invasion or end the occupation. We want to see the government take some real, concrete steps to put pressure on this extreme war cabinet of Benjamin Netanyahu that is subject to orders to stop genocide. We want to see an end to the two-way trade, the military trade, with Israel. We want to see sanctions imposed on this extreme war cabinet and we want to see the ambassador expelled until this slaughter ends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if you disagree with all of those measures and are unwilling to take those steps to bring about some practical pressure on this extreme war cabinet of Benjamin Netanyahu, you can still support this motion because this motion says very simply, 'This House will recognise the state of Palestine,' and join the majority of other countries around the world that do the same. Labor promised people before the election that it would do this. Labor promised people that it would do the exact words in this motion. So now at stake is also something that needs to be resolved today, namely: whether, when it comes to the push for peace, people can believe that Labor will do what they say. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I notice in the last couple of days that Labor have said that they support a two-state solution. You can't support a two-state solution if you recognise only one side of it. What is becoming crystal clear is that Labor's words are just a fig leaf for saying that something might happen in the future while they back now the destruction of the conditions that would allow a Palestinian state to survive and thrive. Labor's empty words are a hope that something might be done in the future, while Labor backs to the hilt a genocidal war that is destroying the possibility of a state of Palestine. Instead what has happened, despite them taking to the election a promise to say that they would recognise Palestine, Labor has stood with the extreme Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu, together with its ministers, who've dehumanised the Palestinians and called for the erasure of their territory. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has stood by as settlements have been built, with over 400,000 settlers in the West Bank, in what is meant to be Palestinian territory and part of a Palestinian state. Labor has stood by as checkpoints have been built and roads that Palestinians aren't able to use have been constructed that divide their country into Bantustans, where they are unable to exercise effective self-government. Meanwhile, Labor has backed the invasion in Gaza that has seen a health system destroyed, a human engineered famine and the majority of people's homes in that region be razed to the ground. Labor has backed every single step that has been taken by this extreme Netanyahu government to destroy the conditions of a two-state solution. I say to Labor here, now, 'This is urgent, because if you really believe what you are saying about recognising the state of Palestine, then you would stop backing the invasion, you would recognise Palestine now and you would take steps against this extreme Israeli government that is conducting a genocide, instead of backing them to the hilt.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognition—what this motion is about is recognition and recognition only. This isn't just a political question; it is a deeply moral question as well, because the people of Palestine have endured displacement and suffering for far too long. This motion is about saying, 'The values that we hold dear, the right to live in freedom and exercise self-determination and to wake up every day thinking about how am I going to make my life better rather than how am I going to avoid another bomb that is going to fall on me.' Those simple values about wanting to live in peace and security—this is about saying those values should be enjoyed equally by everyone around the world. Those values of peace and security and self-determination should be enjoyed equally by Palestinians and Israelis alike. This is about saying, as a matter of morality, 'We will not stand by as others' rights to self-determination and to live in peace and security and freedom are destroyed.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will come a time when people look back at this horrific invasion and ask, 'How did we let it happen?' And when they do, they will look at what was said in this chamber, they will look at how every member of this chamber voted and they will look at the actions that took place. There will be no hiding. The history books will not lie. At the moment, what they will see is every Labor and Liberal member voting together to support the invasion, against the calls of the United Nations and humanitarian groups around the world. They will see Labor and Liberal continuing to say that this is about Israel's right to defend itself, when everyone is saying those actions have now exceeded and gone far beyond that and are amounting to collective punishment of civilians. They will see Labor defunding UNWRA—critical funding to Palestinians—right when it was needed most, and they will see Labor doing little more than offering stern words, even after Israel's military attacked Rafah, having been ordered by the International Court of Justice not to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even after the International Court of Justice said, 'Don't invade Rafah,' all that Labor can do is offer hand-wringing tweets, continue the trade with Israel and continue to act as if nothing happened. Well, genocide and war crimes happen when the perpetrators think there are going to be no consequences, when they think governments around the world will stand by, do nothing and continue to actively back their invasion. Hand-wringing tweets from this government are no longer good enough. It is time for the government to take action, and it can start by recognising the state of Palestine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The best time to have stopped this horrific invasion was eight months ago, but the next best time is now. There is a reason other countries around the world, right now, today, are shifting their positions to recognise the state of Palestine. Australia should join them. Labor promised at the election that they would do that and, if they believe even a 10th of what they say, they should vote for this motion so that this House, today, recognises the state of Palestine.</span>

At the very least, this government should recognise the state of Palestine. Really, the question is: what is the red line for Labor when it comes to Israel's genocide in Gaza? How many kids does Israel have to burn alive before Labor will literally take any action against Israel? What will it take for it to stop giving public money to Israeli weapons companies? What will it take for it to stop sending arms and ammunition to Israel?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">People are seen crouching over the body bags, with some caressing their loved one's lifeless bodies. At least one baby's head can be seen sticking out of a bag, as the woman beside it shouts: "My whole family has perished."</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what's most remarkable about the reactions from members on either side in this House is the lack of responsibility. In response to the speech of the member for Melbourne, the Leader of the Australian Greens, we sat here and heard: 'Oh, no. The government doesn't back the invasion of Gaza. No. No. We don't do any of that.' Well, take some responsibility. You are the government. You signed a $917 million weapons contract with Elbit Systems in February this year. The CEO of Elbit Systems, the blacklisted Israeli weapons company, has said recently, 'We have seen increased interest in our weapons recently because they're in operational use in Gaza'—as in killing Palestinians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In February this year, you allowed for $1.5 million worth of arms and ammunition to be sent to Israel. And you say, 'Oh, no. That didn't happen'! It's from the government's own data. There are other countries that can expel ambassadors when countries engage in genocide, but, no, there's nothing here. Those are actions that this government could take. You could recognise the state of Palestine, and you sit here and pretend that you have no power. Let's be real about this: every time Israel massacre civilians and burn children alive, they look around the world and wait for the consequences—and none come from governments like Australia. That's why they know they can get away with it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Melbourne said, history will remember people in this place and what they did. They'll ask, 'What did you do when there was a massacre and a genocide going on in Gaza, when mothers and fathers held the lifeless bodies of their children in their hands who had starved to death because they had run out of energy to breathe as a result of Israel's engineered famine?' They'll ask: 'What did you do? What did you do in this place?' It's remarkable—I'm sure we're going to hear some members in this place get up after this and talk about social cohesion, and they're going to say words like, 'We want to oppose the invasion of Rafah.' Well, sending weapons to Israel, sending money—</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Speaker—members of this place who are from the Labor Party, who are complicit in this genocide in Gaza. It is genuinely remarkable. There is more passion in this place from members of the Labor Party about defending their own reputation than there is in this place about the murder of 35,000 Palestinians. Let's be real about this. You know what's affecting social cohesion? An Australian government sending arms and weapons and ammunition, and trading in arms with a country carrying out a genocide that sees people starved to death, lose the energy to breathe and burnt alive, and mothers and fathers losing their children.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:16</span>):  The member for Melbourne knows very well that he is not moving a motion today to recognise Palestine; he is moving a procedural motion about not dealing with the parliament's agenda. The member for Melbourne knows full well that procedural motions like this are always opposed. Why he would be deliberately setting up a vote on Palestinian recognition to fail is something only he can answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens party had an opportunity to select this motion for debate at an allocated time on Monday but chose not to; only the Greens leader can explain the reason. The foreign minister, Penny Wong, has made clear statements in the last month about the government's approach to Palestinian recognition. The Greens are trying to exploit the war for votes. Simplistic wedge motions in the House do nothing to advance the cause of peace. Wedge politics only divides the community. We gain nothing from the Greens seeking to reproduce this conflict in our own community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If they were sincere the Greens would have something of substance to say about ending the cycle of violence and achieving lasting peace. Anyone who is serious about peace knows that that requires a two-state solution—a Palestinian state alongside the state of Israel. But the Greens aren't serious. They prefer slogans to policy. A two-state solution requires working together and the recognition of each other. It requires a maturity the Greens do not have. They're just doing the same thing the Liberal Party is doing and playing politics over the war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the question of recognition, we have made clear we will be guided by whether recognition will advance the cause for peace. Like many countries, Australia has been frustrated by the lack of progress in this regard. Like Germany and the UK, staunch friends of Israel, Australia no longer sees recognition as only occurring at the end of the process; it could occur as part of a peace process and once there is progress on serious governance reforms and security concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hamas is a terrorist organisation. We see no role for them in this. A Palestinian state cannot be in a position to threaten Israel's security. We want to see a reformed Palestinian governing authority that is committed to peace, disavows violence and is ready to engage in a meaningful peace process. We want to see a commitment to peace in how the Palestinian Authority leads its people. The final status of core issues such as Jerusalem and the borders of a future Palestinian state should be defined through direct negotiations. The 19 April G7 statement noted that the recognition of a Palestinian state at an appropriate time would be a crucial component of that political process. The Greens and the opposition should stop picking fights and be a part of a discussion that the whole world is grappling with, which is how we advance lasting peace through a two-state solution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, in contrast to those playing domestic political games in this chamber, the international community is taking a serious approach on this. The overwhelming majority of international community—some 143 countries, including Australia—voted for a resolution on this in the UN General Assembly recently. That motion retained the observer status of the Palestinian mission with the extension of some modest additional rights to participate in UN forums. It did not give the Palestinian mission membership at the UN or voting rights at the General Assembly, but, consistent with a two-state solution, it did express the General Assembly's aspiration for Palestinian membership in the UN, noting that this must ultimately be recommended by the Security Council, consistent with the UN charter. It did reaffirm the international community's unwavering support for the two-state solution of Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security within recognised borders—something the Leader of the Greens was unable to do on the weekend. That resolution, in that respect, was a clear rejection of the goals and methods of Hamas. A two-state solution—Israel and Palestine—is the opposite of what Hamas wants. Hamas does not want peace. This rejection of Hamas was one of the reasons Australia voted for the resolution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like with many countries, this vote didn't represent bilateral recognition on Australia's part, but the international community is engaged seriously with this issue. Let's have a look at what our international partners—what other, like-minded countries in the world—did with respect to this motion. Almost all of our region and many of our closest partners voted yes for this UN resolution, including our ally New Zealand; our special strategic partner Japan; our comprehensive strategic partners Indonesia, Singapore and the Republic of Korea; and every ASEAN nation. Like Australia, New Zealand voted yes. It considered a resolution a positive step on a pathway towards an eventual two-state solution. For Singapore, our close regional partner, their explanation of vote stated:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… Singapore's support for this resolution is a vote in favour of a negotiated two-state solution at a critical juncture in a very troubled region.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… Japan also voted in favor of the General Assembly's resolution that grants Palestine additional rights as an Observer State on the understanding that these rights are not inconsistent with the framework of the UN Charter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Kingdom has said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Setting out a horizon for a Palestinian state should be one of the vital conditions for moving from a pause in the fighting to a sustainable ceasefire.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lord Cameron has said they will look at the issue of recognising a Palestinian state, including at the United Nations, and has said that this 'could make the two-state solution irreversible'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this didn't constitute bilateral recognition on Australia's part. We've said that we need to see a reformed Palestinian governing authority that's committed to peace, that disavows violence and that is ready to engage in a meaningful peace process. We want to see a commitment to peace in how the Palestinian Authority leads its people. We want to see a reformed Palestinian Authority capable of representing the entire occupied Palestinian territories. At the same time, Israel cannot continue to take unilateral action to entrench the occupation and to prevent a viable Palestinian state.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:23</span>):  I oppose this suspension of standing orders. This is the wrong motion at the wrong time moved by the wrong people. This will do nothing to change the situation on the ground in the Middle East and it will not do anything beneficial to social cohesion in this country. The coalition supports a two-state solution in the Middle East, but we are opposed to the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. A Palestinian state should only be recognised by Australia after a peace agreement has been reached with Israel after negotiations have been concluded on the ground. Key to that recognition is for Palestinian leaders to recognise Israel's inherent right to exist, which many of them simply don't. The member for Melbourne's motion undermines the work of peacemakers on the ground and rewards those who choose violence over negotiation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion comes at a time that sends a message that Hamas's violent terrorist attacks—its murders, its abductions, its gang rapes, its dismemberment of innocent children and its torture of people—should somehow be rewarded. This motion means recognising a Palestinian state when Palestinian leaders continue to refuse to recognise Israel's right to exist. This motion means recognising a Palestinian state when Hamas still has not released 130 Israeli hostages. This motion runs contrary to the traditions of Australian foreign policy. Australia simply doesn't recognise countries that have yet to come into existence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In some respects this Greens motion shouldn't amaze me, but it does. Why is a party that spends so much time talking about the rights of women and LGBTI people so keen to advocate for the cause of organisations like Hamas, which are among the greatest abusers of women and LGBTI people in the world? But the Greens are content to ignore these inconvenient facts. We shouldn't be surprised by the Greens' actions—they've got a terrible history when it comes to antisemitism. They've got no moral courage and they repeatedly fail to stand with our Western, liberal, democratic allies. Antisemitism has become a central plank of Greens philosophy. Every time the Greens have had the chance to stand with the Jewish community in this country, or our Western, liberal, democratic allies, they've chosen to stand against them. The Greens voted against the bipartisan motion in this House that condemned the 7 October terror attacks even before Israel had begun its operations in Gaza. They voted against a bipartisan motion in the Senate last week condemning antisemitic chants at universities. The federal Greens have refused to condemn Jenny Leong for her comments that Jews have tentacles and that Jews shouldn't be able to participate in the public life of this country. On <span style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nsiders</span>, the Greens leader couldn't bring himself to clearly say that he thought Hamas was a terrorist organisation. Similarly, when directly asked whether he supports the idea of a Jewish state, he refused to answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people in this country vote for the Greens because they think they're a party of environmentalists, but their actions in this place show they're more interested in rewarding terrorists than in protecting the environment. Of the nine suspensions of standing orders the Greens have moved since 7 October, only a third relate to the environment, while more than 55 per cent— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economy, our livelihood and our wellbeing all depend on the health of our natural world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are delivering more than ever on programs, projects, policies and on-ground activities to create that nature-positive Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want a country in which nature is being repaired and is regenerating rather than continuing to decline.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last federal election, Labor made a promise to establish an environment protection agency to ensure compliance with environmental laws, to improve processes for business and, with Environment Information Australia, to centralise data collection and analysis so there is consistent and reliable information on the state of the environment across the country—to inform decision-making and track our progress against our environmental goals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everybody agrees that the current regulatory system doesn't work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We said we will fix our laws so they're less bureaucratic and provide more certainty for business and so that they improve nature, protect our unique native plants and animals and prevent extinctions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the community expects and that's what we're delivering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had hundreds of hours of consultations with more than 100 representative groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've held public webinars that around 3,000 people have attended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have received around 2,500 submissions from people and groups passionate about these laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are consulting extensively and comprehensively. That is the mature way to develop good policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have taken the advice of Professor Graeme Samuel, commissioned by the former government to report on how the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act could be improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've already completed the first stage of reform. In late 2023, we passed legislation to establish the world's first national Nature Repair Market and expanded the water trigger to apply to all unconventional gas projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're now moving quickly to establish an environment protection agency and Environment Information Australia. These are crucial elements of our plans to create a nature positive Australia, and we want to get them in place as soon as possible—so they can begin their important work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will keep working on the remainder of our reforms outlined in the Nature Positive Plan so we can get them into the parliament and passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Combined with significant additional funding, this stage of the reforms will deliver stronger environmental powers, faster environmental approvals, more environment information and greater transparency. These are big steps forward, for the environment and for business, and it's all new under this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Environment Protection Australia, our EPA, is an important part of delivering the government's Nature Positive Plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Staging the rollout will mean that some of the teething problems which often occur in setting up new agencies like EPA from scratch will be dealt with before they are being asked to administer a whole new set of environmental laws. It allows a smoother transition of responsibilities from the current department to the new agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are establishing Australia's first national independent environment protection agency with strong new powers and penalties to better protect nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">EPA would administer Australia's national environmental laws to better protect our environment and make faster, clearer decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be charged with delivering accountable, efficient, outcome-focused and transparent environmental regulatory decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">EPA would be a truly national environmental regulator that Australians can be proud of, responsible for a wide range of activities under Australia's environment laws, including in relation to recycling and waste exports, hazardous waste, sea dumping, ozone protection, underwater cultural heritage and air quality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This independent agency's work would include regulatory work, such as issuing permits and licences and undertaking compliance and enforcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would play an important role in educating industry, business and the community to help them navigate our environmental laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By providing better guidance and education, we can make sure businesses are clear about the rules, so they can do the right thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're investing in our people, our planning and our systems, to speed up development decisions—to deliver quicker yeses and—when necessary—quicker noes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">EPA would be the tough cop on the beat, enforcing our laws through new monitoring, compliance and enforcement powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Samuel review into Australia's environment laws found that the regulator is not fulfilling this necessary function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Samuel also found that serious enforcement actions are rarely used and that penalties need to be more than just the cost of doing business. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our audit of environmental offsets echoes this shameful tale. It tells us that the current system is not working.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Preventing harm and checking and enforcing requirements is one of the most important things we can do to protect nature. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, if a project proponent promises to provide an offset to make up for an unavoidable impact on nature, the public should be confident that that promise will be kept. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our bills respond to those findings of both the Samuel review and the offsets audit, while we continue to work on the rest of our environmental law reforms. Stage 3 of our reforms will continue our broader efforts to halt and reverse environmental decline and protect nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">EPA would deliver proportionate and effective risk-based compliance and enforcement actions, using high-quality data and information. It would provide assurance that environmental outcomes are being met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most businesses do the right thing. We know that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But when penalties for breaking the law are too low, and the risk of being caught is negligible, some companies or individuals regard breaking the law as an acceptable risk, an acceptable cost of doing business. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we're increasing penalties, too. For extremely serious breaches of federal environment law, courts would be able to impose penalties of up to $780 million in some circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only individuals or corporations deliberately doing the wrong thing need to fear these penalties. These are the maximum penalties available. A court would still maintain discretion in deciding what penalty to impose in each case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">EPA would be able to issue environment protection orders—or 'stop-work' orders—to address or prevent imminent risks of serious damage to protected matters in urgent circumstances. EPA would also be able to audit businesses to ensure they are compliant with environment approval conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Creating EPA would promote public trust in environmental decision-making through publication of information, transparency of decisions and providing opportunities for the community, including First Nations people, to inform decision-making processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were clear in our Nature Positive Plan that our EPA would be independent—the first national, independent EPA in this country—that it would have its own budget and that it would be led by a chief executive officer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill delivers that. It establishes EPA in legislation as an independent statutory agency, separate from the environment department and the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Nature Positive Plan, we committed to provide the public with easier access to up-to-date environmental data, to make high-quality data and information publicly available and to increase transparency and public accountability on matters affecting the environment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill establishes the head of Environment Information Australia: an independent position with a legislative mandate to provide environmental data and information to Environment Protection Australia, the minister, and the public; an independent position to transparently report on trends in the environment. This will support actions and decisions to halt and reverse the decline, and in turn protect and restore nature—charged with working in collaboration with Australia's experts, scientists, and First Nations people to collect information and produce consistent tracking of the state of Australia's environment, and charged with leading Environment Information Australia, a division in the Department of Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A nature-positive Australia is good for the economy, for livelihoods and for our wellbeing. But achieving a nature-positive Australia relies on good-quality and useful environmental information—information to inform investment, policy and regulatory decisions by government, the private sector, community groups, academics and scientists, and philanthropic groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that national environment information and data is fragmented. Its quality is uncertain, and what is available is not readily accessible and usable. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through its public portal, the head of EIA will be a source of the best available, verified environmental information—a consistent and reliable resource for business, enabling better site choices to avoid removing high-value habitat for our unique plants and animals. When project proponents are more easily able to select sites which minimise impacts on nature, projects can be approved more easily and completed more quickly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A consistent and reliable source of environmental reporting will mean that no Australian government can hide the truth about the state of our environment—like the previous government did.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Environment data and information comes from a variety of sources. There are a lot of organisations doing great work to further our understanding of nature. The head of EIA will form partnerships with government and non-government organisations with a shared purpose of making data better, easier to access, and more useful. This includes partnering with state and territory government organisations to provide a rich national picture of the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The head of EIA will also gather information relevant to the minister and the functions of the CEO of Environment Protection Australia. Our improved information and data will underpin faster, clearer decision-making. It will also avoid the need to collect and provide the same data over and over again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that there are good reasons why certain information and data should not be made publicly available. Our bill balances the need to make more information public, while protecting information where the public release of it could cause harm—for example, to individuals, businesses, critically endangered species, or for cultural reasons. It applies protections on the use and disclosure of sensitive information to individuals but allows information essential to inform Environment Protection Australia's decision-making to flow between it and the head of EIA.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The head of EIA will establish an integrated and robust reporting framework to monitor the impact of environmental actions and decisions. This was a key recommendation of the Samuel review. It delivers on our promise at the last election to provide consistent and reliable information on the state of the environment across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also defines, for the first time, the term 'nature positive' and introduces a requirement to report on Australia's national progress towards that outcome. This will be the first time that any country has defined 'nature positive' in legislation and put in place national reporting against this objective. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, 'nature positive' means improving our ecosystems, including the species that rely on, and form part of, an ecosystem. Creating a nature-positive Australia means that, across Australia, nature is repairing rather than continuing to decline. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The head of the EIA will be charged with developing and implementing a monitoring, evaluation and reporting framework to report on nature positive, including setting a baseline.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That this bill be now read a second time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is working for all Australians, and with our measures in this year's budget we are providing responsible cost-of-living relief that eases pressure on people and doesn't add to inflation. The measures in the bill I am introducing today are complemented by our new power bill relief, cheaper medicines, the extended freeze on social security deeming rates, strengthening Medicare and, of course, the delivery of a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer on 1 July this year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (More Support in the Safety Net) Bill 2024 is part of this broader plan and delivers targeted assistance to further strengthen Australia's social security safety net. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It builds on the government's safety net measures in the last budget, which increased working-age and student payments by $40 a fortnight, expanded eligibility for the higher rate of JobSeeker, expanded parenting payment single to parents until their youngest child turns 14 and increased the maximum rate of Commonwealth rent assistance by 15 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Together with last year's investments, the measures in this bill represent an additional $11.5 billion investment in the social security system, providing more assistance to Australians on some of the lowest incomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2024-25 alone, it is estimated that over $143 billion will be spent on social security and family payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government knows that access to secure and affordable housing has significant social, economic and personal benefits. And, in the current context, we recognise many people are still struggling with high rental costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why, as part of this bill, the government will increase Commonwealth rent assistance maximum rates by a further 10 per cent, providing recipients with more support to manage rental pressures. This builds on our increase in the previous budget, providing the first back-to-back increases to rent assistance in over 30 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This further increase means that, combined with the indexation, by 20 September 2024, when this measure is due to commence, maximum rates of rent assistance will have increased by over 40 per cent since the Albanese government was elected in May 2022. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And regular indexation will be applied on top, on the same day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rental assistance is the most effective policy lever the government has to target and provide immediate assistance for low-income households in private rentals. This latest measure will help address the pressure associated with housing costs for close to a million households.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second measure delivered by this bill will extend eligibility for the higher rate of JobSeeker to single recipients who have been assessed as only being able to work up to 14 hours per week due to a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment. This higher rate is currently $816.90 per fortnight and goes to single recipients with dependent children and single recipients aged 55 and over on payment for nine or more continuous months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this measure, additional assistance will be targeted to recipients with a significantly reduced capacity to work, recognising the barriers they face to supplement their income with earnings from work and the financial strain this can create.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure will bring around 4,700 additional recipients onto the higher rate of the JobSeeker payment, better reflecting their needs and circumstances and supporting them with their daily living costs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On average, recipients with a partial capacity to work of up to 14 hours remain on payment for almost twice as long as those without a partial capacity to work and are less likely to experience the benefit of work, with only nine per cent reporting earnings on average each fortnight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of those who will benefit from this measure, 36 per cent are women, 34 per cent live in regional and remote Australia and 14 per cent are First Nations people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Combined with a higher rate of energy supplement, these recipients will receive an additional $54.90 per fortnight before indexation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Subject to the passage of this bill, this measure will commence from 20 September 2024. This is the same day as regular indexation of the JobSeeker payment, which means the actual increase will be higher.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure builds on our changes to payments in the last budget, including the $40 per fortnight base rate increase for working age and student payments and extending the higher rate of the JobSeeker payment to single Australians aged 55 and over who have been on the payment long term, down from 60.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Expanding eligibility for the higher JobSeeker rate to these cohorts is designed to strengthen the system, by better targeting support to people based on their age, stage and circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the government was elected in May 2022, the base rate of the JobSeeker payment has increased by $120 per fortnight, or 18.7 per cent, providing over $3,100 in additional support each year. This is the largest nominal increase in a two-year period ever and the largest two-year increase in real terms, 7.4 per cent, in more than 40 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And for those cohorts moving from the base rate to the higher rate, they are over $4,500 a year better off since May 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside this targeted increase in income support, the government remains committed to our workforce participation agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third measure of this bill—to introduce more flexibility for carer payment recipients to manage their work commitments and caring responsibilities—aligns with the government's road map in the employment white paper to remove barriers to employment and improve workforce participation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This includes provisions to change the 25-hour-per-week participation limit for carer payment recipients to instead allow up to 100 hours over a four-week settlement period, effective from 20 March 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changes will also be made to ensure education and volunteering activities will no longer be counted in the participation limit. Travel time will also be removed through related policy changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the carer payment can be cancelled if the 25-hour limit per week is exceeded. As well as greater flexibility, this measure also introduces a six-month suspension period for recipients who work over the new flexible limit, meaning if their circumstances change they won't need to reapply to access the carer payment. They will also retain their pensioner concession card during this period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Policy changes will also provide for the use of single temporary cessation-of-care days, providing for one-off or occasional instances of exceeding the participation hours limit. Currently, carers receive 63 of these respite days—which they can use for any purpose. But they are required to use them in seven-day blocks where these days are used to cover instances exceeding the participation limit. This change means that they can opt to use only a single day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Combined, these changes are designed to give carers—who are predominantly women—greater flexibility and choice to structure their work, study or volunteering commitments around their caring responsibilities. This is expected to particularly benefit people who care for those with episodic or fluctuating conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The removal of travel time from the participation limit will particularly assist carers who live in regional and remote areas and are more likely to need to travel further for work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 31,000 carer payment recipients currently report employment earnings and may benefit from these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure responds to recommendations in the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee's 2024 report and the 2020 Productivity Commission inquiry into mental health. The changes have also been called for by stakeholders, advocacy groups and recipients of carer payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Combined with a higher rate of Energy Supplement, a single JobSeeker payment recipient with a capacity to work of less than 15 hours per week, will receive at least an additional $54.90 per fortnight in support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">A single person with three children receiving the maximum rate of Commonwealth rent assistance will receive an additional $25.06 per fortnight in rent assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">A single JobSeeker payment recipient who has been assessed as having a partial capacity to work of less than 15 hours, living alone, and receives the maximum rate of Commonwealth rent assistance, can receive at least an additional $73.70 per fortnight in total.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">A carer payment recipient is now able to take up work more flexibly to suit their caring needs and participate in study or volunteering to set up employment opportunities once their caring obligations cease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures provide responsible relief, including to some of the most vulnerable in our community, and help to remove barriers to work for carers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government believe in a strong and sustainable social security system and, with these measures, we are providing more support in the safety net.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the 2022 election, Labor committed to improving payment times to small businesses, emphasising that payments to small businesses should be made within 30 days or less.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of delivering on that commitment, the government commissioned Dr Craig Emerson to undertake a review of the Payment Times Reporting Act 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why this bill overhauls the Payment Times Reporting Act 2020, to level the playing field and encourage large businesses to treat their small-business suppliers fairly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For small businesses who supply goods and services to large companies, it's simply unfair for those big corporations to delay paying the invoice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's simply unthinkable, just as it should be unthinkable for big businesses to create long delays when paying their small business suppliers. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Emerson's review found that, while the Payment Times Reporting Scheme has merit, certain requirements in the act imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on reporting entities compromise the effectiveness of the regulator and limit the accuracy and accessibility of the data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Assignment of Medicare Benefits) Bill 2024 represents more progress on the government's commitment to strengthen Medicare for the needs of modern Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will make critically needed improvements to make it easier for GPs and health professionals to bulk-bill their patients, by updating the assignment-of-benefit process which underpins bulk-billed Medicare services and simplified billing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will modernise the assignment-of-benefits process, bring it into the 21st century and help to further safeguard Medicare from fraud. This upgrade has been sorely needed for many years now. GPs have long complained of an overly complex and onerous paperwork process that is inefficient and holds back productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming into government, we've invested in measures to help GPs and health professionals deliver the care Australians need. Stopping the slide in the bulk-billing rate has been front of mind, and our record investment into bulk-billing in last year's budget has succeeded in that effort, leading to increased bulk-billing in every state and territory across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to do everything we can to make it easier for patients to be bulk-billed and support Australians' access to timely and affordable health care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also address simplified billing, which relates to assignments by patients who are privately insured, for hospital or hospital-substitute treatment that is covered by their policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In both cases the assignment of benefit enables the right to payment of a Medicare benefit, which is payable for eligible patients, to be transferred to healthcare providers in exchange for zero or low out-of-pocket expenses for the patient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are required to protect the integrity of Medicare payments and to reduce the administrative burden of regulatory compliance. The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), in its 2022-23 expansion of telehealth report, also identified the potential incompatibility of 'verbal assignment' for bulk-billed telehealth services with current legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will support the government's ongoing commitment to bulk-billing, complementing the $3.5 billion measure to triple bulk-billing incentives in the 2023-24 budget, and maintain simplified billing to reduce or eliminate out-of-pocket costs for privately insured patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modernising and making assignment of benefit easier for patients and providers will preserve goodwill toward and trust of the Medicare program in its 40th year and beyond.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to industry feedback, amendments under this bill streamline bulk billing and simplified billing processes. The bill goes further than telehealth, as the amendments reform assignment of benefit broadly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One aspect of the bill is to support more efficient and effective claiming processes (including use of digital technologies) and provide for appropriate protections to ensure the integrity of Medicare for future generations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current requirement for an 'approved form' would be replaced with requirements prescribed in regulations, enabling digital solutions that give government and stakeholders the flexibility to leverage existing interactions with patients, such as appointment booking, patient registration, hospital admission processes and informed financial consent discussions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For simplified billing, where health insurers and approved billing agents manage claims for patients receiving hospital and hospital-substitute treatment, the bill will make use of health insurance coverage including insurer agreements with hospitals and 'no gap' or 'known gap' arrangements with practitioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifying requirements in regulations proposed to be made under the bill, subject to consideration by the Governor-General in Council, will have the benefit of futureproofing the processes and ensuring they are adaptable as technology advances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will enable a patient to assign a Medicare benefit before or after a professional service is rendered. This is a change advocated by key stakeholders, along with capability for enduring assignment agreements in some scenarios. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendments are also required to protect and reinforce the integrity of Medicare without introducing unnecessary administrative burden for stakeholders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicare payment integrity will be supported through improving the provision of information relevant to patients' understanding of their treatment and the associated costs including notifying the patient of claims for benefits. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also improve record-keeping requirements, supporting auditability. The focus will be on flexibly using information already collected by the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medical industry, hospital and private health insurance stakeholders have voiced support for the legislative changes to simplify and modernise the Health Insurance Act 1973; to improve transparency for patients while ensuring minimal administrative burden for healthcare providers and insurers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, this bill supports the Medicare Benefits Schedule and modernises and simplifies the assignment-of-benefits process to provide patients' continued access to timely and subsidised care. Amendments will improve Medicare payment integrity and benefits both patients and providers, ultimately resulting in better healthcare outcomes for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is determined to make it easier and cheaper for people to access high-quality care where and when they need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will help to deliver this and further strengthen Medicare for the needs of modern Australia.</span>

Multiple statutory reviews of the previous version of this act have found that the department's compliance activities have been inefficient and ineffective. In fact, logging of native forests in this country is not adequately supervised or monitored. Our state governments allow ongoing logging of the forests, and the federal government has not intervened to stop them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Victoria, logging is regulated by the Code of Practice for Timber Production 2014. Between 2009 and 2017, more than 300 breaches of that code were submitted to the Victorian government. None were prosecuted. In 2019, an independent report into the responsible department found that it had neither the capacity nor the capability to monitor or to regulate logging in Victoria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian state government officially ended harvesting of our state forests on 1 January 2024, but it has continued, under its Timber Utilisation Plan, in some areas. VicForests continues to remove large logs from the Wombat State Forest under the guise of debris clean-up or salvage logging, and it continues to sell that timber via its vehicle, Forest Fire Management Victoria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just two weeks ago, an endangered greater glider was killed by the Victorian department of environment in its tree-felling in the Yarra Ranges National Park. That was despite multiple warnings from the Victorian National Parks Association to multiple agencies and to the state and the federal ministers' offices about sightings of greater gliders and Leadbeater's possums in trees identified for removal. Through its agent, VicForests, the Victorian state government continues to act in active contravention of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The federal Minister for the Environment and Water has not intervened to halt the illegal actions of VicForests or to hold the Victorian environment minister to account for these activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we could do is clear. We should ban all native forest logging nationally, but, in the meantime, we can halt the sale of all timber cut as part of salvage logging of native forests. There should be no market for wood obtained in the process of logging for firebreaks and other so-called fire protection measures. We simply can't trust state or federal governments to oversee responsible use of timber from native forests. Only by abolishing those markets altogether can we stop their exploitation and abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous iteration of this act required a statutory review after five years, but this version of the bill has no requirement for regular review of the act's operation or effectiveness; rather, the bill suggests that the secretary can choose to publish reports about the operation of this act, or not, as the case may be. This contrasts with the frameworks for control of illegal logging in similar jurisdictions internationally, where timber regulation is subject to regular reviews, with reports tabled in parliament. Given that, in particular, the statutory report identified high levels of noncompliance with the previous iteration of this legislation and given the frequent egregious violations of this law domestically, this legislation has to be accompanied by regular monitoring and transparent reporting of its effectiveness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve clarity about the state and federal governments' plans for management of our native forests. We need to know that illegal logging of timber will be identified and prosecuted. We need to know that this legislation will be subject to appropriate statutory review, sufficient to provide reassurance regarding compliance, due diligence and a response to the concerns of third parties. The sad fact is that at this point we cannot trust either the state governments or the federal government to look after our native forests. We need to be able to do that in future. I therefore have moved the amendment in my name with an aim of having appropriate review of this bill in five years, and I signal to this government my commitment to further action in this area.</span>

I'm satisfied that it is reasonable and appropriate to provide an independent, five-year review of the operation of the act that could examine whether the substantial reforms contained in the act relating to sampling, auditing and notifications are operating effectively. The bill addresses the challenges identified in recent reviews of Australia's illegal logging laws and provides for measures that will strengthen the act and ensure that it is fit for purpose now and into the future. The amendments contained in the bill have been developed with a view to implementing best practice and learning from the developments with similar laws overseas. An independent review within five years will provide a further opportunity to consider whether Australia's laws continue to reflect international best practice.</span>

It also provides a clear legal basis for the payment of advice fees from superannuation and associated tax consequences. The reason we're doing this is the <span style="font-style:italic;">Quality of advice review</span> found concerns about whether there was a legal basis to pay financial advice fees out of superannuation. Let's be clear: this means that, without this legislation, millions of Australians will be unable to pay for financial advice out of superannuation. Our legislation adopts the recommendation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Quality of advice review</span> to give Australians certainty that they can pay for financial advice out of superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened to the second reading debate. Members who claim to support affordable and accessible financial advice and who claim to support the findings of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Quality of advice review</span> should be supporting this bill here and in the other place. As recommended by that review, our legislation maintains important consumer safeguards. Let me be very, very clear: there's no intent, desire or expectation that superannuation funds will need to check every statement of advice when they're paying out fees for financial advice. We've clarified this in the revised explanatory memorandum, which I've just tabled now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trustees must of course meet their longstanding obligations around the sole-purpose test and the financial interest duty. Under current practice, funds have been required to meet these obligations. Under our proposed legislation, funds will be required to meet these obligations. There is no new compliance burden on funds or advisers—none. The regulator has confirmed this; ASIC has publicly stated the expected compliance approach does not increase the course of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our changes to the explanatory memorandum make it clear that the assurance process may include, for example, random risk based sampling of advice; this is hardly an onerous burden on funds to simply maintain current practice. People who are suggesting an alternative need to explain why these important consumer safeguards should be watered down. This is also something that has real consequences. ASIC has recently released a report examining the practice of funds paying financial advice fees out of superannuation. Regrettably, ASIC still found that there were a number of circumstances in which fees for no service were discovered. This has the potential for great harm. It needs to stop immediately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why our legislation maintains important safeguards to ensure that we do not condone this behaviour. Our amendments further cut red tape by extending the flexibility of the provisions for financial services guides to general advice scenarios, and we have reinstated the exemption to the ban on conflicted remuneration in relation to certain insurance products where general advice is provided. As such, these amendments support improved access to quality, affordable financial advice for millions of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedules 2 and 3 to the bill improve the operation and integrity of the petroleum resource rent tax. Schedule 4 to the bill amends the domestic legislation governing Australia's agreements with international financial institutions to automatically incorporate amendments made to treaties between Australia and these institutions to reduce the administrative burden of updating the legislation. Schedule 5 to the bill makes minor and technical amendments to various laws in the Treasury portfolio to ensure those laws operate in accordance with policy intent. Finally, schedule 6 to the bill proposes support to the Australian film industry. It will secure Australia's global competitiveness as a destination for large-scale film productions, provide domestic training and employment opportunities in the Australian screen industry and support the continued production of iconic long-form Australian drama series. With those comments, I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  The creation of the Net Zero Economy Authority is central to our government's vision for a future made here in Australia, and it speaks for the example that drives each and every government member each and every day: no-one held back and no-one left behind. This is about making sure that no community is held back from the new jobs and opportunities of the global shift to clean energy that we are seeing, but it's also about making sure that no community is left behind by economic change. That is the responsibility of this authority, and it's a mission of this government, because we want to create a new generation of economic growth and prosperity for Australia. We are determined for our nation to seize the opportunities that are there, the clean energy to power a new era of advanced manufacturing, particularly in our regions; to make Australia a renewable energy superpower; to make the most of our comparative advantages; and to make things here again. We want to unlock all the flow-on economic benefits that that will bring—the new, secure, well-paid jobs in our regions and in our suburbs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation—the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024—is about making sure this transformative economic opportunity is shared with every Australian, town by town, worker by worker, business by business. We are living through the most significant economic change since the industrial revolution. Nations representing 92 per cent of the global economy are signed up to net zero and so are 97 per cent of Australia's trading partners. Net zero is the future of the global economy, and this legislation recognises that reality. What's more, it reflects our government's determination to shape that future rather than wait for the future to shape us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the world to reach net zero, it will need much more clean energy—solar power, wind power and green hydrogen—and it will need more of all the resources and technology that go into producing that energy—the metals, critical minerals and rare earths that Australia has in such abundance. If you could have designed a global opportunity from scratch, you could not have put Australia in a better starting position. But it is just that: a starting position. It's a foundation. We have to build the architecture. Part of that architecture is this legislation. That is what we have been doing since the first sitting week of this parliament. We legislated our emissions reduction targets for 2030. We legislated for net zero by 2050. We created the safeguard mechanism, giving business and industry the certainty to invest in reducing their emissions. We have our new vehicle efficiency standards, getting Australia up to speed with the rest of the world and giving Australian drivers more choice. There's Rewiring the Nation and our Capacity Investment Scheme, overdue investments in the national energy grid after a decade of neglect, when it was allowed to fall into disrepair. Those opposite, when they were in government during that decade of lost opportunity, had 22 separate energy policies. They just didn't land any of them. We have had one, we have landed it and we're getting on with implementing it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also rebuilding our international relationships, demonstrating that Australia's back at the table and ready to be part of the global solution, making climate and clean energy the third pillar of our alliance with the United States of America. We're strengthening our critical minerals partnership with India and maintaining our important energy partnerships with Japan and the Republic of Korea. We're signing a new green economy agreement with Singapore, with new work on green shipping. And, of course, there are the investments made in the budget earlier this month, supporting our vision for a future made in Australia. There are new incentives to drive business investment in critical minerals and hydrogen. There are production tax credits that back job creation and reward success, and we're speeding up approvals and streamlining the investment process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Authority is another key part of this architecture. It will have the responsibility and the resources to engage directly with those communities and workers who are on the front line of the shift to clean energy. In our regions in particular, this change is the work of a generation. Preparing for what is coming next, anticipating the change and shaping it in the best interests of our people, has to start right now. That is where this new authority will ensure programs and policies are coordinated at a federal level across departments as well as working with states and territories and the private sector. We'll engage directly with workers in emissions intensive industries and regions to invest in new jobs, skills and opportunities, and we'll focus on the broader community, on the schools, hospitals, infrastructure and services that are needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, if a power station is approaching its scheduled closure, we believe government has a responsibility to be there ahead of time, not wait until it's occurred, to engage with workforces, local businesses and community leaders, to be there helping workers plan their features by reskilling, training and being ready for new job opportunities. Consider the contrast between Hazelwood and Liddell. Hazelwood shut with a few months notice, and far too many workers and families were left behind. At Liddell, AGL is working to turn the site into a new energy hub for the Hunter, and our government's Solar Sunshot program is going to create new manufacturing opportunities right along the supply chain. That's an investment in our national economic resilience, it's an investment in our energy sovereignty and it's an investment in more jobs for the Hunter in the future than there were at the old power station, at that site alone. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's how you make change work for people. That's how you build community support for the transition that is occurring—not through having slogans but by having serious policies that make sure that workers and communities benefit from the change which is occurring. It is not through what we saw from those opposite—the denial and delay, closing their eyes and trying to wish the problem away. We saw that over Liddell, where week after week, month after month, year after year, the former minister Frydenberg used to stand at this dispatch box and speak about how Liddell was going to be extended into the never-never. It never happened, because it simply wasn't possible for it to happen. It had reached the end of its life. We saw it when they stood here and announced, on budget night, funding for a study for the proponents of the Collinsville coal-fired power station. It was never going to happen. It didn't stack up. It had no investors. But what it did was stop serious action. But it also wasn't honest for those people in North Queensland, just as the statements about Liddell weren't honest for the people of the Hunter Valley.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need is to have real solutions to the challenges which are there but also to seize the opportunities which are there. And we're seeing it play out again from those opposite, with their swapping of economic reality for their nuclear fantasy. It won't occur. Communities won't be looked after by pretending that somehow Australia can afford the most expensive form of new energy and the slowest to build. Last week the CSIRO confirmed that any form of nuclear reactor would not be possible in Australia until at least 2040, and the best-case scenario cost of construction for just one of the many nuclear reactors that the Leader of the Opposition keeps saying he's going to announce any day now is at least $8.6 billion, and it could easily be twice as high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that serious people such as the shadow minister at the dispatch box here have indicated that they don't want it anywhere near their electorate—in his case, Gippsland. It's one of those circumstances. You can imagine them having all of their members lined up, and they'll say, 'Please step forward, those who want a nuclear reactor in your seat,' and, one by one, they'll all take that step back, which is why the Leader of the Opposition can't announce his policy, even though his party is full of 'nuclear reactionaries'. It's not just the massive cost of building nuclear reactors or the higher cost of the energy they would produce; it's the years that we'd waste; it's the price that Australia would pay for missing the opportunities that are in front of us right now—because, make no mistake, the world isn't waiting around for us. The world is moving forward, with the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States; with similar legislation in Japan, the Republic of Korea and the European Union; and with the work that is taking place. If we stand still—or worse, if we go down the rabbit hole of nuclear reactors—then the world will go right past us. Our government is absolutely determined to make this moment count, to make our future here in Australia, and this legislation is an important part of that. I thank members of the crossbench and others who have engaged constructively, including a meeting I had yesterday with the member for Indi. She has a very sensible amendment to this legislation that she will try to progress through the parliament to ensure that there is regional representation as part of the authority's independent oversight that will occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My government is investing in the new skills, new infrastructure, new incentives and new energy which will seize the opportunities which are there before us. This legislation is about seizing those opportunities and also about sharing them, making sure that people are not left behind. This is a reform that holds no-one back and progress that leaves no-one behind. I commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  by leave—As others have said in this chamber, we have some amazing opportunities ahead of us as we transition to a net zero economy, but we know that these opportunities will not seize themselves. As the race to net zero accelerates, we must ensure Australian workers and communities are supported to play their parts. We know that there are communities in which the experience of the transition will be most concentrated, and our government knows that we must do what we can to support these communities and all those that live in them. We know the government has a critical role to play. That role is to coordinate programs and policies to attract investors and help communities make the most of the transformation opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is uniquely positioned to become a renewable energy superpower in the future net zero global economy. As a nation, we have an abundance of renewable energy sources and, as home to every metal and critical mineral essential to net zero technologies, it would be negligent not to take advantage of our natural assets in a competitive global economy. This is, of course, why our government is taking the opportunity and responsibility incredibly seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really proud to be part of a government that wants to seize the opportunity presented, and the Net Zero Economy Authority is a key part of the plan to do this. Its job is to ensure we are looking after Australia's workers and regions as we transform from a fossil fuel based economy to a renewable energy superpower. This recognises that the way we navigate economic change is as important as reaching the destination of a net zero economy. The authority will, on behalf of government, be a partner with industry and investors in getting big, transformational projects happening. Importantly, the authority will support workers through the change. As Australia's ageing fleet of power stations retires, the authority will take a collaborative and consultative approach in working with employers, unions and others to support workers into new opportunities. This is not just the right thing to do by workers; it also ensures we're making good use of the highly skilled workers we need more of in the net zero economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority will also play an important role in helping communities navigate this change, especially in those regions where change may be significant. This new authority, with its focus on managing economic change, complements over $40 billion in government initiatives to reduce emissions and become a renewable energy superpower. These include the $20 billion Rewiring the Nation program to modernise our electricity grid and infrastructure so they can support our renewable energy based system, the $1.9 billion Powering the Regions Fund to support the decarbonisation of existing industries and the creation of new clean-energy industries, the $6 billion critical minerals facility to grow our critical minerals production sector, the $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program supporting development of large-scale renewable hydrogen projects and, of course, our government's $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund to help diversity and transform Australia's industry for a net zero economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority will ensure workers receive the support they need to make the most of the opportunities here and in the future, working with employers, unions and others. As part of this, the bill will establish the legislative framework for the Energy Industry Jobs Plan. Administered by the authority, the plan will enable the use of pooled redeployment arrangements. These will support workers in closing coal-fired power stations and closing gas-fired generators and their dependent suppliers to transition directly to a new job. Workers in a closing facility will have opportunities to be redeployed into a new job with another employer in the same or similar industry. Closing or dependent employers will be encouraged to participate voluntarily.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point, I want to reflect on my previous work with workers in industries where there had been disruption and displacement. I know how difficult many of those workers found obtaining good, well-paid, secure jobs, so it's really important—and I'm really proud—that our government is taking this really positive step to set up the Net Zero Economy Authority to ensure that no workers are left behind as our economy transitions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our largest coal-fired power stations are run by mature corporations. They often have strong plans in place to support their workforce as they prepare for closures. Indeed, we expect many of them to put their hand up to participate in the Energy Industry Jobs Plan. Notwithstanding that, the bill provides the Fair Work Commission with powers to require their participation as a fail-safe to make sure the transition is orderly. It enlivens enforceable obligations for those closing employers to provide transitional support to their employees subject to operational requirements. The authority would encourage receiving employers to participate voluntarily. Those receiving employers that put their hand up will be in pole position to grab highly skilled and experienced workers. This community of interested employers will give workers the greatest opportunity to secure alternative employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed model for the plan reflects the outcomes of detailed consultations with employee and employer groups. This is all about supporting workers on the front line of the energy transition and supporting businesses to access the skills and experience that they value. Helping workers and their families stay in place helps communities stay whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a functional level, the Net Zero Economy Authority will promote orderly and positive economic transformation as the world decarbonises. The authority will do this by helping to facilitate the achievement of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and, in doing so, assist Australia's transformation to a renewable energy superpower. We'll also seek to ensure Australia's regions and workers are supported through and benefit from the associated economic transformation as we seek to transition our economy in a considered and sustainable manner.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is going to be one of the most significant economic shifts we've seen since the Industrial Revolution, as previous speakers, including the Prime Minister, have said in this chamber. The scale and significance of global efforts to reduce emissions will absolutely transform industries and economies. While currently an emissions-intensive economy, Australia's net zero transformation will lead to significant economic and workforce transition. While this transition is important, it's important to also look at the opportunities that communities are going to receive as a result of that transition through the industry jobs plan and through the guarantees there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know we need to engage stakeholders widely. We've had broad support through our consultation process. Indeed, Jennifer Westacott, the former Business Council chief executive, described this as an opportunity for better jobs and better living standards. Steve Murphy, the National Secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, explained that this delivers on a promise. That's what our government is doing and what this bill will do—making sure, when we're moving into a net zero economy, as our industries are transforming and transitioning, that we're not leaving communities behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that many in my own community of Chisholm are really passionate about the positive steps our government is taking to move into a net zero economy. I want to acknowledge some of the local groups that are making a positive difference for the environment locally and are fierce advocates for a carbon-zero future. These groups include Baby Boomers for Climate Change Action, the Australian Conservation Foundation Chisholm Group, the KooyongKoot Alliance, the Friends of Scotchmans Creek and Valley Reserve and the Friends of Damper Creek Conservation Reserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that Australia's future is in renewable energy and that there are enormous opportunities that we as a nation can seize. I'm proud of our government's reliable renewables plan, which will deliver 82 per cent renewables by 2030. I'm proud to be part of a government that will, through this bill, help position this nation and our communities to take advantage of the opportunities that a transition to a net zero economy offers us. I'm really proud that, in that transition, we will support workers and industry and make sure that no community is left behind through positive and necessary generational change.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WATSON-BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  It feels a bit like some kind of sick joke, doesn't it, that in the same fortnight the Minister for Resources announced the future gas strategy the government put up this legislation, the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024, on Australia's path to net zero? Let me be clear: these two things are mutually exclusive. Australia has no real path to net zero, not under this government. The future gas strategy destroys any path to net zero. This government wilfully embraces the gas cartels, announcing more gas exploration despite the looming climate catastrophe. The government says that gas is a transition fuel—but to where? Not to net zero. If they keep rolling out the red carpet for gas projects, the transition will be to climate disaster. Labor are climate con artists. They are literally gaslighting everyday Australians, completely greenwashing their legislative agenda and at the expense of a real transition for coal and gas workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are the only party pushing for a statutory authority to support all coal and gas workers through the transition to renewables. This is not that authority. At the crux of it, this legislation covers only 10 per cent of the workforce affected by any transition to net zero. It only relates to employees of coal and gas-fired power stations and coalmines supplying domestic power generation. There's nothing about gas and oil export workers. Labor says, 'Bad luck!' if you're one of the 90 per cent of workers this bill just doesn't cover. It's because the Labor government has no desire to offer up a real transition plan. That's explicitly clear with the decision to exclude coal and gas export workers from this bill. This is a shameless reflection of Labor's plan to continue expanding coal and gas beyond 2050, such as the Barossa project, which, in the next 12 months, will emit more than 401 million tonnes of CO2 pollution. That's 80 per cent of the total pollution of Australia in just 2020 alone. What about the Scarborough offshore gas field? That's another devastating project, this one brought to us by another member of the gas cartel, Woodside. This project will produce emissions equivalent to six coal-fired power plants over its lifetime. The Scarborough-to-Pluto project will emit over 1.37 billion tonnes of pollution. That's the pollution impact—just to compare it—of 20,000 daily flights across the world for 25 years. It's the biggest oil and gas project in a decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It just doesn't make any sense. The planet's cooking. We need to stop any new coal and gas projects now. So what does this government do? It clears the way for Woodside to proceed with its biggest project in 10 years. What about Browse, another component of Woodside's Burrup Hub gas expansion? This expansion is the most polluting of all coal, gas or oil proposals in the Southern Hemisphere. It will have a lifetime of emissions of more than 13 times Australia's annual emissions. Labor is acting as the political arm of the fossil fuel industry. They've got massive amounts of taxpayer dollars for fossil fuel products, over $10 billion in subsidies and $1.5 billion in the budget for Middle Arm, which will be a gas export hub.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is public money, our taxpayer money, literally being handed to these highly profitable gas companies that pay almost no tax. Unbelievable! Not only is the government letting Santos and Woodside virtually write their environmental policies, but it's also giving them cash handouts—money that could be used to put dental cover into Medicare, to build public housing or to ease the cost of living. But what do we get instead? We get huge gas projects that wreck our environment. With 2.5 or three degrees of warming we will have heatwaves that will kill thousands in our cities, floods and droughts that will cause massive crop failures, and cyclones and storms that will destroy entire communities. That's the future—that's what the scientists are saying the future is. That's the future for their own children and grandchildren that every Labor MP here is actually voting for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't need new gas expansion. Gas is not a transition fuel. It's a fossil fuel. Australia has enough gas for our domestic supply for the next 100 years. Australia barely uses any of the gas we extract, and we export 84 per cent of it. By the way, it's not households who use most of our domestic supply; it's actually the gas industry. You can't export natural gas in its raw form. It has to be turned into liquefied natural gas, LNG, a process that uses more gas than the entire manufacturing industry and double the amount that households use annually.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely, if we export all of this gas, Australians must be getting a good deal in tax revenue, right? Well, no. The industry pays almost no tax or royalties. Santos made $31 billion and paid no income tax; Chevron made $6.8 billion last year and paid $30 in income tax. Yes—$30! Woodside made $57 billion profit, with only three per cent tax paid. Even Texas, the crude oil and gas capital of the USA, has a royalty rate of 25 per cent on fossil fuels. Queensland's rate doesn't even hit 10 per cent. Gas companies like Woodside get our free money, pay nothing in return and leave us with a climate bomb in the form of the Beetaloo basin project. It's a pretty poor return on Australian investment. And, at the end of the day, it's the workers of these gas companies that are being left behind by this bill, while their employers laugh all the way to the bank, paying almost no tax on their billions in profit and wrecking the planet in the process.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  I rise to speak on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024. The thing that I'd say about the Australian Labor Party is that what we want to see is action on climate change. We want to take workers on the journey and we want to keep the lights on as well. I think that it's interesting that we've got the Greens on one side, who literally want to turn the lights off today, and then we've got the coalition on the other side, denying that climate change is happening. The truth is that it's the Australian Labor Party that will be in the best position to take us on this journey to net zero emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that it's important to understand our relationship with the resource sector. I'm a proud Western Australian, born and bred in the Goldfields. I have resources in my blood; I'm an engineer who has worked on the mines. But I am also someone who wants to see action on climate change. In WA, coal was first discovered in the Collie basin back in 1883. A few years later, the Collie coalmining district was declared, a railway was extended to Collie before the turn of the century and the production of coal began. Back then, in the 1800s, it was a pretty tough life for miners, but it was an important industry that saw the development of Western Australia. It was also an important development for the railway network and the regions in WA. By 1930, that industry had flourished and employed over 800 workers. By the 1950s, this had risen to 1,400 miners in the Collie basin. It remained a significant industry in the 2000s and employed 1,200 people on the mines and a thousand people in power stations and support industries. For decades, Collie has supported WA families, workers and industries. They've literally kept the lights on for households, industry and businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we decarbonise, the nature of our regions will change. I recognise our regions are the powerhouse of our country. That's where we get our food. That's where we get our minerals. That's where we get our energy resources. As we decarbonise, I want to make sure that we take these communities on board, because they have done so much for us in the past, and we absolutely want them to continue to play an important role in our country. The thing that's great about Collie is that it is now an example of the economic and energy transformation that is underway in our nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some years ago, a just transition working group was formed, and it was a partnership between private business, unions, workers and communities. They started thinking about plans for the future and how they wanted their town to be. So, when the Western Australian government announced their plan for an energy transition—which is about turning off coal-fired power stations by 2030—the community knew that they had a positive future and positive industries to ensure that their town continued to thrive. Collie is a beautiful place with beautiful old-growth forest trees. They have a lovely dam, and they've got some great bike trails as well. It's a really beautiful place to go visit. The interesting thing will be to see the industries that will develop in this town. The WA government committed $0.5 billion to a transition package, which included a fund to attract new industries. Among the new industries that have been discussed are a pilot plan for graphite and pumped hydro—a new alternative energy source—and they're also investing in skills. We don't want to see this in just one coal powered town in WA; we need to make sure that we see this across the nation. That's exact what this Net Zero Economy Authority bill does. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's think about it. This is about a transformation journey to net zero. But let's face it—it's not a journey; it's a race. It's a race that this government is committed to winning. We know that there is work that we must do to get there, and it's not a journey that we've embarked on lightly. It's something that we've taken very seriously, unlike the previous government. The previous government did not prepare to act and did not have a plan. They ignored the race and they ignored what was happening around them. They avoided the challenge that was before them. A coherent energy policy—did that exist? No. A climate change policy—did that exist? No. Actually, I think that there were 20 policies in total. Was there a strategic approach to the energy transition? No. There was no plan, no foresight and no long-term strategy about how to ensure the replacement of 24 coal fired plants such as Collie. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming into office, the Albanese government has turned this around. In our budget, we announced further initiatives to keep us on the path to net zero, and that pathway runs through Western Australia. The decisions that we make now will make a huge difference for our future. Australia has the potential to be a renewable energy power. We are going to do this by investing in programs to make sure that we get there, with $3.2 billion through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. This will help the commercialisation of clean tech over 10 years. It also includes $1.7 billion for the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. We should be a country that makes things here. This will support tech-linked priority sectors including green metals, batteries and low-carbon liquids. We also have $6.7 billion in hydrogen production tax credits from 2027 to 2050. Hydrogen is a little molecule with big ambition, and it is something that's going to help transform our energy use across Australia, with the $1.3 billion Hydrogen Headstart program to support early movers. There is also $7 billion for critical mineral production tax incentives for 31 critical minerals processed and refined up until 2040. There is also $1.5 billion to strengthen battery and solar supply chains. We saw during the pandemic that supply chains became very vulnerable. We need to make sure that we have robust supply chains so that we can make these projects shovel-ready.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have $0.5 billion for Geoscience to map Australia's critical minerals and groundwater systems. There is also $15 million for foundational activities for green metal development, which is something that I'm really excited about. If we can create green steel, this is going to transform the way that the world does its construction. Then there is $27 million to integrate household solar and batteries into the grid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our budget is one that invests in our clean future and a Future Made in Australia. We're creating new, secure and well-paid jobs in our regions like Collie but also in suburbs like the ones in my electorate—High Wycombe, Belmont, Redcliffe, Forrestfield. We're making sure that we're building infrastructure and clean energy to power new growth and a new generation of advanced manufacturing. We need to make more things here, and we're introducing legislation to do just that. Australian made means Australian jobs. These decisions are examples of a government leading from the front and preparing our country for a renewable energy future, examples of a government that places the future of Australians at the forefront of our policy, to ensure that our future is made in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill to establish the Net Zero Economy Authority supports Australian industries, workers and families to join the pathway to net zero. The new statutory agency will play an important role in driving our strategy. It will provide a centre for coordination and planning. It will foster and promote investment from the private and public sectors. It's very important to me and very important to Western Australia, and it will support workers affected by the transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am the daughter of a miner. I grew up in a nickel-mining town. My dad worked for a mining company for 19 years after he moved to Australia. When commodity prices hit rock bottom, I saw mass redundancies in my town. My dad, who had become the breadwinner at the age of 15, was basically told that he was redundant—'You're no longer needed.' He would have been in his mid-50s and probably at the end of his working career, because he had already worked for four decades as a metalworker. In this place, it's really important that we remember to think about the workers and put workers at the heart of our economy when we're looking at transitions. We need to make sure that we look after workers and take them on this journey as we see our economy transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This authority will collaborate with employers, unions and stakeholders to help retain people and find new opportunities. It will be able to do this through our establishing a legislative framework for an energy industry jobs plan. We'll look at redeployment and new opportunities that are key to the transition. Skills and experience are valuable, and we know that. I would say that my dad, when he didn't have employment, felt the opposite. He felt not valuable and not worthy. I want to make sure that we take people along on the journey. So making sure that we connect workers to interested employers will be a role for this authority, helping workers to find meaningful employment through the transition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that families are safe, secure and connected to their communities. This is important to everyone and a part of the Australian way of life. That's why Labor is putting these measures into place, so that all Australians can continue to enjoy and appreciate our lucky country. We will help businesses overcome the challenges of closures and help regional economies move smoothly through the process. A resilient and robust local workforce and economy will be the way to do this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority will play an important part in facilitating a holistic approach to the transition—one that would not have been possible under the previous government. We are a government with perspective. We are a government who care. We are a government for all Australians, not just a few. The authority will support the inclusion and participation of our First Nations communities in the transition. Education and promotional initiatives will be a part of the role of the authority, to ensure that communities remain informed of the facts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just me or Labor that supports the establishment of this authority; there is widespread community support. The government engaged a variety of stakeholders, including First Nations groups, education and training providers, industry, investors, regional bodies, communities, state and local governments and, of course, the mighty union movement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority will be governed by an independent board of a chair and up to eight members appointed by the responsible minister. We will ensure the board is responsible, representative and accountable. The board composition will include two members with experience from the union movement and two members that have experience in business, industry and finance or investment. Other members must have experience in either industrial relations, labour markets, economics, decarbonisation, technologies or policies, climate change, energy markets and regional development, First Nations engagement, advocacy, community leadership, public or corporate governance. We listened to the experts, and we want to make sure we get this decision right for our future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, we know that workers in communities have always played a significant role in the energy industry, right back to the 1890s—the Collie I talked about earlier versus the Collie of the 2030s. For this government, it will continue to see these communities play an important role—and that is our No. 1 priority as we travel on the pathway to net zero. While we're travelling on this journey together, it's not in isolation; it's a race. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BATES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  I rise to speak to the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024. The climate crisis is negatively impacting all aspects of modern life. The Australian population has gone through endless pain: sweltering summers, flooding events, incredible humidity, heatwaves and fires. And we know this is only going to get worse as the planet gets warmer and weather patterns become more and more unpredictable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in a climate crisis right now. We cannot afford any new coal and gas projects, but fossil fuel companies have an outrageous amount of power within our political system and will do all they can to keep their profits high at the expense of this planet. The climate crisis is not just an environmental issue, however; we know the impacts disproportionately affect marginalised communities. First Nations communities, lower socioeconomic areas and rural populations all bear most of the brunt of environmental degradation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are being taken for a ride. Massive coal and gas companies milk our resources and send the profits overseas while we at home face higher and higher home insurance prices, and more homes, including in my own electorate, that are entirely uninsurable. It's a broken system. A just transition must prioritise the needs and voices of those most affected by climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have long supported a transition to a zero emissions society—a transition that must be used to create a more economically just and equal society. That means making sure that renewable electricity is readily available and affordable for everyone, that buildings and homes are sustainable and climate change ready and that more people are employed in the green economy. We must be ready for this future, or Australia will be left behind yet again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Gas is often touted as a cleaner alternative to oil or coal. The reality is that the extraction, transportation and combustion of gas releases significant amounts of emissions into the atmosphere. This Labor government likes to trumpet on about the climate wars being over, but so long as it keeps approving new coal and gas mines the climate wars will continue. This government is giving gas companies a licence to destroy. As we all learned recently, the resources minister gets a letter from gas executives saying they want more money and less engagement with First Nations communities, and the next thing we know we have legislation that does exactly that—makes it easier to rapidly approve gas expansion. It is just what these huge fossil fuel companies needed—yet another win. When the fossil fuel industry says, 'Jump', Labor and the coalition say, 'How high?' Could it be that the donations from the gas companies to Labor and the coalition hold power over the decision-making process? Maybe. Probably. Definitely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor must stop opening new coal and gas mines and instead focus on meaningful investment to transition to renewable energy and a net zero economy. Approving new fossil fuel projects is, at this point, anti science and leaves younger Australians in particular to deal with the fallout of a problem that they did not create but will bear the brunt of. The government keeps repeating the talking point of the gas industry, that gas is the transition fuel to lower emissions, but every new gas well that is drilled and every new pipeline that is laid locks in decades of carbon emissions, further exacerbating climate change. Instead of investing in short-sighted solutions that perpetuate our dependence on fossil fuels, Australia must prioritise a rapid transition to renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the coalition's harebrained nonstarter that is their push for nuclear. If the eye-watering exorbitant costs aren't enough for you, the lengthy lead times required to establish a nuclear industry would leave us with a multidecade black hole in energy sufficiency and simply push back action on climate change. They're trying their best to delay climate action under a thinly veiled and incomplete policy that doesn't come close to stacking up. We don't have time for it. We just need to accept that climate change is real and start dealing with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia possesses abundant renewable energy resources: wind, solar and geothermal. With sensible investment in infrastructure and technology, our country could actually become a global leader in clean energy production, helping us at home and our neighbours in the Pacific and around the world. We're talking about benefits beyond just mitigating the effects of climate change. There are vast economic benefits as well—job creation and energy independence, just to name a couple. By harnessing the power of the sun, wind and waves, Australia can secure a brighter and more sustainable future for us and for generations to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, we have had some Labor backbenchers come out with concerns about their party's own Future Gas Strategy. Any Labor MPs who care about climate change must vote with the Greens against more coal and gas for a safer future. It's all well and good to express your concerns on social media, but at the end of the day, if you're voting for policies that enable fossil fuel expansion, what is the point? We are in the middle of a climate emergency, and all we are getting is some tinkering around the edges that poses precisely zero threat to the fossil fuel industry when what we need to be doing is stopping all new fossil fuel projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for urgent climate action in Australia could not be clearer. This Labor government's intention to expand the coal and gas industry is not only environmentally disastrous but economically short-sighted and socially short-sighted. Instead of doubling down on fossil fuels, it is absolutely critical that Australia rapidly transition to renewable energy. We need to be leading the way. We need to be promoting environmental justice towards a more sustainable future for all of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is one of the world's largest per capita emitters of greenhouse gases. We export over one billion tonnes of emissions a year and produce another half a billion here at home. As a developed nation, we have a moral obligation to take bold action on climate change. This government must reject any expansion of the fossil fuel industry, and it must rapidly and equitably transition to renewable energy. Australia should be demonstrating leadership on the global stage, inspiring other nations to follow suit, but yet again, as always, we are playing catch up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The climate crisis could not be more urgent. We must walk the walk and inspire international cooperation. We simply cannot afford to be left behind. Instead, this Labor government is joining with the coalition in making gas the poster child of the future. The fossil fuel industry is a Ponzi scheme, and this house of cards is already crashing down all around us. A rebranding of Scott Morrison's gas-fired recovery is not a prosperous future. My constituents in Brisbane want a clean, renewable future for this country, because it is what we all deserve.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:14</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. This legislation is historic. It is historic because it marks an opportunity for Australia in the face of the existential crisis that is climate change. It is historic because, if we seize this moment, if we take this opportunity, Australia can become a renewable energy superpower, one that not only produces clean energy for our communities and for export but creates new industries and jobs for all. It's historic because workers and their unions, community groups and climate organisations have been fighting for this for decades—because everyday working people should not be left behind or disadvantaged while we recharge our economy with renewable energy. Rather, they should profit and benefit from that change. More than anything, these bills are historic because they represent our future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes without saying that the current moment represents a critical juncture for the world. In Australia, the effects of climate change are already being felt—scorching heat across our summers, tropical diseases heading south and longer bushfire seasons. From north to south, east to west, we're seeing extreme weather events just about every week—floods, fire, cyclones and drought. While our own shorelines are being flooded with higher and higher king tides, we know that the changing climate is also impacting our region. With sea levels rising in the Pacific, island homes could be washed away in the decades to come. We cannot afford to delay proper action any longer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Cooper, this is something that is of the highest priority for me. My constituents care about strong action on climate change, and I'm committed to representing them. I'm committed to representing them within the Albanese Labor government, a party of government, a party that is actually about getting things done. I don't waste the precious time I have in this place going about throwing personal insists and jibes at individuals who are doing their jobs. I don't waste the parliament's time pulling stunts or moving motions without doing any of the complex work and hard slog that needs to go into seriously changing the laws of this country. I take the time and make the effort to help bring about real change, and that is what these bills deliver. They have been painstakingly written, with all the consultation, the legal advice and the touch of genius that goes into such things. I commend the minister and his team for the long hard hours that have gone into drafting these bills. This is the real change that I've been fighting for my whole career in the labour movement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Labor Party is the party of workers. It is proudly the party of the union movement. In some corners of society, there is a misleading notion that the labour movement is at odds with the environmentalist movement. This is a misconception being peddled—that stronger environmental protection or action to address climate change will inherently impact the opportunities of everyday working people. That's a lie. I was a union representative as a young nurse back in 1985. My first official role with the Australian nursing federation began in 1997. I eventually became the federal secretary of that union before having the honour of representing all Australian workers for eight years as president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Throughout all that time, there was a growing awareness of changing climate. As the scientific base of evidence continued to grow, all areas of society resolved that something needed to change. Change was needed to reduce our emissions and protect our environment and, importantly, we needed to protect and support workers through that change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be remiss not to acknowledge the immense difficulties for government and industry in taking effective action to address climate change. It's no easy feat. We know in the past governments have let working people down when making serious changes to our economy. I think back to the 1970s and 1980s, when the world's economy underwent a series of structural changes. As Australia got swept up in these reforms, many workers got left behind. For example, in the 1970s, the reduction of tariffs on textiles, clothing and footwear resulted in fierce competition from cheaper imports from countries in the Global South. This saw a rapid decline in Australian manufacturing of these items and significant job losses. Looking back on this history, some might say that these sorts of structural adjustments were important for the Australian economy. But what history too often forgets is the very real economic and social costs for workers, families and communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what happened to all of the workers who lost those jobs? The reality of history paints a bleak picture: a third were able to find commensurate employment, another third found insecure work at lower wages and with poorer conditions than they previously enjoyed, and a final third never worked again. These were skilled, hardworking people with families to look after, mortgages to pay, kids to care for and grandparents to provide for. A more recent example is the case for ex-Mitsubishi workers when the South Australian plant closed in 2008 and again in 2017, when the then coalition government drove the car manufacturing industry entirely from our shores. An almost identical fate fell upon those workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the car manufacturing and textile industries tell us cautionary tales, there are road maps of how change can be well managed to support workers through industry transition. Germany is a shining example. In Germany, the government chose to work with unions, workers and the industry when the decision was made to downscale their coalmining industry. Importantly, German workers were effectively redeployed across the industry in a systematic approach to avoid the sudden negative impact of single mine closures on the surrounding communities. This process saw thousands of workers successfully reskilled and re-employed, with only a few having to take funded early retirement. There is a simple story to tell here: working together and planning properly can mean no-one gets left behind. Here the Albanese Labor government has learnt well and will not be making the mistakes of governments past. This Labor government is taking strong action to protect our environment, address climate change, transition our economy and, all the while, support working people, working together so no-one gets left behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will establish a new independent statutory authority to promote orderly and positive economic transformation as the world decarbonises. The bill sets out the detailed functions, powers and governance arrangements for the authority and establishes a framework for the use of pooled redeployment arrangements when coal- or gas-fired power stations close. As a fossil fuel based economy, the economic, employment and regional implications for Australia of the world decarbonising could be significant if it's not well managed. Australia is in a unique and privileged position. With our abundance of renewable energy sources, we're home to every metal and critical mineral essential to get to net zero technologies. This is especially true for our regions. They are the key to our future net zero economy. Our opportunity is here, and we must seize it—and, my word, we are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority will be a partner on behalf of the Labor government, working with industry and investors in getting big transformational projects happening. Most importantly, as is always front of mind for this former president of the ACTU, this bill will support workers in emissions-intensive industries to access new employment and acquire new skills to improve their employment prospects. This bill has our workers and our regions at its core. As we transition, the authority will work with employers, unions and others to support workers into new opportunities. We know there are big changes to come in our economy and change can be daunting, but the authority will be there side by side with our workers, our regions and our communities. Importantly, the authority will work with First Nations people so they can participate in and benefit from the economic shift to net zero emissions, working together so no-one gets left behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own community of Cooper, in Melbourne's north, climate change is one of the most important issues. I have many groups of climate activists, like Darebin Climate Action Now and the ACF Darebin group, who are staunch advocates and activists. They volunteer their time to raise awareness about the climate crisis and advocate for governments of all levels to take bold action. They live their values and are incredibly environmentally conscious. They shop local. They ride bikes. They use public transport. They buy clothes second-hand. They are the definition of reduce, reuse and recycle. But, beyond that, they are playing an important role in helping me develop policy and helping this Labor government develop a broader climate policy for the future. They understand and support Labor's plan to reach 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030 and our significant investment in green technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's already been a 25 per cent increase in renewables in the national electricity market since we came to office. A few weeks ago, we saw a big boost to renewables in Victoria and Tasmania: a combined 1.7-gigawatt piece of the six-gigawatt pie in Australia's largest ever tender for renewable energy. Of that, 1.4 gigawatts is for my wonderful home state of Victoria, which is enough renewable energy for 700,000 homes. This will give confidence to investors to build renewable-energy-generating projects sooner rather than later. Also, a fortnight ago the budget delivered a massive investment in renewable energy. We've allocated $22.7 billion to grow clean industries like critical minerals, renewable hydrogen and clean energy manufacturing. This is a once-in-a-generation investment from the Albanese Labor government that is going to make such a big impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate groups have come out in support of this announcement. The Climate Council called this a 'decisive turn towards Australia's clean energy future', with the federal government 'charting a course to power past the end of fossil fuels'. The Smart Energy Council CEO said, 'This budget changes Australia's future,' and, 'This charts the pathway to Australia's prosperity and comparative advantage.' And do you know who else has come out in support of our Future Made in Australia plan? The Australian Council of Trade Unions. They say that it's 'set to create secure manufacturing jobs and develop new industries as part of the government's objectives of turning Australia into a clean energy superpower'. The Labor Party, the union movement, the climate movement and industry are all in lockstep. Climate action and action to support working people, jobs and the environment are working together so no-one gets left behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that we need to continue to move towards low-emission technology with renewables and not prolong the life of fossil fuels. Renewables are the future of Australia. There's simply no other option. The transition to renewables must be rapid, but it must be just. The transition to renewables must be equitable. We can't leave anyone behind, not a single worker or their family nor a single region or community. I owe it to the people of Cooper, to our workers, to those I have fought alongside and to all those I will continue to fight for to stand here today in fierce support of this bill. It is a bill I've fought for for a very long time, a bill that will change the story for a future powered by renewable energy, a bill shaped by the voices of workers, a bill that will bring us together to build a new economy with decent jobs and a clean future, a bill where no-one is left behind and a bill that shows we are about real change.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:28</span>):  It's only been a few days since the world's leading IPCC scientists said that we are now expecting the world's temperature to rise by at least 2.5 degrees and announced their despair at the lack of progress being made by world leaders. On the same day that those dire predictions of an over-2½-degree world were being reported, there was irony in the government announcing its gas strategy to accelerate new fossil fuel projects in this country and lock in gas and fossil fuels till well beyond 2050. The International Energy Agency, scientists, my constituents in Warringah, many people around Australia and, quite frankly, anyone with common sense know that, if the aim is to reach net zero and limit warming to 1.5 degrees, we must not have any new coal or gas projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is in that context that today I consider this bill for the Net Zero Economy Authority. It's a big title, and it's an ambitious task for an agency, but I have to point out that there is a catch, and I would ask that no-one be misguided in the breadth of what is intended to be caught by this legislation. I'm hearing many in this place talk of it being revolutionary and of no-one being left behind, but the reality is that many people are being left behind. This is a very cherry-picked approach to who will be assisted in this transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill aims to coordinate Australia's orderly transition to net zero and introduce a long-overdue support framework to transition coal- and gas-fired power station workers. I repeat: it will assist to transition only coal- and gas-fired power station workers—no other workers in other industries, only those relating to coal- and gas-fired power stations. It's very niche, as Australia transitions away from fossil fuel generated energy. It's very limited as to which workers it is designed to assist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the bill's objectives, to support workers in emissions-intensive industries to access new employment, is not supported by the bill's operational provisions. The authority will establish the Energy Industry Jobs Plan, which will support employees impacted by the closure of some coal-fired and gas-fired power stations through pooled redeployment plans. But this support is narrow. It not only excludes many trade-exposed industries but also permanently locks them out in the way it has been drafted. The frustration is that we have been engaging with the minister and the government in trying to have amendments that would properly reflect the intention of many of the speeches in this place from government, but they are refusing to amend the legislation to actually give it this genuine purpose. At the moment, it focuses only on coal- and gas-fired power station workers and their directly associated coalmines, and it ignores every other coalmine, LNG plant and other trade-exposed industries. You have to wonder why. Is it because the government on one hand wants to beat its chest that it's moving on its transition to net zero economy but on the other doesn't actually want to admit to specific communities that are reliant on fossil fuel industries that their industries and jobs are going to go? Rather than having an honest conversation with all communities, we have this cherry-picked approach to transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is unacceptable to create grand objectives to transition Australia's economy to a net zero economy—something that will take time, with evolving needs, particularly when it comes to just transition, though I strongly support the intent—but then fail to provide the authority with the teeth and the scope to actually achieve that objective. The government's position is to focus on industries that have defined closure timelines, as is the case for coal-fired power stations. The government is completely ignoring the fact that other industries are also facing closure as we transition to net zero economy. It's political doublespeak, not wanting to acknowledge that some communities are going to need to transition. It's this idea that we are going to have gas exports forever, that there will be thermal coal exports forever—there won't be. They have to go, and it is a duty of government to ensure those communities and workers are not left behind and that they are assisted in their transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The broader issue, which is I think really disappointing from the government in relation to this bill, is the government's failure to acknowledge and properly manage Australia's inevitable decline in coal and gas and other emission-exposed industries of export. That decline is inevitable. Look no further than Australia's largest mining companies. BHP has divested from its coal assets, and even Glencore, Australia's largest coalminer, is committed to a responsible phasing down of our thermal coal production and has already closed mines in Australia. This bill must align its transition rhetoric with adequate provision to include all coalmining communities. It is selling them a lie to tell them that their jobs will be there forever in an export sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to have an expansion of the mechanism in this bill to ensure that all workers are genuinely assisted. At the moment, there is no mechanism to expand trade-exposed employers within this bill. I want to be very clear for all members of government: there is no mechanism within the bill as currently drafted to expand that scope. That means that neither the authority nor even the minister can expand support—as intended by this bill—for other industries or workers that we know are impacted by the transition to net zero and that will need support. It just doesn't make sense why there is a refusal by the government to amend this and to acknowledge this failing of the legislation as it currently stands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I guess it's a political thing. I don't know if it's because they don't want to acknowledge that those transitions are going to happen for those communities, but it makes it very disappointing when it comes to the scope of this legislation. I know the government does not want to acknowledge to certain communities that, ultimately, the export of coal will go—that those jobs will be lost. I know that it's difficult, politically. But an honest conversation is needed, not only for the just transition for individuals and communities but for the sensible economic transition of our economy, with the many renewable job opportunities that we need filled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just give some numbers: approximately 10,000 jobs are covered by the Energy Industry Jobs Plan under this bill compared to those which aren't but which should be and could be with the amendments that I and many others are proposing. That's 112,000 jobs from export coalmines, oil and gas which are not. And an additional 90,000 geographically dispersed industries, such as mechanics and gasfitters, are also excluded from assistance under this legislation. Just so we are very clear: less than 10 per cent of the jobs that should be covered are in fact covered by the scope of this legislation, and there's no mechanism to increase that number.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we must transition to net zero. Transition is not about closures and job losses but about vast opportunities as we transform our economy. In Warringah, people are ready for Australia to ride that clean energy wave with policies—and I support the government on its Future Made in Australia policy and commitment. Warringah businesses are embracing the transition to renewables and enjoying the financial benefits. But we need a workforce to meet the demand and opportunity that these policies will bring. The Business Council of Australia predicts that there will be some 395,000 clean export jobs created in Australia, and this authority can work with communities and workers to help them seize those opportunities. We know it works; when regions, communities and workers are consulted to co-design solutions, they are successful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have success stories already. The Latrobe Valley Authority and the economic growth zone created 2,500 new jobs and contributed to the generation of more than $99 million in private investment. In Germany's Ruhr region, the transition from a coal centred economy was successfully managed through significant investments in infrastructure, education and economic diversification. These created new opportunities in manufacturing, technology and services. The Canadian government is also actively phasing out coal-fired power, supporting affected workers and communities. They're focusing on community engagement and economic diversification. And it's not just coalmining or fossil fuel power stations that should be included in the scope; it should be extended to include workers around the country—including car mechanics—whose industries will transition. The opportunity is huge for the Net Zero Economy Authority to link its strategic goals with a just transition of workers impacted by any industry facing closure or transition. It will be key to coordinate between the public and the private sectors, communities and First Nations people to ensure that the transition is effective and efficient and maximises the co-benefits for the regions that are impacted. This is what we are seeing here: a cherry-pick of one small 10 per cent of industry that really deserves the assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's prudent for the Net Zero Economy Authority to engage widely and determine the best policy levers that will unlock private capital to bring trillions of dollars of investment into the Australian economy. It can enable value-adding to Australia's vast critical minerals industry; production of green iron and steel; and manufacturing of solar goods and specialised batteries. And it can ensure that we are competitive internationally. It will improve a range of measures. Within its limited scope, I know that it will be effective, from production tax credits to contracts for different local content requirements and government procurement. Those must be balanced to provide the necessary market support to be effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The US has seen a huge surge of investment because of a very attractive legislative environment, leading to trillions of dollars in private investment. We know that China has built its renewables manufacturing sector on government subsidies, giving EV maker BYD alone a US$4 billion start-up subsidy. The EU has dedicated 578 billion euros of its 2021-2027 budget to climate-related spending, facilitating a clean transition. And Japan, Korea and Canada have also made substantial commitments to their transitions. If we get it right, a $100 billion investment over 10 years could deliver $300 billion in renewable exports and keep Australia competitive and playing to our strengths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Warringah and the Northern Beaches are becoming a hub for businesses in the renewable space that will benefit from the Future Made in Australia strategy. There is vision and there is appetite for a clean and profitable future. The bills provide a good framework to support those existing businesses and future startups. So, whilst the Net Zero Economy Authority will play an important role in Australia's history, as detailed in legislation I've brought to this place in the past, like the climate change bill, we must support a smooth and sensible transition to a carbon-neutral economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With amendments, I am confident that an independent net zero economy authority will enable us to make the most of our natural advantages while creating opportunities and well-paid smart jobs. However, it is ironic, as I said at the beginning, that the first bills before the parliament following the government announcing its Future Gas Strategy are these ones. One of the many functions of the proposed net zero authority is to promote coordination and consistency in the design and implementation of Australian government policies, programs and plans. There's an irony in that. It's not an easy task. On one hand, we're transitioning our economy away from polluting coal and gas and creating a renewable future made in Australia economy. It's hard to reconcile that with the government's support of new fossil fuel projects and ongoing approvals by the environment minister to coal and gas projects well beyond 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ensuring we maximise the opportunities of net zero requires coordination and consistency in the government's policies. You can't have it both ways. It requires engagement across the economy with the private and public sector, communities, First Nations groups and unions. The Net Zero Economy Authority will ensure that Australia's transition is orderly for some workers. But, if we are going to meet our emissions reduction targets and actually what we need to keep our communities safe and healthy, then we have to go beyond this little narrow bit. The current bills, I would say, finally, are heavy on aspiration and broad objects but light on detail and specifics. They desperately need amending to genuinely fulfil the purpose they are intended for.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  The Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 seek to establish an independent authority tasked with overseeing the transition to a net zero economy. This means Australia needs to work towards achieving a balance between the greenhouse gases we emit and those we remove or offset. The urgency of the climate crisis demands bold and decisive action, and the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill represents a crucial step forward in our effort to combat climate change and secure a prosperous, resilient future for generations to come. This action aims to stop the ongoing progression of global warming and mitigate its devastating effects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is establishing a new net zero economy authority because we want to ensure Australia and regions like the Illawarra prosper in the future net zero global economy. The shift to net zero is already happening. Australia, along with the rest of the world, is reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by the middle of the century. The establishment of such an authority is not merely symbolic; it is a logical recognition of the scale and complexity of the task at hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is not a problem that can be solved by individual action alone. It requires coordinated, systemic change across all sectors of society, from government and industry to communities and individuals. The Net Zero Economy Authority will play a pivotal role in driving this transformation. It will have the mandate and the power to advise, regulate and coordinate efforts across sectors, ensuring that we stay on track to meet our net zero targets and fulfil our international commitments under the Paris Agreement. The authority would promote logical and positive economic transformation by helping to facilitate the achievement of Australia's greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Assisting Australia's transformation as a renewable energy superpower and ensuring Australia's regions and our workers are supported through and benefit from the associated economic transformation will be the key priorities. The transition to net zero emissions will mark one of the most profound economic changes since the Industrial Revolution. The substantial and widespread efforts worldwide to decrease emissions will reshape our industries and our economies fundamentally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new authority, with its focus on managing economic change, complements over $40 billion in government initiatives to reduce emissions and become a renewable energy superpower. These include the $20 billion Rewiring the Nation program to modernise our electricity grid and infrastructure so it can support a renewable-energy based energy system, the $1.9 billion Powering the Regions fund to support the decarbonisation of existing industries and the creation of new clean-energy industries, the $6 billion critical minerals facility to grow our critical minerals production sector, the $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program to support development of large-scale renewable hydrogen projects and the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund to diversify and transform Australia's industry for a net zero economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our steelworks in the Illawarra, BlueScope, which is located in the suburb of Port Kembla, is a significant industrial site for the region, contributing millions to the local economy and generations of employment. Having operated for decades, it plays a vital role in steel production, supplying materials for various industries and infrastructure projects. Our renewable energy transformation will require five billion tonnes of steel between now and 2050, and our steelworks will be an integral part of achieving this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the Illawarra has heavy industry ingrained in its core, it is also uniquely positioned to become a renewable energy superpower to help achieve a net zero economy. The Illawarra region has attracted significant attention as a thriving centre for pioneering renewable energy solutions, and spearheading this are companies like Hysata, which I have spoken about in this parliament before. They are world renowned for the production of the world's most efficient hydrogen electrolysers, having won an award at COP28 and having just achieved the Southern Hemisphere's largest ever series B capital raise of $172 million. These electrolysers will play a crucial role in the decarbonisation of heavy industry and large-scale hydrogen production. We also have Sicona Battery Technologies, who have made significant strides in the development of next-generation lithium-ion batteries. Their cutting-edge technology promises enhanced performance and durability, crucial for storing renewable energy and powering electric vehicles. We have Green Gravity, who have ingeniously repurposed retired mine shafts to generate kinetic energy. The innovative approach not only provides a sustainable source of power but also repurposes existing infrastructure, demonstrating our region's commitment to both environmental stewardship and economic revitalisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Authority will ensure we're looking after Australia's workers and our regions as we transform from a fossil fuel based economy to a renewable energy superpower. This recognises that the way we navigate economic change is just as important as reaching the destination of the net zero economy. The authority will be a partner, on behalf of the government, with industry and investors in getting big transformational projects happening—projects that decarbonise industrial facilities, build new industries and grow the future economic base for regions like the Illawarra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years, the Illawarra region has emerged as a dynamic hub for groundbreaking advancements in renewable energy technology, marking a profound shift towards sustainability and resilience. With lush landscapes and vibrant communities, the Illawarra is transforming into a hive where innovation thrives, paving a clearer way towards a cleaner and greener future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Green hydrogen is expected to supply 10 to 15 per cent of energy in a net zero global economy and contribute 20 per cent of the total abatement required by 2050 for net zero. I'll go back to a company, Hysata. Hysata's innovative electrolysers will bring down the cost of green hydrogen and reduce energy usage, as they operate at 95 per cent efficiency, compared with around 65 per cent efficiency for other modern electrolysers. This is huge for industry, but it's also huge for the Illawarra. It really puts us on the map.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Projects like this are part of securing Australia's place as a renewable energy superpower and securing the well-paid secure jobs that come with exporting cleaner, cheaper, reliable renewable energy to the rest of the world. With the industry announcing that 24 coal-fired power stations will be shutting by 2030, under the watch of those opposite, the era of coal-fired power is drawing to a close. Those opposite had no plans for what would be replacing their electricity and no plans to help the huge workforce supporting these power stations as they transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister has said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key aspects of achieving net zero involves the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure as well as the upgrading of energy grids to accommodate those new sources of power. In late 2023, the Albanese Labor government, through the Australian Research Council, funded the establishment of a Training Centre in Energy Technologies for Future Grids at the University of Wollongong. Amongst other things, this centre will develop innovations that will facilitate the integration of renewable energy into the electricity grid and maintain grid stability. It is important that renewable energy provide a predictable and sustainable source of energy. The university's research in this area could prove vital to this process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A skilled workforce, like the one we are so fortunate to have in the Illawarra, is essential for the construction, installation, and maintenance of renewable energy systems, including engineers, technicians, electricians and project managers. Training programs and apprenticeships can help develop the necessary skills and ensure that workers are equipped to meet the demands of our growing sector. This is why I secured two crucial facilities for the Illawarra: the $10 million Energy Futures Skills Centre at the University of Wollongong and the $2.5 million renewable energy training centre at Wollongong TAFE. As Australia's fleet of power stations inevitably close, the Net Zero Economy Authority will work with employers, unions and others in our community to support workers into new opportunities. This is not just the right thing to do by workers; it also ensures we are making good use of the highly skilled workers we need more of in the net zero economy. The authority will help communities navigate this change, especially in regions where change will be significant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will be promoting innovation and investment in low-carbon technologies and infrastructure. From renewable energy and energy efficiency to sustainable transport and land-use practices, we must harness the power of innovation to drive the transition to a cleaner economy. It will engage stakeholders at all levels of society, from business leaders and policymakers to community organisations and grassroots activists. Climate action is a collective endeavour, and the Net Zero Economy Authority will work to build partnerships, foster dialogue and mobilise support for climate solutions. This will ensure that no-one is left behind in the transformation to a net zero economy. We must prioritise equity and social justice, recognising that the burden of climate change falls disproportionately on the most vulnerable people among us. It will be guided by principles of fairness and inclusion, striving to create opportunities for all to thrive in a sustainable future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 represents a historic opportunity to chart a new course towards a brighter and more sustainable future. It is a testament to our shared commitment to leaving a legacy of hope and resilience for future generations.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300124" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TINK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  For some time now, my community in North Sydney has been calling for action to mitigate the impacts of climate change, while supporting economic opportunities in emerging green technologies and industries. We've spoken about it as gearing our nation towards a forward-facing economy, and I welcome this opportunity to speak about the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Transforming the Australian economy to net zero emissions is one of the biggest opportunities and challenges of our time. Indeed, former US senator and secretary of state John Kerry has likened the challenge to a wartime effort, highlighting the national security threat climate change poses and the type of mobilisation required to address it. Much of this transition will play out in regions outside our capital cities, where the bulk of Australia's industrial base is located. While I represent the urban electorate of North Sydney, my community elected me on a platform of ensuring that the transition to net zero is fair and equitable. I also have a deep personal connection to regional Australia, having grown up in north-west New South Wales, so I know exactly how pivotal one industry can be to an entire community and how important it is to ensure that, as industry transforms, communities are taken along for the ride. Ultimately, though, whether it's my electorate of North Sydney, or my hometown region of northern New South Wales, both communities are looking to capitalise on the strong economic growth that should come with this transition to a net zero carbon economy. Both communities see the potential that comes with our nation delivering on our climate targets and ensuring regional communities thrive. And both fundamentally recognise the importance of building communities that are climate-safe, regenerative, economically sustainable and socially just.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's regions, workers and communities stand to benefit from the global shift to green technologies and energies, but only if the transition is managed well and with the fair distribution of wealth generated from the transition across our whole economy. Transition authorities, such as the one proposed in this legislation, have proven to play a crucial role in helping countries like Germany, Canada, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States all manage the impacts of a changing energy sector. Given this, where there's a lesson for us to learn from those countries, I suggest that we learn it well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I broadly welcome the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 then, along with its proposal to establish the Net Zero Economy Authority for the purposes of coordinating Australia's transformation to a net zero emissions economy. However, for the authority to achieve its goal of helping Australia to meet its greenhouse gas reductions targets, and to support the transition to a net zero emissions economy, its establishment must be accompanied by strong and clear climate targets; policies that provide clear direction and empowerment; and appropriate settings from the government. Without the policies in place to reduce emissions, including phasing out fossil fuel extraction and use, and clear sector-by-sector plans to manage an equitable transition, this authority will not achieve its goals. Additionally, I believe the bill could be strengthened by taking a whole-of-community approach; expanding the scope of the authority beyond coal regions to other industries affected by climate change and the energy transition; ensuring an independent board appointment process, where members are appointed by an independent selection panel; ensuring long-term funding for the authority; and avoiding overlap with existing industrial relations frameworks. I note my crossbench colleagues, including the members for Mackellar and Indi, have proposed amendments to achieve many of these things, and I support their calls and commend their amendments both to the minister and the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The core objectives of the authority as established by this legislation are appropriate. Specifically, I welcome the focus on promoting investment in decarbonisation initiatives, especially within energy-centric regions—the facilitation of public and private sector participation and investment in greenhouse gas emissions, reduction and net zero transformation initiatives is good. At the same time, helping employees across closing coal- and gas-fired power stations, and their affiliated employers who are impacted by the net zero transformation, to transition to a new opportunity is also welcome. Harmonising and coordinating government-wide policies aimed at achieving net zero emissions and achieving Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets is also good, as is building community understanding, confidence and engagement with the net zero transformation, and supporting First Nations communities in gaining advantages from this transition. Finally, engaging with the broader public to enhance understanding and involvement in the transition process by encouraging, supporting, developing and delivering educational and promotional initiatives is sorely needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, as a nation, we are incredibly lucky when it comes to our clean energy endowment. Australia enjoys many comparative advantages in the transition to clean energy. We have a higher ratio of renewable energy resources to domestic demand than many other countries. We have vast access to mineral resources that will remain in demand, including some that are crucial to the energy transition, and we have the existing expertise to mine them. We also enjoy a proximity to growing Asian markets. With our massive landmass and unparalleled solar and wind resources, we are truly well placed to become a renewable superpower. But, to realise this opportunity, we need to step into it with purpose and in a coordinated fashion, ensuring no person, no community and no economic sector is left behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond Zero Emissions estimates that Australia can grow its revenue from new green exports to $333 billion by 2050, which is almost triple the value of the 2019 fossil fuel exports. This will only be achieved, however, if our approach to transitioning our industries is inclusive, participatory and consultative. A top-down planning model will not work, and we must recognise the unique needs and opportunities of each community. Ultimately this revolution must be led by regional communities, not foisted upon them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To effectively manage the changing landscape of Australian industry, ensuring and maintaining a strong social licence for renewable energy will be essential, and this authority can play a crucial role in ensuring that. There are, however, potential changes to the bill that would strengthen it. The first is to take a whole-of-community approach. Regional communities are often built around a core industry, and any impact to that industry has ripple effects through the entire community, to everything from the local school to the mechanic to the coffee shop. Supporting a smooth transition requires not only working with employers and employees from the impacted industries but should also extend to the broader community, to address the cumulative impacts of the change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Next Economy, who have worked extensively with regional communities to manage economic change, recommended in their submission to the Senate inquiry on this legislation a more holistic economic development approach to ensure long-term resilience and prosperity at the regional level. An example of what this may look like would be the authority offering structured support to small businesses in the region to take advantage of new opportunities, and investment in things like local health services, wellbeing, child care, aged care, housing, education and transport, to make communities more attractive to new people and new businesses. Ultimately what could be better for a region then becoming a hub for new, in-demand skills development? It would be incredible to see this new authority play a role in identifying that sort of opportunity for regional communities in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Next is expanding the scope of the authority beyond coal regions. While it makes sense for the authority to focus on regions facing coal-fired and gas-fired power station closures in the first instance, ultimately the scope of the authority should not be limited to these areas alone but rather extended to be broad enough to support all regions where core industries will be impacted by climate change. These industries will include things like forestry, tourism and agricultural industries, just to name a few. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need a more transparent board appointment process. As the board is the key decision-maker for the authority, it is imperative that the appointment of members to the board should be transparent and free from real or perceived undue political interference. More could be done to ensure members of the board bring appropriate knowledge and expertise to the work of the authority and that the work of the board is informed by a variety of perspectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As it stands, the board will consist of a chair and at least five, and not more than eight, other members. Two board members must have expertise or experience in the trade union movement, and two other board members must have expertise or experience in business, industry, finance or investment. A board position should also be reserved, though, for a First Nations person, and there should be at least one board member with experience in regional development. The government should also consider reserving a board position for someone with expertise and significant standing in climate science and engineering. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not appropriate that the minister is responsible for appointing all board members. I also think it is a significant weakness that the guidelines for appointment do not currently stipulate that the board must include someone with deep knowledge and connections across regional and rural Australia or someone with First Nations connections. For this reason, I strongly support the amendments of my crossbench colleagues the member for Indi and the member for Mackellar to ensure the appointment of board members is independent, transparent and appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need more secure long-term funding for this authority. To date, $83.2 million in funding over four years has been announced for the authority, but this is not enough to ensure it can engage in long-term planning. As the Grattan Institute has stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To take a true place-based approach that creates real change and strengthens regional economies, the Authority must be able to take a long-term view. It will not be able to design or commit to long-term activities if it does not have budget certainty beyond three-year funding envelopes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the authority is expected to provide real help to communities and regions at the forefront of the energy transition, it must be securely funded. Research by The Next Economy shows the work of transition authorities and outcomes from regional communities are more successful when the authority has access to its own funding. The Grattan Institute has also recommended legislating a minimum 10-year budget for the authority to put it on a stable footing and increase its effectiveness. To secure this funding, the government should redirect subsidies from the fossil fuel industries in consumption—which, according to last week's budget, will cost our economy upwards of $44 billion over the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Next, the authority should avoid overlap with existing industrial relations frameworks. While the bill is designed to operate within the existing industrial relations framework, multiple stakeholders representing businesses that are likely to be affected by this bill have raised concerns with the content and practical implementation of the Energy Industry Jobs Plan in part 5 of the bill. The obligations in the jobs plan have considerable overlap with existing obligations in Australia's industrial relations framework, and clarity is needed as to how these areas of overlap and the inconsistencies will be resolved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill mandates employers who are closing must offer support to their workers, including retraining, financial support and career guidance, redeployment options, and paid leave. It creates processes and schemes for pooled redundancy and redeployment to enhance worker security and mobility, and it implements a system whereby the Fair Work Commission can issue binding decisions on the specific types of support that employers are required to provide to their workers. Further clarification, however, should be provided on how these inconsistencies and areas of overlap between existing industrial relations frameworks and the Energy Industry Jobs Plan can be resolved to provide more certainty to affected employers and to avoid unintended consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I reiterate that the lofty goals of this legislation will not be achieved without stronger climate policy from this government. This agency—this single agency—simply will not succeed in its goal of transitioning workers and communities away from fossil fuels if the government continues to approve and fund new fossil fuel projects without laying out a clear pathway to net zero. The Australia Institute has found there are more than 100 new fossil fuel projects planned in Australia. If all of these projects proceed, they will produce $4.8 billion tonnes of emissions by 2030, and this government have given no confidence that they intend to curtail fossil fuel use or export. They have provided considerable funding to the Middle Arm gas project, they have passed the sea-dumping legislation following lobbying by Santos, they have declined to add a climate trigger to our central environmental legislation and, most recently, they have announced a gas strategy that posits gas as a central part of Australia's energy and export sectors out to 2050 and beyond. It is essential to provide certainty for communities, workers and investors. Talking up climate action while announcing gas plans out to 2050 and continuing to approve new fossil fuel projects does not provide it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is a good start to help guide Australia's net zero transition, but without a detailed plan, strong interim targets, and policy settings to help industries and communities a net zero authority will not alone achieve the goal of getting to net zero emissions by 2050.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  If ever there was a region both well positioned and, indeed, capable of tackling the real challenges of climate change, and taking full advantage of the opportunities that lay ahead, it is Newcastle and the Hunter region. I am literally on the coalface of this change. There's probably a bit of a different perspective in North Sydney, but we are full of confidence about where this government is taking this nation. Newcastle and the Hunter have literally powered this nation for generations. With the right policy settings and investments, our government is ensuring that we will continue to power Australia, albeit in new forms of energy, for many generations to come. The Albanese Labor government is absolutely committed to supporting regions like mine that are carbon-intensive economies to take full advantage of the economic and job opportunities that will come with more affordable and reliable renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Key to this orderly and positive transition is the Net Zero Economy Authority, which the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 is establishing. The net zero authority will ensure that workers, industries and communities are supported through this change and that we will be able to seize the opportunities of Australia's net zero transition. This is a huge job. I'm not sure that all members appreciate the scale at which this transition has to keep pace. This is turning around an entire economy. This government does not underestimate the task ahead. I mean it when I say that it is our generation's industrial revolution. We don't have time for Luddites. We don't have time to repeat that. But we do not underestimate the challenges that also come with this transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority will support workers in emission-intensive industries who are affected by the net zero transition to access new employment or acquire new skills to improve their employment prospects. The authority will also be a partner on behalf of government with industry, communities and investors in getting big transformational projects happening. As the Hunter's coal-fired power stations retire, the authority will work with those employers, with the unions and with the education and training institutions to support workers into new opportunities. This is not just the right thing to do by workers, even though that's a good enough reason in and of itself. It also ensures that we are making good use of the highly skilled workers that we're going to need in this net zero transformation, because the way we navigate economic change is as important as reaching the destination of a net zero economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got to remind the House that Newcastle is not afraid of change. We have the infrastructure, the assets and the industrial smarts to be at the forefront of this transition to a net zero economy. Our existing electricity transmission infrastructure makes connecting new energy into the grid a simpler proposition than in many other regions, because we have a highly skilled workforce that is very experienced in the generation, distribution and storage of energy. This is dangerous work for lots of people. We have generations of people who are trained to handle this situation. We have a world-leading university and high-quality TAFE system. We've got a deepwater port, which is utterly essential for this transition—it's a port that's the envy of a lot of port cities around the world, I'd have to say—along with vast amounts of land that is available around that port. This is a scarce commodity for most Australian ports. That land use will be critical in standing up new industries in this region. And we have a thriving and highly collaborative business community, poised to adapt and take advantage of the opportunities ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of neglect from a government that stuck its head in the sand on climate change and refused to think about how to transition away from fossil fuels and how to work with communities like mine that could be at the very forefront of the work ahead, this Albanese Labor government acknowledges the enormous task ahead, and we have a very, very different approach. We will go to communities like mine and say, 'You can be assured we're not going to be leaving your people behind.' That's why the Albanese Labor government has declared an offshore wind zone covering more than 1,854 square kilometres off the coast of Newcastle. The Hunter offshore wind zone has the potential to generate up to five gigawatts of renewable wind energy—enough to power an estimated 4.2 million homes—and will be a critical source of large-scale, reliable, clean energy for our industrial base. It will create up to 3,120 construction jobs and another 1,560 ongoing operational jobs. It's why we've invested $70 million in Origin to develop a Hunter hydrogen hub in collaboration with Orica.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the first major agreement struck in Australia that would deliver government investments and a commitment to developing a regional hydrogen hub, and it was no accident that this first agreement took place in Newcastle. This hydrogen hub will produce 5,500 tonnes of green hydrogen per year and support good regional job opportunities. This will lead to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions from the site, and it will fuel carbon-free buses and heavy trucks. Becoming a global hydrogen leader requires significant investment, and our $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program will provide an additional revenue support for large-scale renewable hydrogen projects. Two out of the six national hydrogen projects shortlisted come from Newcastle. That is a clear indication of the strength of our region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just north-west of Newcastle, plans are underway to manufacture world-leading solar cells at the old Liddell coal-fired power station. Solar panels are an Australian invention, but fewer than one per cent are manufactured in Australia. We have 3.7 million rooftops covered in solar panels in Australia now—great job—but fewer than one per cent are made in Australia. Our government wants to change that; we want a future made in Australia. Once operational, the new solar manufacturing facility is expected to deliver more jobs than Liddell did as a coal-fired power station. This is a great story to tell in carbon-intensive regions like mine. And these are going to be good, secure jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Port of Newcastle, construction has started on a low-carbon manufacturing plant being built by the amazing local manufacturer MCi Carbon. It will capture CO2 direct from Orica's Kooragang Island manufacturing plant and transform it into building materials like cement and plasterboard. Once operational, it's set to transform more than 1,000 tonnes of CO2 per annum and provide decarbonisation pathways for hard-to-abate sectors, including steel, cement, mining, chemicals and manufacturing. These are all things that are rich in my area and hard to abate. Central to this renewable energy development is the Port of Newcastle. The government has invested $100 million into the port to ensure its hydrogen readiness and to create a landmark clean-energy precinct. For the port, where coal currently represents 94 per cent of our trade exports, the need to diversify has never been more important. Let me say it again: we've got a lot of skin in this game. Novocastrians are up for the change. We will help lead the change. We will help show our metropolitan cousins how it's done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final piece of our puzzle is, of course, skills and education. As we plan for the renewable energy focused future, we cannot overestimate the importance of skills and education to the development of our region. Education and training will be critical to meeting the demands of the new energy sector and our community, and that includes ensuring our higher education facilities, like the TAFE and the University of Newcastle, remain affordable and accessible throughout the Hunter region and are focused on equitable outcomes. We must make sure that our educational institutions are aligned with these principles of equity to deliver good outcomes for both industry and the community. The Albanese government knows this. It's why we provided $16 million to the University of Newcastle to establish a new energy skills hub. It's why we're investing in TAFE centres of excellence to help deliver a skilled workforce for the future. It's why we're investing in more than 600,000 fee-free TAFE places in priority skills areas, 60 per cent of which are being taken up by women. We're supporting new energy apprentices by giving them $10,000 over the course of their apprenticeship to relieve cost-of-living pressures. The Net Zero Economy Authority will be key to this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the authority will be there to support workers in emissions-intensive regions to access new employment and acquire skills to take advantage of the net zero transformation. It will support, develop and deliver educational initiatives for the purpose of promoting an understanding of Australia's transition to net zero and support for social licence for this transition. I don't think any of us in this chamber should underestimate the challenges ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the generation, distribution and storage of electricity, there is now a great opportunity for us to disrupt what traditionally has been a male dominated sector. When I visited Denmark and north-east Scotland to look at their offshore wind industries, I couldn't help but notice that they remained—in the case of Denmark, despite all of the great social policy settings that exist in Nordic countries—very male dominated. With the historical shift from the offshore oil and gas industry to renewables, we in Australia have an opportunity to break that cycle and make sure that women are centred in the renewable energy sector. That makes good economic sense for us. It's why it is supported by local Hunter businesses as well as the big nationals: the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, the Climate Council, the Australian Energy Council, the Australian Industry Group, the Clean Energy Council, the National Farmers Federation, ACOSS, the ACTU, the AMWU, the MUA and the MEU.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, in Newcastle we're not afraid of change. We have been through major industrial upheavals in the past, and we're not intimidated by change on this scale. When BHP closed its doors in Newcastle some 25 years ago, many people here and elsewhere wrote us off. At BHP's peak, 11,000 people worked there—generations of men, including my father, from Newcastle and right across our region. When someone employs 11,000 people, it's a big deal when they shut their doors. While this significant employer and part of our local community was suddenly gone through a decision made in a boardroom overseas, we Novocastrians picked ourselves up, retrained and diversified. We took on new jobs in new industries. Growth and innovation have now made health and education our two biggest employers. Newcastle has continued to flourish. I know that, like in that moment in 1999, Novocastrians are again ready to embrace the new challenges and opportunities ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All this is why the federal government sees Newcastle and the Hunter as such a central place in our nation's energy transformation, and it's why the Net Zero Economy Authority will be so vital to this transition. I give my full support to this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DANIEL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  The member for Newcastle is right when she says that this is an immense job. The scale of it must be acknowledged, but so must the urgency. In a bid to make up for lost time in the competition for investment provoked by President Biden's massive Inflation Reduction Act, the budget bet more than $22 billion to try to get Australia deeper into the clean tech race. The Net Zero Economy Authority is another piece of the process, as we try to make up for lost time. What we know is that, if we're going to succeed, communities affected by the forthcoming transformation of the economy must be brought along with the rest of us. What we also know is that, unless affected communities are treated with dignity and respect, the entire shift to a cleaner, greener future could be put at risk. We're already suffering because of the reweaponisation of action on climate change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians will remember Al Gore's 2006 documentary, <span style="font-style:italic;">An Inconvenient Truth</span>, as one of the first moments when the enormity of the climate change challenge began to sink in. These early national policy debates set in motion what would become a dominant theme in Australian politics for the ensuing two decades, and the climate wars have been, and unfortunately remain, among the most divisive fault lines in our nation's political history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022, the Prime Minister was sworn into office in part on his pledge to end these wars, and, as I said earlier, the Net Zero Economy Authority is one such piece of the process to get on with the job of mitigating climate risk and addressing climate impact. It represents a step in the right policy direction, and it should certainly become a standalone statutory authority. The proposed arrangement is a solid foundation towards a just transition in Australia, but it's just that—a foundation. More can be done now to soften the impact of fossil fuel industrial closure and to pre-emptively prepare an uncertain workforce for this transition. Workers deserve certainty and so does business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the member for Indi's amendments to expand the authority's remit to cover the gamut of affected industries. Once established as a statutory authority, its advice will continue to provide strategic direction to future governments on issues related to cultivating efficient public-private investment and support for a fossil fuel workforce transition. Given the influential powers which the authority's prospective CEO would wield in applying to the Fair Work Commission for a community-of-interest determination, the CEO office holder should be appointed other than by ministerial direction. Australians know all too well the dramatic climate policy shifts which have occurred following a change of government or unpredictable global circumstances. Australia's renewable transition should be sheltered from politics and the day-to-day culture war that often fuels it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's approach to transitioning to net zero is based on a six-sector strategy. As it stands, substance has only been provided for just one of these six—agriculture. Business is attracted to certainty, but the level of policy detail released by the government on our net zero transition is insufficient to provide this. This makes it difficult as Australia considers the net zero transition as a national mission, and that requires deeply entrenched social licence. Broad coordination across government, industry, academia and education is essential to not only achieving our net zero transition targets but ensuring that our country is better off for it and that people understand it. We should help all Australians understand the sense of urgent purpose in this mission, from a fresh chemical engineering graduate to a woman involved in solar panel installation, corporate CEOs and school students of all ages. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A capable, resilient and specialised domestic workforce is required to support maintenance of this transition and this new renewable energy network. Right now government could provide, for example, electrical apprenticeship training and supervised job placements necessary to build the capable workforces that we need. It would be a start if the Commonwealth coordinated an approach which sees regions sharing in these benefits. In fact they must if we're to cultivate the genuine social licence for regional communities living in the vicinity of renewable energy facilities such as solar and wind. Right now, better community outcomes like lower energy prices, expanded community services and new local infrastructure could be delivered for these residents. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to climate change more broadly, I think it's fair to say that members of the Goldstein community that I meet—and there are many of them—are somewhat confused about the approach of this government. At the 2022 election they thought they were getting a government which took the issue seriously, but, when they hear of the recent decision of the government to lock in a significant dependence on gas until at least 2050, they do wonder whether Labor really is serious, because, on the face of it, that announcement is bad news for all of us working for a cleaner, greener future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, this legislation is a step in the right direction. I will support this legislation and, in doing so, I encourage the government to remain future focused rather than to be focused on the past.</span>

Bill had a distinguished political career. The son of a leader of the Queensland parliamentary Labor Party, he was a whip's dream or nightmare, serving in the Queensland's parliament alongside his identical twin brother, Peter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He subsequently moved to Canberra, and in 1989 was elected to the very first ACT Legislative Assembly, eventually representing the seat of Brindabella. He went from doorknocking on Thursday Island to doorknocking in the Tuggeranong Valley. During his time in the Legislative Assembly, Bill served as minister across several portfolios, including arts, urban services, housing and education. So keen was Bill to make an impact on the first day of the new parliament that he leapt to his feet and spoke in the chamber without leave of the Speaker. He served in the assembly until 2004, and then continued to play a significant role across the community. Bill was a man of great integrity in action and in word. The success and longevity of the current ACT government and the stability in federal representation owe much to his work with like-minded colleagues in the late nineties.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I express deep condolences to Bill's wife, Bev, and their family, and to Bill's former staff and friends right across the labour movement.</span>

It's on the banks of the Darling River and it's a town with a wonderful heritage. The people of Wilcannia have been promised a weir to improve the reliability of their water supply and also the amenity of the town. For river towns like Wilcannia, when there's water adjacent to the town the community is in a much better space.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some years ago, David Littleproud, the member for Maranoa, myself and the then New South Wales water minister, Noel Blair, announced the funding for this weir in Wilcannia on the banks of the river. Over a period of time, the New South Wales government liaised and consulted with the community and came up with a proposal to build a weir that would raise the water by an additional metre to what the old weir did. After, I guess, the confusion of the change of government in New South Wales, the bureaucracy changed that to having a weir that will only raise the level to the same as the original one. The people of Wilcannia feel dudded. The lands council, the flood plain graziers and the local shire council are unified in wanting this weir built to the original proposal, and they don't want to be short-changed.</span>

Last week, I spoke at a town hall forum hosted by the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Wilderness Society about the urgent need for stronger environment and nature laws. Hundreds of people attended. Clearly, this matter is important to our communities, who expect us to do much better. At the heart of the forum was our responsibility to protect our environment to safeguard the wellbeing of all Australians and ensure the quality of life and prosperity of future generations. Every delay in passing robust environmental legislation represents a missed opportunity. This is urgent.</span>

The government is setting up Environment Protection Australia, the EPA, and the Environment Information Australia organisation, and I applaud that, but there's still no timetable for the EPBC rewrite. I'll say this again: it's on us. It's our responsibility to the generations who will follow us, because, if not us, who? If not now, when?</span>

We're building on the measures already put in place, like cheaper child care for families and cheaper medicines, and getting wages moving again. In the 2024 budget, we are delivering a tax cut for 72,000 taxpayers in Cunningham. We are giving every household in the Illawarra a $300 energy rebate. We are wiping $3 billion in student debt, including for over 20,000 students in the Illawarra region. We are strengthening Medicare and investing in an additional bulk-billed MRI service in Wollongong. We are investing in local roads and infrastructure. We are supporting vital commuter and freight corridors in our region and improving connectivity between the Illawarra and greater Sydney.</span>

These roads ensure our region can continue to grow our local industries and transport our world-class steel to homes across the country. We are also supporting Wollongong City Council with over $21 million over five years to fix local roads as part of the Roads to Recovery program. We know there's more to do, and I will continue to fight every single day for local families, workers, businesses and the environment.</span>

We have our priorities completely wrong. You only need to look at other countries to see how different it could be.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Norway taxes its gas industry, and it gives university to students for free. We subsidise multinational gas companies, and we charge our students tens of thousands of dollars for degrees. Norway's revenue from multinational oil and gas companies amounts to $23,500 per person per year. Australia's revenue from our multinational oil and gas companies is $200 per person per year. We collect twice as much tax from teachers as we do from our main oil and gas tax. Our beer excise collects more than our main oil and gas tax. This is a wealthy country, but far too few Australians share in that wealth.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the young people of Australia, let me say: we can change that. We can make university more affordable. We can build well-made, affordable homes for people to rent and to buy. We can give you hope for the future again. But to get there, my colleagues need to care less about multinational gas companies and more about Australians. They need to care less about securing their own future and more about the next generation.</span>

With that in mind, I was delighted by the most recent budget handed down by the Treasurer, because it delivers tangible benefits to my constituents. First is the PBS. The last thing we want when we're unwell is a huge bill at the chemist, particularly in these difficult economic times. The 2024-25 budget addresses this. The maximum co-payment for medicines covered by the PBS will remain frozen for all Medicare card holders. Further, co-payments for pensioners and Commonwealth concession card holders will not be indexed again until 1 January 2030. This is great news for my constituents and builds on the government's previous announcement regarding 60-day scripts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this budget also delivers in other ways for the electorate of Werriwa. Medicare coverage will now be extended to an MRI machine in Werriwa, expanding affordable access to these imaging services. The most recent budget announcements, on top of those previously announced that bolster bulk-billing, will ensure that Australia continues to have the world's best health system. That's good news for all Australians but particularly for my constituents.</span>

It was a fabulous and well-attended evening where the community was able to come together and recognise those people and organisations who go the extra mile and give so generously of their time and their skills. I'd like to extend my congratulations to all the nominees and the finalists for this year's awards, and I'd like now to take the opportunity to recognise the winners in their respective categories.</span>

Every week they rescue food from Rusty's Markets that would otherwise go into landfill. It's packed, refrigerated and given away to local charities. I'd like to take the opportunity to congratulate FNQ Volunteers, who were the organisers of this event. It was a great success, and I once again give a big thankyou to all the volunteers across our region for all the outstanding work they do. They certainly make a difference.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  In little more than 33 days, when the clock strikes midnight, millions of Australians will begin to feel the benefits of the Albanese Labor government's tax plan. Under Labor, Australians are earning more and keeping more of what they earn. All 13.6 million Australians will be paying less tax on every dollar they earn. Seventy-four thousand of those in my electorate of Spence will receive a tax cut on average of around $1,200. For many in Spence, that is $1,200 more than they would have received under those opposite. One hundred per cent of taxpayers in Spence will receive a tax cut this financial year because of our government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another one of life's great equalisers is education, which is why the Albanese Labor government's third budget made education a priority. It was a budget that cut $3 billion in student HELP debt, backdating this measure to the last financial year, meaning indexing will fall from 7.1 per cent to 3.2 per cent. This measure is one of many in this budget that help to ease cost-of-living pressures felt not just by the 19,000 people in Spence, who, on average, will receive a $970 credit to their HELP loan debts; this measure also makes the choice easier for the many who might be thinking of undertaking further study or vocational training, helping Australians to learn more and keep more of what they earn.</span>

I recently visited the Women's Legal Service WA, a community legal centre providing services to financially disadvantaged women around WA. I met with chief executive officer Dr Jennie Gray, who explained the main areas of practice were family law, family violence restraining orders and criminal injuries compensation. Additional services include financial counselling, a property legal clinic and regional outreach services.</span>

For the 2023 financial year the service incurred a small loss on revenues of $2.26 million. I call upon the federal Attorney-General to commit increased funding resources to the Women's Legal Service to support its highly valuable, ongoing work fulfilling unmet need in our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  This budget reflects the government's focus both on providing short-term cost-of-living relief and investing in the future. The short-term relief is material but also targeted and proportionate, as reflected by the fact it was funded by a budget in surplus. It includes amendments to the stage 3 tax cuts, which will provide relief to all taxpayers across Australia and far more relief than that offered by those opposite. In fact, 87 per cent of taxpayers in my electorate will do far better under those tax cuts in the budget. Many in my electorate earning between $18,000 and $45,000 would have received zero help under the tax cuts proposed by those opposite. They will receive substantial assistance under the budget this government has put forward. And the RBA and Treasury have both confirmed this won't add to inflationary pressure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The energy subsidy of $300 for households and $325 for small business will help people and small businesses but also put downward pressure on prices at a much-needed time. There's also much-needed additional support through a boost to rental assistance—the first time there has been successive additions to rental assistance in many years. These measures are targeted and well calibrated for the macroeconomic conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the fact the government has an eye to the future, with much-needed investment in training and fee-free TAFE places and in future industries. This budget provides people with the assistance they need now in a fiscally responsible way, and it also invests in the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I am looking forward to the end of the financial year. I don't always look forward to the end of the financial year; I'm not that financially competent at the best of times in my own personal finances. But this year I am looking forward to the end of the financial year because, let me tell you, on 30 June every Australian taxpayer is going to go to bed, go to sleep and wake up, wherever they are, with the figurative white snow of the figurative Christmas in July falling, and under their figurative Christmas tree, figuratively wrapped for them, is going to be a tax cut. Every Australian is going to get a tax cut on 1 July. That's 13.6 million Australians who are going to wake up on the first day of the next financial year with a tax cut wrapped for them and sent with love from the Albanese Labor government. In my electorate, that's 73,000 people who are going to wake up on 1 July with a beautifully figuratively wrapped figurative tax cut for them under their figurative Christmas tree. In the average household, with two workers, that's going to be worth 2,856 bucks a year. That is serious money. That is a serious saving for any family.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know very well that the Leader of the Opposition has been busy with his own version of cuts. He's cut a few people on the other side there. I see the widely respected member for Moore. I understand he's been cut, and I'm sorry for that. We are focused on tax cuts for working Australians. We're focused on cutting the cost of living; the Leader of the Opposition is only focused on cutting his Liberal Party enemies. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  The member for Hawke might be frothing about his tax cut at the end of the financial year, but I've got a simple message for working Australians: Labor are coming for your ute and your family car. That's precisely why they introduced the new fuel efficiency standard, which is just a big new tax on utes and family cars, forcing working Australians away from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles. Families, car dealerships and the car industry didn't get a voice on this one; Labor drove straight over the top of the democratic process and rammed it through parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken to people across the Peel region in WA and they've told me how much this tax will hurt them. It will add thousands of dollars to their new ute or family SUV. People in my community rely on Ford Rangers and Everests, Toyota HiLuxes, Mitsubishi Outlanders, Nissan Pathfinders, and Isuzu D-MAXes and MU-Xes. These are the workhorses that get them and their families around. They need them for work—especially tradies and farmers. They need them to tow their boats and caravans. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this isn't just a new Labor tax on utes and family cars; this is a tax on small business and our unique recreational lifestyle. It's a tax on everyday working Australians to force them from petrol and diesel cars to electric cars. It's simple: Labor's plan is to de-industrialise Australia, make us less competitive as a nation and look after their big business mates with green subsidies. Shame on you!</span>

This measure will impact 23,430 people in my electorate, and I thank all of those in Chisholm who've advocated for change in this area. </span>

This is Hitchens's razor, created to refute religious dogma, and I bring it out again to dismiss the political preachings of the ABC's Laura Tingle, specifically her attack on Australia at the Sydney Writers Festival. We are a great country. That statement is self-evident. We are not a racist country. That, too, is a statement that needs no defence. I will always stand up for Australia and this side of the House will always stand up for Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only statements requiring evidence now are any claims as to Ms Tingle's professional integrity. She holds the beliefs, which she expressed at the writers festival, that Australian taxpayers are racist. How can she possibly justify continuing to draw her taxpayer funded wage from them? There is no integrity at all in that position. The only credible path would be to renounce her salary, with the same readiness and disdain with which she denounced my beautiful country, and give Australians their money back. Of course, I do not expect this to happen—but rather for her to continue enjoying Australia's bounty while pouring contempt on those who provide it. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do have something very much to thank her for. She has given us a source of entertainment, a feat that the ratings tell us the ABC regularly struggles to achieve. Ms Tingle presents herself as a non-partisan journalist, and I, for one, find that quite funny. </span>

We can run the country, we can deliver a budget surplus, we can bring down the debt and we can take up wages. What that means for the people in my part of the world, in Paterson, is that 75,000 hardworking people will get a tax cut on 1 July. And I tell you, when you're budgeting, every dollar counts in Australia. It also means that 87 per cent of people in Paterson will be better off under the Albanese Labor government. It means that over 260,000 people can go and get an MRI scan—and I've just busted my ACL, so I know how important they are—and be bulk-billed. It means than 10,000 people have additionally been bulk-billed in Paterson, thanks to Anthony Albanese and the Labor government. </span>

But, for too many, this has been a very bad experience. On the most recent published numbers, it takes Services Australia 82½ days to process a low-income card claim, compared to 16 days when the coalition left office. If you call Services Australia you better be patient. Those who call the disability, sickness and carers line wait, on average, more than 48 minutes. The figure was 21 minutes under the coalition. Labor's solution is to hire an extra 7,500 bureaucrats. They've already increased headcount while in government, while service levels have dropped.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Labor is hiring more staff it is letting the digital capabilities of Services Australia stagnate. Ninety per cent of all customer interactions with Services Australia are through the digital channel, but funding over the forward estimates for Services Australia's technology and transformation program will decline. Automation processes for key Centrelink payments have been turned off, the guts have been ripped out of the agency's digital program suite, more than a thousand specialist ICT workers have been let go and an axed contract with Serco has reduced the telephony capacity of the agency.</span>

The echoes dance around their hollow party room. Some of them said they'll oppose it.

Section 501 has not changed. And I'll make this point: since coming to government, we have deported over 4,200 individuals from immigration detention. In our first year of government, the number of individuals we deported from immigration detention was almost double the number the previous government deported the year prior. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The AAT makes decisions independently of government to overturn some visa cancellations. As the minister has said, he'll be reviewing the recent AAT decisions and, where necessary and appropriate, he'll overrule them. The parliament yesterday passed legislation abolishing the rorted AAT and replacing it with the new Administrative Review Tribunal. The only effective way of ensuring that tribunal members are making better decisions is to issue a new, revised direction, which the minister will be doing. The new directive will ensure that the protection of the community outweighs any other considerations.</span>

The tribunal cited direction 79 and the higher level of tolerance as an important reason. During the same period, the tribunal decided a Brazilian man found guilty of armed robbery and assault, and the subject of an AVO sought by his girlfriend, should have his visa restored. This decision in 2018 cited the higher level of tolerance in direction 65 of this minister. In another ruling, the tribunal sided with a Nigerian heroin dealer, known as HMDS—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:05</span>):  I thank the member for Solomon for his very important question, for his service to our Australian Defence Force and for his work supporting the 5,500 veterans in his community. When we came to government, DVA was underresourced, it was underfunded and it was facing a crisis. There was a backlog of some 42,000 claims in the department that had not even been looked at. As the former government veterans' affairs minister, the member for Calare said on radio this morning, 'At this time the government was only prioritising funding that had a political advantage.' So they didn't feel there was a political advantage in funding veterans' issues. This was such a dire situation the previous minister threatened to resign over it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The vast majority of claims that are brought are under the MRCA. The first step is establishing initial liability. Back in 2022-23, it took on average 332 days just to allocate a claim to someone for them to look at it. It took a further average of 113 days for that claim to be determined, which meant in 2022-23 the average time to process claims was 441 days. Addressing this crisis is why the government have made the investments that we have. DVA is now better funded than it had been in three decades. We funded 500 additional APS in the October 2022 budget to get about clearing that backlog. We have added funding for 141 permanent staff in the budget this year. The use of labour hire to process claims has fallen from a third to just 10 people. As of right now, it takes 14 days—no more—for that claim I mentioned to be looked at. On average, since 1 December, it takes six days. The average time taken to determine a claim, since 1 December 2023, is now 44 days. That means it is an average of 60 days now to process a MRCA initial liability claim. Of course, there are claims that a more complex and where further medical information might be sought. It does take some time for those claims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's appreciated that due to the backlog we inherited some people have been waiting far too long—indeed, years—for their claims to be processed. That's why we've put in the work to get these claims assessed as quickly as possible. It's the processing of this backlog of claims that we inherited that means we are spending an additional $6.5 billion over five years to give veterans the benefits that they deserve. It's why it is so concerning that some say the government should be cutting back on the staff that it has, which would result in veterans getting fewer benefits. This is not about politics; it's about doing the right thing.</span>

Chinese national MJVS's visa was cancelled following a conviction for possessing images and videos police described as at the most extreme end of child abuse material, including material depicting newborn babies. The Albanese Labor government's watering-down of the law has allowed this criminal to stay in Australia, making our country less safe. When will the Albanese Labor government apologise for this catastrophic mistake and reverse direction 99?</span>

The Leader of the Opposition is still yet to tell us why he—not a court, not a tribunal; it was his delegate—released a detainee from detention who went on to allegedly commit a violent crime.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government continues to refuse and cancel visas on character grounds. I continue to cancel AAT set-asides. Section 501 has not changed. The Albanese government has always said that visa decisions need to be guided by two clear principles: firstly, the protection of the Australian community, and, secondly, common sense. A number of recent AAT decisions have not shown common sense. Yesterday the parliament passed legislation to abolish the AAT and replace it with a new administrative review tribunal. The Albanese government is delivering an accessible, sustainable, trusted and truly independent federal administrative review system that will serve the best interests of the Australian people.</span>

The new direction will ensure that all members of the ART will adopt a common-sense approach to visa decisions, consistent with the intent of ministerial direction 99. First and foremost, this means ensuring that the protection of the community outweighs other considerations.</span>

On 9 February 2021, former prime minister Morrison attended RAAF Base Williamtown for a defence announcement. For those opposite, the substance of that announcement was less important than the theatre. We had <span style="font-style:italic;">Top Gun</span> music. We had pageantry. We had hoopla. A year earlier, on 4 January, at the height of the Black Summer bushfires, those opposite produced an ad featuring the Australian Defence Force to raise money for the Liberal Party. These two incidents characterise the essence of the Liberals. As they see it, defence is all about politics; defence is all about them. But, while all of this was happening, our veterans, the men and women who have worn our nation's uniform, were suffering.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:18</span>):  My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Water. EVs are fuelled by solar panels from China, where production and smelting belch out vast clouds of CO2. Ethanol motor vehicles emit CO2 but the sugarcane crop absorbs back these emissions. Minister, wasn't Morris Iemma right in introducing ethanol, referring to petrols as carcinogens? I won't go another day with peoples' deaths on my conscience—people that did not have to die. Brazil's petrol, at 49 per cent ethanol, sells for $1.10 a litre. Australia's petrol imports are $48 billion a year. Doesn't this magic-wand a richer, cleaner, more affordable Australia? </span>

I understand the member for Kennedy is asking about air quality and the better air quality we would get with reduced carbon based fuels.

Of course it's about cheaper, more efficient fuel use in vehicles but it's also about better air quality.</span>

                  </a>  The member for Kennedy is quite right—millions of hectares of the Mitchell grass plain are covered in prickly acacia, which of course competes with other types of native grasses and plants but also reduces the habitat that our native animals have to make their homes. They can't get through the prickly acacia. He has spoken to me before about the potential use of these woody weeds as a source of bioethanol, and of course that's something very worth exploring. The minister for infrastructure and transport and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy are both very actively exploring opportunities for bioethanol and other biofuels. Indeed, the minister for training is also supporting apprentices to upskill in the areas of biofuels, including ethanol.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd say our government is working to reduce those woody weeds, through my portfolio of the environment. We're spending millions of dollars dealing with problems like prickly acacia and also gamba grass—a huge problem right across the north of Australia. It again competes with native species and reduces habitat for certain plants and animals but is also a huge fire risk. We know that, when gamba grass and other types of introduced grasses take off in places like Kakadu National Park and Litchfield National Park, they burn hotter than native vegetation—so the impact of fires is much worse when we've got those invasive species.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with the member for Kennedy that these are ideas worth exploring. I'm sure the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy would be happy to talk with him. One other thing I want to tell him is the CSIRO has recently been looking at microalgae as a source of bioethanol. I know he is very interested in asparagopsis seaweed and its introduction into feedstock for cattle and the potential to reduce methane emissions. Here's microalgae for fuel. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That's a cost to government but it's a cost which we owe those veterans; they've earned it by wearing our uniform, defending our nation and honouring us with their presence. This is long overdue money, and if you don't have staff and you're not processing claims then people aren't getting it. That was what was going on under the former government.</span>

The fact is that, when we took office in May 2022, and when the minister undertook the role he was appointed to, we inherited a backlog of 42,000 compensation claims. That's 42,000 veterans who had defended our nation who were waiting on claims. Tragically, some of them never got to receive them. It's no wonder the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Calare, threatened to resign as the minister before that last budget in 2022. He said this was 'having an appalling effect on the physical and mental health of our veterans'. He argued for funding in the former government, but, he said, 'They didn't feel there was a political advantage in funding veterans' issues.' So they did nothing.</span>

New Zealand citizen Troy had his visa cancelled following convictions for serious assaults against women and children, including hitting a three-year-old disabled toddler in the head. The Albanese Labor government's watering down of the law has allowed this criminal to stay in Australia, making our country less safe. When will the Albanese Labor government apologise for this catastrophic mistake and revoke direction 99?</span>

The Albanese Labor government is committed to supporting former defence personnel, veterans and their families. In my portfolio, we are delivering targeted cost-of-living relief, including to veterans. Today, I introduced a bill that will deliver an increase to the maximum rate of rent assistance by a further 10 per cent. This is our second consecutive increase and means that, on 20 September, the maximum rate of rent assistance will have increased by 40 per cent since this government was elected. This support will help close to a million households, including 13,000 veterans and dependents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government have also announced we will freeze social security deeming rates for a further 12 months so that part-pensioners, including 96,000 service pensioners and income recipients, can keep more of their payment. In the budget we have also announced a freeze on the price of PBS medicines for concession cardholders so that they will pay a maximum of $7.70 per script for the next five years. That will benefit—this might be of interest to those on the other side—330,000 veterans and dependants. In last year's budget, our government made a record investment in Medicare. We tripled the veterans access payment for those on a white card or a gold card, helping 290,000 veterans get better access to a GP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government's approach has been supporting people, including veterans, right around the country. This stands in stark contrast to those opposite. Just a few weeks ago, we had the member for Hume, who signalled that, if he were Treasurer, there would be a question around whether indexation would flow to pensioners and veterans, as he vowed to cut so-called unrestrained spending. I've got news for the member for Hume: indexation is a critical part of ensuring that pensioners' and veterans' payments keep up with the cost of living. It is insulting that he thinks this indexation is so-called discretionary spending.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that the coalition has form. They cut pensions and payments, including veterans' payments, when this Leader of the Opposition was in the cabinet. Those opposite have done it before; they'll do it again. It is our government that stands up on the side of veterans, ensuring they get the support they need when they need it.</span>

Iranian national YVBM's visa was cancelled following domestic violence convictions, including for kicking his pregnant partner and threatening to 'hurt her so badly that she will not be able to walk again'. The Albanese Labor government's watering down of the law has allowed this criminal to stay in Australia, making our country less safe. When will the Albanese Labor government apologise for this catastrophic mistake and revoke direction 99?</span>

It's not a commentary time, because that's the way question time and the standing orders should operate. Moving forward, I've been pretty lenient in allowing points of order and enabling them to be heard, but, if the interjections continue, people will not remain here for question time.</span>

                  </a>  I'll deal with the point of order that was raised by the honourable member for Kooyong with respect to standing order 100(d)(i). This question didn't name anyone. It had a reference in it. So it is different to the others. I appreciate the point that you're making about when names are issued, but there has been a long practice in the House, whether it be with owners of businesses, whether it be with community representatives—it's up to the member to make sure they are accurate and verified. So the question will stand. In this particular case, he didn't mention anyone's name. I'll just ask the minister to answer the question.</span>

One of the things that we are proudest of in our first three budgets is the support that we've been able to show for Australia's veterans—not the platitudes and place holders that we heard from those opposite but real dollars, making a real difference. Here I want to acknowledge the efforts of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs; the Assistant Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Thistlethwaite; the Minister for Defence; the Prime Minister; and the Minister for Finance, in the other place. All of us on this side of the House respect and recognise the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, and we take seriously our responsibilities to them after they leave the military. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to office, there was a backlog of 42,000 claims. These weren't just abstract numbers on a spreadsheet, but they were real people with real families who have made and continue to make a real contribution to our country. Those opposite should be ashamed of themselves for leaving those veterans hanging for so long. We were determined to clean up the mess when we came to office, with $230 million in our first budget for staff to process the claims and now another $477 million in this budget to fix the system as well. Because of our efforts, an extra $6½ billion will flow into the pockets of our veterans, who deserve every single cent of our support. The shadow Treasurer thinks this is overspending, but we don't. Those opposite diminish the efforts of the public servants who are working around the clock to get this money to the veterans who deserve it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Support for veterans is part of our efforts in the budget to help with the cost of living, and today's inflation numbers show why that's so important. As I said yesterday, the monthly inflation figures are more volatile and they don't compare the same goods and services, and that's why they bounce around. This month, petrol, private health insurance and international travel were some of the biggest influences. Our expectations for inflation and our forecasts aren't changed by today's data. Electricity prices were up 4.2 per cent, but that would have been 13.9 per cent were it not for the rebates that those opposite voted against when they voted for even higher inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to office, inflation had a six in front of it, and now it has a three in front of it. It has moderated overall, but we need it to moderate further and faster, and that's why the budget had such a big focus on fighting inflation and easing cost-of-living pressures. Our support for our veterans is a really important part of those efforts.</span>

She's a passionate advocate for new energy jobs in the regions. The member for Newcastle and her Hunter colleagues know the opportunities that this policy provides for Australia because they are living those opportunities. They're living them, like at the Liddell Power Station, where the Australian company SunDrive, in response to our Future Made in Australia policy, has announced their plans to open a manufacturing facility. That site will employ more people than were ever employed at the Liddell Power Station.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are the opportunities that we, the Albanese government, are seizing on the nation's behalf, and last week I had the opportunity to see more of those opportunities. In Adelaide, for example, 5B and Tindo Solar are two great Australian solar companies that will be expanding and creating jobs in response to our Solar Sunshot policy, announced in the budget, and in Gladstone I can see the hydrogen opportunities. Of course, Gladstone is a green hydrogen hub under this government, as are Whyalla, Bell Bay and other sites around the country. These are the opportunities that our regions have, and we make no apologies for concentrating on those regions that are going through economic change—for example, where coal-fired power stations will close. The honourable member asked me about what policies we'll reject.</span>

                  </a>  I was asked what policies we'll reject. I have heard rumours of an alternative policy but am yet to see any alternative policy. The rumours of an alternative policy are nuclear power plants in areas where there are coal-fired power plants. The Leader of the Opposition hasn't been within a hundred kilometres of any coal-fired power plants since he became Leader of the Opposition, so he hasn't really been engaging in good consultation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw a report last week which underlines why we reject this policy. That was the <span style="font-style:italic;">GenCost</span> report by the CSIRO, which showed again that nuclear power plants are expensive and slow to build. Those opposite were falling over themselves to discredit the CSIRO, led by the member for New England, who explained in his normal methodical, calm manner that you can't trust the CSIRO because they're Australian. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That got me thinking. CSIRO started GenCost in 2018, when the opposition were in office, and GenCost has consistently shown that nuclear is the most expensive form of energy, including while the opposition were in office. That got me thinking: I wonder what the member for New England thought about it when they were in government? Well, he was asked by David Speers, 'Is nuclear under consideration?' and he said: 'It's not. It's been ruled out by reason of cost.' David Speers went on and said: 'You're in government. You're no less than the Deputy Prime Minister. Why don't you give it a push?' Joyce said, 'Because the cost is too high.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder what's changed. Sometimes in politics you can overlearn a lesson and you can overcorrect. We were very critical of the then government for having 22 energy policies. We thought 22 were too many. But we didn't mean have zero. One is the sweet spot. Have an energy policy. If the Leader of the Opposition was any good he could release an energy policy. He could at least be up to that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Orange Seniors Village Hub provides support, education and community for many seniors in Orange, New South Wales, yet funding for the village hub program has been cut, with no support for it in the recent budget. This has devastated our seniors. Orange City Council has confirmed that the alternative funding your department has suggested does not cover seniors and will not support the Orange Seniors Village Hub. Will you restore funding to the Orange Seniors Village Hub and support seniors in Orange and across our region? </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as a government, we are absolutely committed to net zero and to Australia doing its share to help the globe get to net zero. We have set an 82 per cent renewable energy target. It is ambitious but we are working day and night to get there. So far, since coming to government, we have ticked off 47 renewable energy projects. That is enough to power three million homes. And the good news is, I have another 136 renewable energy projects in the pipeline in front of me. What is exciting about this is we have managed to speed up the approval of onshore wind projects, for example. We are doing them three times faster than they were done under those opposite. If you look at our total approvals across all types of projects, we have actually doubled on-time approvals since coming to government and, importantly, we have done it without compromising environmental standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have approved terrific projects like the Punchs Creek Solar Farm—enough to power 300,000 homes in Queensland—and the Yanco Delta Wind Farm—enough to power 700,000 homes in New South Wales. We are investing through the $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia plan close to $9 billion for green hydrogen, close to half billion dollars for batteries, about $1 billion for solar panels and, very importantly, support for critical minerals, because we know that critical minerals are absolutely essential in the transition to a net zero economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the difference? Those opposite had 10 years, and they were told that 24 coal-fired power stations were closing and they did nothing to actually replace that generation capacity. Now they have come up with a $387 billion nuclear fantasy and, on top of that, they are now saying that these projects should not even be subject to John Howard's old environmental laws. So, under those opposite, if you are a coal or gas project or you are nuclear, you get the fast track but if you are a renewable energy project you are in the slow lane.</span>

The Albanese government is absolutely determined to deliver a future made in Australia. Part of that future is the critical minerals processing industry. Make no mistake, the budget delivered by the Treasurer is the most significant budget for the future of the resources sector in this country in a generation. Traditional resources commodities like iron ore, coal and LNG are the backbone of our economy, and they will support the emerging critical minerals and rare-earth elements sector in the global drive to net zero. The $17 billion production tax incentive will drive critical minerals processing and value-adding in Australia. It is a serious and measured down payment on Australia taking up our responsibility to lead on critical minerals globally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might say, it has drawn some pretty special comments from those opposite. The shadow Treasurer has likened the production tax incentive to giving a dollar to every cafe owner for every coffee they produce. I've got to say, I have a lot of respect for the baristas in this country. They are great small businesses and are vital to national productivity. But I reckon producing lithium hydroxide, vanadium pentoxide, or nickel sulphate is a little bit more complex than producing a latte. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the shadow Treasurer has missed the point entirely that a production tax incentive for processed critical minerals is a zero risk approach for Australia. If companies don't produce a value-added product, they don't receive a tax credit. But, if they do add value to products in Australia, it means that they have grown our sovereign capability, attracted investment, contributed to diversified supply chains, contributed to value-adding onshore and grown new jobs—all this in regions and industrial centres right across the country. What does the coalition say to all that? 'Absolutely not—we won't have any of that.' What does industry say? Rob Scott from Wesfarmers chemicals and fertilisers said this is:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… smart, targeted use of the tax system to solve big problems, leverage our competitive advantages and enhance Australia's prosperity. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have other leaders said? 'We will support this measure.' That was Libby Mettam, the Leader of the WA Liberals. Another leader has said, 'It is essential not just for Western Australia and not just for Australia but for the western world to pursue production tax incentives like this.' Who was that? The member for Maranoa might be interested that it was Shane Love, the Leader of the Nationals in Western Australia. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are more than a few members opposite who might want to be concerned about the bubble that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer have gone into in opposing the resources sector in this country. The member for O'Connor, the member for Durack, the member for Parkes, the member for Flynn and others all have critical mineral mines in their electorate and— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He's a long-term advocate for some of the concerns that are out there in the community when it comes to gambling, right across the board, in all of its forms. The government has done more in our two years than those opposite did in their almost decade in office. This is what we have done. We've launched BetStop, the national self-exclusion register. We have mandated customer pre-verification for all new online wagering accounts to prevent children from gambling and strengthen protections for Australians who have registered for BetStop. We've agreed with the states and territories for new minimum classifications for video games with gambling-like content. We've implemented new, evidence based taglines to replace the 'Gambling responsibly' taglines that were previously there that were ineffective. We've introduced nationally consistent staff training. We've required online wagering companies to send their customers monthly activity statements, outlining wins and losses. We've legislated a ban on the use of credit cards for gambling.</span>

We're working through it in an orderly way. We're consulting all the appropriate groups, including gambling groups. I've met with a range of stakeholders, including people like Tim Costello and others, about these issues. We want to make sure there's a comprehensive approach to tackling gambling harm, not that you just shut down one thing in order to get something then just appear online from offshore, which is one of the concerns which are there. We want to make sure that we get it right. That's why we're undertaking this work in the characteristically orderly, measured and considered way that this government operates.</span>

He has been a long-time supporter of making sure we get more homes on the ground. He understands that Australia doesn't have enough homes, and we haven't had enough homes for a long time. He knows how important it is that we build more homes. Indeed, we need to build more homes more quickly in more parts of the country.</span>

We've committed now $32 billion in new housing initiatives since we came to office, including more than $6 billion in our most recent budget. There are homes already on the ground today and under construction because of the decisions we have taken as a government in places like Western Sydney, where the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and I were last week, where we were hearing about the progress and seeing the progress of more than 400 new homes in Westmead—new affordable rental homes for key workers.

I met with people like Glenda in Riverwood in New South Wales and like Nanna Pam and Kevin and Leanne in Latrobe in their new homes, where they spoke to me about how important it is for them to have a safe, secure and affordable roof over their heads.</span>

It's why we're working with the housing sector, with the construction sector and, importantly, with the other tiers of government, particularly the states and territories. We need to get more homes on the ground more quickly, but it will take everybody with their shoulder to the wheel to meet our nation's ambitious housing target of 1.2 million homes from 1 July to the end of the decade. It is ambitious because it needs to be. We need to add to supply because supply is the answer to our housing challenges. We know that, and the experts know that, but apparently those opposite don't seem to know it. They voted against more homes when they voted against our Housing Australia Future Fund. They're voting against getting more people into homeownership with our Help to Buy shared-equity scheme. We hear they're not going to have a target. They didn't offer in their budget reply one new dollar for one new home. They have very little to offer except negativity.</span>

Those opposite should be getting on board with our Homes for Australia Plan. They should be supporting it because it will provide more help for homebuyers, more help for renters and more homes for Australians that need it most.</span>

New Zealand citizen Dawson Rawiri's visa was cancelled following serious domestic violence convictions, including for punching his wife so hard he split her eyelid and physically assaulting his 15-year-old son. The Albanese Labor government's watering down of the law has allowed this criminal to stay in the country, making Australia less safe. When will the Albanese Labor government apologise for this catastrophic mistake and revoke direction 99?</span>

As I have said previously in question time today, I will be issuing a new, revised ministerial direction. Part of that is to ensure that visa decisions are guided by these two principles: protection of the community and common sense. As I said in answer to an earlier question, there will be a higher focus on these than has been the case in the past. I'm sure the Leader of the Opposition, when he was listening to the examples that the Prime Minister put to him, was reflecting on how previous ministerial directions under him might have been improved too. These are changes that will improve decision-making.</span>

But if people are on warnings, trust me: if I hear you interjecting, you won't be here, no matter which side of the chamber or wherever you're sitting in the chamber. I am very lenient when it comes to people getting to warnings, but once you're on a warning—I thank the deputy leader for reminding the House and assisting my job to remind people that if you're on a warning, don't interject.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in Wollongong, and in all of our regions, know that our Future Made in Australia policy will be a boon for the regions. Under our Future Made in Australia policy, one of the priority initiatives outlined in the budget was the development of an Australian low-carbon liquid fuel industry. This will help hard-to-abate transport sectors like aviation and heavy haulage to reduce their emissions, while creating new jobs and opportunities in the country. There is money for innovation and certification, and, shortly, we will be consulting on options to introduce a production incentive to kickstart local manufacturing of fuel, including the supply of Australian feedstock like canola and sugar cane waste. Currently over 60 per cent of canola exported to Europe is used to produce biofuels, and 400 kilotonnes of tallow exported to Europe the same—that we then import back in at some cost for these industries.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can do this here, and our industry agrees. Bioenergy Australia says our policies 'will create jobs in regional Australia, boost economic growth, bolster energy security and futureproof our tourism and transport sectors'. GrainCorp said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked about what approaches we've rejected. We've rejected what those opposite think of regional industries and support for manufacturing in our regional industries, that saw our car industry leave our shores. We're rejecting calls to ditch local production, to support local incentives for production, and to destroy our aluminium industry. Back in 2012, during a presentation to the Minerals Council of Australia, the now shadow Treasurer—a great champion for manufacturing in our regions, apparently—advocated the scrapping of all local content policies and the closure of aluminium refining in Australia. That's what the shadow Treasurer said. This is an industry that employs 3,500 Australians and exported 1.5 million tonnes of aluminium worth $5.2 billion to our economy in 2023. The shadow Treasurer apparently called our local industry uncompetitive and, similarly, weak. Where the Albanese government is working to deliver a future made in Australia, the coalition wants a future made overseas. They want to close down our industries. We want a future made in Australia, including in our regions.</span>

Yesterday in Senate estimates the Secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services stated that he disclosed a conflict of interest to the Parliamentary Service Commissioner in relation to a relationship he had with a direct report but that he did not have a romantic relationship with her at that time. According to his evidence, almost a year later he disclosed the conflict of interest to you and the President of the Senate when there was a romantic relationship. Can you confirm that the conversation with the secretary and the President was the first you were made aware of the conflict? Do you believe that the declaration of a conflict of interest was made to you in a timely manner, given that it was made almost a year after it was raised with the Parliamentary Service Commissioner?</span>

                  <a href="261393" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  Australia is often called the land of opportunity, where each and every one of us has the chance to thrive and reach our full potential. Yet there exists a stark divide in health outcomes between people who live in cities and those who call the bush home. In fact, the further away you live from a city the sooner you're likely to die—and that's the cold, hard truth. Statistics from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reveal that, devastatingly, people who live in very remote areas die about 15 years earlier than their city cousins. With close to one-third of the Australian population living in the regions, how can this possibly be? The answer is simple: country people have less access to doctors such as GPs, who are often the first point of contact when someone feels sick or has a health problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had many people across my electorate of Calare and beyond contact me about the shortage of doctors in rural and regional Australia. Dr John England OAM is a consultant physician and cardiologist. With heart specialists leaving Dubbo and Bathurst and no word of replacements, he services large parts of the Central West. He recently held a free vaccination clinic in Gulgong, a town of 2,000 people which once had four doctors and now has none, with no sign of any doctors moving there. He sees patients with serious heart conditions from Rylstone and Kandos who face a year-long wait to see a cardiologist in Orange. He writes, 'They would be dead waiting,' if he didn't see them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris Prest from Canowindra wrote to me regarding the imminent closure of the Canowindra medical practice in June this year. The only other doctors in Canowindra have closed their books due to being full. Chris writes: 'The loss of a doctor is a very significant event in a small town, with a massive impact. If the doctor is not replaced, I can see the ED at Canowindra hospital being overwhelmed by people seeking medical treatment usually provided by their local doctor.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jennifer Hughan from Orange contacted my office about the extensive wait times for children in the area requiring an ear, nose and throat specialist. Her four-year-old daughter faced a seven-month wait to see an ENT specialist and now faces at least a one-year wait for surgery in Orange. One thousand children are currently waiting for ENT surgery in town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The devastating regional doctor shortage has been made much worse by the government's changes to the distribution priority area system in 2022. Originally, overseas trained doctors who moved to Australia were required to practise in the bush for several years. Now, they are allowed to practise in city areas, like Hornsby, Warringah, Fairfield and Penrith. According to the Department of Health and Aged Care, in the six months following the changes to the DPA, the number of GPs that moved away from country practice jumped by more than 55 per cent on previous years. The Mayor of Blayney Shire Council, Scott Ferguson, has reiterated, 'This is simply devastating for health services in country areas like Blayney.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to ruining the DPA system, the government scrapped the planned Western Sydney University regional training hub at Bathurst. If we are to solve this crisis, there needs to be agreement across Capital Hill that country people deserve the same access to medical services as people in the cities. Evidence has shown that, if you train doctors in the bush, they will be very likely to stay and practise in the bush. That's why I strongly advocated to get the CSU medical school in Orange up and running. Places at the medical school are in high demand, with around 1,000 people applying for just over 30 places on offer each year. That's why it was shocking that, at a time when the shortage of doctors in country areas had never been more acute, the government did not award the CSU medical school with any additional Commonwealth supported places last year. This is disgraceful. The government needs to get serious about alleviating the rural doctor shortage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris Prest from Canowindra, whom I quoted earlier, also said in her letter to me, 'Too frequently politics can get in the way of solving the problem, which is very annoying.' I couldn't agree more. But, as Chris and everyone in the country knows, it's more than annoying. To regional, remote and rural people, it's fatal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together in this House and the other place, we have the power to cure this crisis. Country people demand and deserve nothing less than equality in access to doctors and medical services. Lives are at stake, and immediate action from the government is required. Get on with it on the double.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="248353" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention and Assistant Minister for Rural and Regional Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  I thank the member for Calare for moving this MPI today and for his genuine and deep interest in this issue. I spent time in both Orange and Bathurst last July, meeting with some of the dedicated local health professionals in his electorate, people delivering vital healthcare services, such as those provided through the new endometriosis and pelvic pain clinic in Orange and Marathon Health in Bathurst. I also visited the Bathurst rural clinical school, which is training health professionals of the future for that region and regions like it. We know how important regional training is because, as the member for Calare has said, local medical graduates are far more likely to stay and work in communities that they grew up in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important MPI, and it's an issue that I've been acutely aware of since well before my time in this place. I worked in regional pharmacy. I worked in a regional hospital. I worked at Wyong hospital, on the Central Coast of New South Wales, in my electorate. Over the nearly 10 years I worked there, I saw firsthand the challenges of attracting and retaining the health workforce required to give Australians living in rural and remote communities the health care that they expect and that they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia today, the life expectancy for women living in the most remote parts of Australia is 19 years below that of their city counterparts. That's before we look at the quality of life. This is unacceptable. A big part of this is to do with access to timely, affordable care closer to home. Every member of our government supports strong and prosperous rural and regional communities. Every member of our government wants to see the seven million Australians living outside our major cities have access to quality, affordable care. We know that access to quality care underpins healthy and strong communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the policy response to this challenge is what matters, and it's not the six-year long freeze to the bulk-billing incentive that we got from the Leader of the Opposition when he was health minister and it's not back-of-the-envelope migration policy which would threaten one of the most important sources of rural and regional doctors that we have—international medical graduates. This challenge demands rational, well-thought-out policy which strengthens the health system as a whole and responds to the unique health needs of rural and regional communities. This is the approach of our government, through significant investment and comprehensive programs that we are rolling out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong Medicare supports people across rural, regional and remote Australia to get the care they need closer to home, while taking the pressure off stretched emergency departments and easing cost-of-living pressures. The government's commitment to improving access to health care across Australia is reflected in the 2024-25 budget, which provided $2.8 billion to continue to strengthen Medicare. This was in addition to the historic $6.1 billion investment in Medicare in the 2023-24 budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The beating heart of Medicare, as the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mark Butler, has said, is bulk-billing. As members well know, bulk-billing was in absolute freefall when we came to government. A $3.5 billion investment to triple the bulk-billing incentive has stopped the slide in the few short months since it came into effect. Since 1 November last year, the GP bulk-billing rate has risen by 3.9 per cent in regional, rural and remote areas. What this increase in the bulk-billing rate means in regional Australia is an estimated 550,000 additional trips to the GP bulk-billed since 1 November last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this increase hasn't just helped patients; it has strengthened general practice and given more doctors the confidence to work in regional communities and to bulk-bill patients who need it most. In my electorate of Dobell on the Central Coast of New South Wales, we have seen bulk-billing jump by 5.8 per cent since November, a major rise in such a short time. In the member for Calare's electorate, the bulk-billing rate has risen from 79.6 per cent to 81.4 per cent in the same time. That's four out of five trips to the GP being bulk-billed on the back of higher incentive payments to GPs under Medicare—a significant boost in access to affordable and quality care close to home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another flagship initiative of the Albanese Labor government to strengthen Medicare is the Medicare urgent care clinics, with an additional 29 funded in the 2024-25 budget. This will bring the total number of Medicare urgent care clinics across the country to 87, offering walk-in care seven days a week, over extended hours, completely bulk-billed. Medicare urgent care clinics are making a difference for patients and for stretched hospital emergency departments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at the Cessnock Medicare Urgent Care Clinic with the member for Hunter, Dan Repacholi, and I met a nurse there. She was the triage nurse for the Medicare urgent care clinic that day. She was working there because she had come to the urgent care clinic with her daughter as a patient. She was so impressed by the Medicare urgent care clinic model that she asked to speak to the practice manager. The practice manager said to me, 'We are so fortunate to have an experienced, capable nurse, and she came because she was a parent of a patient and saw this model and saw the difference that it's making in that community.' That's what we're seeing right across the country, particularly in regional and remote communities. They're making a big difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ten of the 58 Medicare urgent care clinics already operating around the country are in regional, rural and remote areas, and I visited many of them. They are boosting access to primary care, making it affordable for people and giving them a trusted alternative to the emergency department. About a third of presentations to Medicare urgent care clinics are children under 15, which shows that parents and caregivers trust Medicare urgent care clinics as a safe alternative to the emergency department for their young people. So far, these 10 Medicare urgent care clinics in the more regional and remote parts of Australia have seen over 40,000 presentations. Those are 40,000 visits fully bulk-billed and walk-ins without an appointment, making such a big difference to individuals and families and reducing the demands on our stretched emergency departments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I was in Rockhampton to announce a boost in funding for their Medicare urgent care clinic. In the budget, we're enhancing funding to Medicare urgent care clinics outside of our major cities, acknowledging the cost of resources and attracting workforce in those communities. That clinic has already seen more than 5,000 patients since opening in December. It is also really important to note that this practice was a GP practice at risk of closure. It was the only GP practice in that community that was bulk-billing. Since the introduction of the Medicare urgent care clinic model, ForHealth have recruited, I believe, six additional GPs. This has gone from a practice that was at risk of closure to a practice that is now providing Medicare urgent care and also expanding bulk-billing to that local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These clinics are a major vote of confidence in regional primary care. They are encouraging doctors into the regions. I was at a regional Medicare urgent care clinic, and the doctor working there was from Maroubra in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. I was at one in Queensland, and the doctor working there was a GP from the Gold Coast. We are now getting GPs into the regions as part of strengthening Medicare through these urgent care clinics. They are giving more Australians access to high-quality, free health care in places where it otherwise hasn't been available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many more initiatives in the budget which go directly to supporting and growing the health workforce in regional and rural Australia. There is $90 million to fund the implementation of the independent review of Australia's regulatory settings relating to overseas practitioners, also known as the Kruk review; $17.4 million to support health services at risk of closing; primary health networks and rural workforce agencies working with rural communities to support people to get the care they need closer to home affordably; $74.8 million to support the Royal Flying Doctor Service, which will continue to allow the RFDS to provide its primary care and dental services to more Australians across rural and remote communities; and an expansion of the range of free mental health services so Australians get the right level of care for their level of distress, including for those living in regional, rural and remote Australia. Perhaps most importantly, there are incentives to fund more training and development of regional doctors in regional locations. There is $24.6 million to Charles Darwin University to establish a medical school in the Northern Territory from 2026. There is $4.7 million for the existing Northern Territory medical training program. There is $4 million for the Australian Indigenous Doctors Association. The single employer model trials will be extended until 31 December 2028 to help attract and retain GPs in the workforce where we need them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, in the education portfolio, there are prac payments for nursing, midwifery and social work students. I was at Gosford Hospital with the Prime Minister, and we saw nursing students talking about the life-changing difference it will make. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="C2T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:29</span>):  The minister paints a rosy picture, but I don't buy it, and I don't think many Australians would buy it. When I go about my work in my community and travel around Tasmania, including in regional, rural and remote Tasmania, and when I talk to my wife and her colleagues—and my wife is a general practitioner—it is patently obvious that general practice in this country is in crisis. It is an undeniable fact that many Australians simply can't find a GP with open books—or, at least, one that might bulk-bill. It's an undeniable fact that hospital emergency departments are heavily populated with non-emergency patients. It's an undeniable fact that many Australians are financially stretched to breaking point right now, and the big and growing gap fees are just one more pressure on those family budgets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania is particularly badly affected, as reflected in the shocking statistic that regional Tasmania has approximately one-third less general practitioners per thousand people in the population than the national average. General practice is in crisis. To be fair to the minister and to be fair to the government, there have been some positive reforms. Yes, the urgent care clinics are of some value—in particular in the cities, where they tend to be located. And, yes, I acknowledge that the tripling of the bulk-billing incentive payment has led to an uptick in the rate of bulk-billing. But, again, it is undeniable that bulk-billing rates are still woeful right across the country and that GP numbers are still grossly inadequate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government would dispute that—in fact, as I said, the minister has just painted a very rosy picture of it. But, even by the government's own numbers, the bulk-billing rate is still just 72 per cent in Tasmania, and that apparently reasonable rate—although I think it's still very low for a country as rich as ours—is actually covering up the reality. That's because when the government measures bulk-billing, it uses the number of bulked-billed services delivered and not the number of unique patient services. In other words, if a member of the public goes to see their GP and has to pay for the consultation, but gets a referral for a bulked-billed blood test and perhaps a bulked-billed x-ray, then the numbers the government uses would show those as three services, one not bulked-billed and two bulked-billed. In other words, the government's figures are grossly misleading. In fact, when I drill down into the figures and look at figures for Tasmania for the patients that are always bulked-billed across the state, it's only 36 per cent. That 36-per-cent figure was from before the introduction of the tripling of the bulk-billing incentive. But, even if we apply all of the uptick seen across the country as a result of the bulk-billing incentive payment, then the figure for patients who are always bulk-billed in Tasmania is still only a bit over 40 per cent. It's barely a bit over half of what the government claims in its figures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This can be fixed, starting with restoring the Medicare GP rebate to the value it was in 1984—when it was introduced. The fact of the matter is that due to pauses in indexation, and inadequate indexation since 1984, the real value of the Medicare GP rebate is about half what it was in 1984. This explains why doctors aren't bulk-billing; this explains why the number of unique patients in Tasmania that are always bulk-billed is just a bit over 40 per cent. It's because the rebate is so woeful that you can't run a GP practice and rely on it. That's why so many GPs are having to resort to a gap payment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can we afford this? Of course we can. The budget that was brought down two weeks ago forecast that the government would spend three-quarters of a trillion dollars next financial year. Heavens, it's all about priorities and working out other ways that we should be spending our money. And, very quickly, I would add that the other problem is the number of graduates. It's such an undesirable line of work now that only about 10½ per cent of medical undergraduates are considering following a career in general practice. Heavens, it used to be 70 to 80 per cent! So we have a crisis coming with the number of GPs: not enough now and certainly not enough in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This can be fixed. I call on the government to fix it; I call on the government to have a better set of priorities and to invest more money in general practice.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300126" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr REID</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:34</span>):  I just want to make the parliament acutely aware that these health issues—some of the health issues that we face today—do not happen overnight and they don't happen within a week. They happen over decades of neglect and they happen over decades of decay. I want to use my home electorate, the electorate of Robertson, as an example of this. I know that many in my community know this for a fact. The former Liberal member for Robertson, the current state Liberal member for Terrigal and the now Leader of the Opposition, who was the health minister, systematically, over a number of years, ripped the belly out of Medicare. And what happened? We had patients that couldn't afford to see a GP and couldn't get into primary healthcare services and, as a result, they ended up needing tertiary level care. They ended up needing an emergency department and needed higher levels of care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the Albanese Labor government is getting on with the job of improving health care for all Australians and making sure that we are restoring what is the beating heart of Medicare, and that is bulk-billing. I pay credit to the health executive here in the federal Labor government, Minister Mark Butler, Minister Wells and the two assistant ministers here in the chamber right now, Assistant Ministers Kearney and McBride, one a pharmacist and one a nurse, who know the importance of health care in this country. A healthy society means a healthy economy, which means a healthy industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the things that we are focusing on include tripling the bulk-billing incentive. On the Central Coast, that has meant over 10,000 additional bulk-billed visits to the GP. That means people are seeing their doctor for their primary care issues where they need to see them. Then there is the affordable medicines act, where medications have become cheaper for Australians. In my electorate of Robertson, that is over $2 million saved. We are talking about common medications that save lives. I have seen this policy actually working on the ground in the emergency department. I have seen patients who now have the ability to afford blood thinners that prevent them from having a stroke. They can afford that because of a Labor government policy. That is what we do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also talking about the stronger Medicare grants, upgrading the infrastructure in our general practices which for so long have felt the neglect of a Liberal-National coalition. We are talking upgrading basic infrastructure—things like phones and computers, things that they use for everyday clinical operations. That is something that has gone ahead. There is the PBS co-payment freeze, where pensioners and general patients will be able to save more and afford more medications that will stop chronic conditions from exacerbating and becoming acute medical conditions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is one of the hallmarks of our Strengthening Medicare policy, and that is our Urgent Care Network. We are creating a new model of care and a new medical speciality within Australia. That is what urgent care is. This is an exciting time for the medical space. If you are too sick for the GP but you are not sick enough to go to the emergency department, you go to one of these urgent care clinics. In my one alone we are talking nearly 5,000 presentations since it started. Those people would have otherwise gone to the emergency department for their urgent issues. These are not clinics where you just see a doctor or a nurse. In my clinic, there are also imaging services for x-ray and ultrasound. There are also pathology services, which can make sure that that patient can receive extended care at point-of-patient contact. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what you can expect from a federal Labor government when it comes to Medicare and when it comes to primary care and general practice. We actually put the effort in to ensure that people can see their GP and can get the care that they need when they need it—unlike what we saw in the previous decade, with the Liberal-National coalition ripping the guts out of Medicare and making sure that people couldn't get in to see their doctor and couldn't  afford their medications and then ended up in the hospital for serious medical conditions. Again, I commend the health executive and the Prime Minister for the work they have been doing in restoring bulk-billing and Medicare in this country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:39</span>):  I thank the member for Calare for raising this matter of public importance today. It is of critical importance, and I honestly believe there is not a person in the House who doesn't agree with him. For most of my professional career, before I came to this place, I worked in rural health care, and I want to acknowledge the healthcare professionals that sit on the benches of this House, right across the House—doctors, nurses, me as a midwife, pharmacists, paediatric neurologists and so it goes on. We are all incredibly familiar with the complex challenges that face our medical workforce and, in particular, our rural medical workforce. This problem of a shortage of rural doctors is not a new problem; it's one I've known about since I was a kid. It is right across the country, and it absolutely is affecting the communities I represent in Indi.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about a shortfall of doctors in regional Australia, we're talking about GPs in private and community clinics. We're talking about doctors in the wards of our hospitals. We're talking about surgeons and specialists. It's right across the board. We see it evidenced in the bills that rural hospitals are paying for locums to cover unfilled shifts. It would make your eyes water when you see those bills. We see it in the burn-out and, frankly, we see it in the despair of our rural doctors. It is heartbreaking. Post-COVID, rural and regional Australia has seen a net migration of around 11 per cent of people out of the cities and into the country and, quite frankly, they are shocked when they can't even get on a waitlist for a local GP. They can't believe that the books are closed. There is simply no more capacity. My office regularly hears from constituents who are deeply concerned by the long surgical waitlist—it makes the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Border Mail</span> on almost a weekly basis. It's not because these hospitals aren't trying their darndest. The health executives, the administrators and the staff specialists are doing their darndest, but they are under-resourced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to this government: as you are negotiating new health agreements with the states around increased funding for hospitals, call them to account on this. Hold them to account on putting that funding towards rural health, rural hospitals and places on the border like Albury-Wodonga Health, who I represent and who are absolutely struggling under the burden of the demand that's upon them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The postcode that one lives in should not determine the health care that one receives. It's so nice to say that but, frankly, it absolutely does in Australia. The rates of chronic disease are higher in rural areas, and the outcomes are worse than in metropolitan areas, and it is all about access. We have many unrealised opportunities to create a prosperous and thriving life in rural and regional Australia, but to achieve this we absolutely have to have top-quality health care and we have to be able to get an appointment with a GP or a specialist when we need it. We absolutely need to look at other models of care. Yes, we've heard about urgent care centres—great, if you've got one—but the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, the Rural Health Alliance and others put forward multiple solutions about how we can remedy this problem. A couple of things are: providing maternity care, and study leave for GPs in private practice. We need to think innovatively about how we support the medical professionals that we have to stay in regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hear many reasons junior and mid-career doctors choose to undertake their training and specialist care in major cities. Often, the specialist training on offer is more limited and the specialist colleges are reluctant to accredit rural training. There are fewer senior doctors on shift, and there's an expectation that junior doctors must work more independently in rural and regional hospitals than they otherwise would in the city, and it is impacting their mental health. We also need to support the family, the wives, the husbands and the partners of our rural doctors so that they, too, can find the jobs and the support that they need in rural and regional Australia. We need to invest in the public transport, better telecommunications and a fair share of housing investment if we want to train and retain our rural doctors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, we must nurture the talent that we have. The evidence we have is that rural students who go into healthcare professions stay and are retained in rural Australia in medicine, nursing and allied health. Fund things like the collaborative centre for research and training at Albury-Wodonga Health, which will bring in Defence, Charles Sturt University, La Trobe University, the University of New South Wales and our TAFEs. It will train and retain not just doctors but also our allied health and nursing professionals. I acknowledge the member for Cooper and the work she has done on the health team. We need a strong health team to support our rural doctors. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  I acknowledge the spirit in which the mover has brought forward this MPI, because I know that, since he got to this place, this has been an issue he has been passionate about. I know that because in my electorate of Bendigo, where we have the La Trobe Rural Health School, our university worked with his university to really champion the need for more medical places in our regional areas. That's because, as previous speakers have mentioned, when we train regional students in regional universities they stay and work in the regions. It's a fundamental fact and what all the data now shows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it's not as simple as creating more medical places. We need to do more. We need to interrogate the data and look at who is applying for medical places and their pathways to those medical places. One of our greatest challenges when it comes to recruiting people to medicine is the very high ATAR that's required. Our ATAR system is skewed towards elite inner-city schools. They do the best when it comes to ATARS. They're the schools whose students go into medicine—and not just medicine but other health professions. We need to have a broader conversation about who we are recruiting into our medical schools and where they're doing their medical placements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">La Trobe's Bendigo campus, in fact, has the largest rural health school in Australia. That may surprise people, because we don't actually have a medical school. What we do have is midwifery, nursing, dentistry, pharmacy and physio. We have all the allied services that go with it, and we continue to grow. When we are looking at solving the crisis in rural health care, we need to look at the teams of medical professionals who work in GP practices. The changes this government has put forward in terms of nurse practitioners, allowing and encouraging nurses to work to their full scope, are a measure that will help us solve some of the challenges we have in rural health care. The tripling of the bulk-billing incentive is critical to attracting and encouraging doctors to practise as GPs and remain GPs. In my electorate we've seen bulk-billing rates increase by 8.6 per cent. Through that one government measure alone, we are seeing more GPs bulk-billing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to our GPs, we need to have greater interrogation of the barriers to people going into general practice. A generation ago, about 50 per cent of medical graduates were going into general practice; today it's about 20 per cent and dropping. We need to interrogate that. When you ask these students why, they say: 'Well, I'm looking at the experience. I'm looking at how I can have that salary, how I can work in a team environment, when I have a university debt.' We need to look at better models of employment. Graduating as a doctor and then becoming a small-business owner running your own practice isn't attractive for every young person who goes into the medical profession. That is one area where we need to encourage and incentivise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my part of the world, what was known as a GP superclinic is today Bendigo Primary Care Centre. They are at a scale whereby they can start to employ young doctors and bring them in on a salary package. This is becoming very popular where we've got these bigger clinics in regional cities. They are currently running a priority care clinic, funded by the state government, which is taking pressure off the hospital system. Those GPs are able to practise a broader scope of medicine, something like what they might experience in a hospital setting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is where our hospitals are critical. I also say the states need to be part of this conversation. It is great that our state governments are building hospitals, but they are also sucking up a lot of our medical graduates. We need to get the states more involved in this conversation if we're to meet the demand not just for GPs but for doctors in our hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a complex issue, and I welcome the bipartisan way in which the discussion is happening—at least between the Independents, the crossbench and the government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HX4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  I spent my years in the state parliament carrying six doctors' names with me in my briefcase wherever I went. That's because we were constantly without doctors and I was constantly chasing doctors all over the world, mostly in England, to try and get them to come to our outback outposts—our mid-west towns, as we call them, and our towns in North Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To show you how greatly valued these people are, if you drive into Charleville, there is a big statue to Dr Ariotti—a very outstanding Christian man, I might add. I think that had a lot to do with his self-sacrificing nature. If you drive into Cloncurry, the highway is named after Father Dr David Harvey-Sutton, who was a priest in the Anglican Church. This is how important these people have been to our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I have had to face up to this problem. We called a meeting to get a medical school built. We called that meeting for eight years continuously. We got it eventually, thanks to an outstanding person of the Jewish faith who established the medical school. I'm very proud to say that my daughter, Mary-Jane Katter Streeton, got the credit, but I think that doctor, Professor Wronski—and she would agree—deserved most of that credit. We got the first medical school built in 44 years in Australia. Now there are something like 19 medical schools that have walked through the door that we have opened, and the situation is worse now than it was before those medical schools came in. I've heard two speakers tonight say that 70 per cent went into general practice, presumably a lot of them in regional areas, and now that figure is down to 10 or 20 per cent. Two speakers have referred to that. Therein lies the problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think there's any way out of this problem except to go back to what the much-maligned Bjelke-Petersen government had in place. I just look back and think, 'Were we really that good?' Yes, we were! If you became a medical graduate, you had to spend two years doing a practice wherever the government sent you. That was part of the deal. You could not practise as a doctor in Queensland without doing those two years. I think there's only one way to deal with this problem, and that is to go back to 1½ years compulsory at the direction of the government. You'll be sent wherever they send you. And, really, if you're sent to an outpost like Richmond or Julia Creek on your own, on shanks's pony, you've got to make the decisions yourself. I think that's important in the development of a GP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the answer of bringing people from overseas, I personally have had the rather unnerving experience of having pains in the chest. Three doctors from overseas looked at me at the hospital. It was a long time ago now. They said that there was nothing wrong with me and sent me home twice. The ambulance man just rushed me straight through to Townsville. He didn't worry about what the doctors said. I was having a massive heart attack, and three foreign doctors didn't pick it up! I was rushed into emergency surgery. So, for some of these doctors that have degrees from overseas, they are not degrees as we understand it here in Australia. Some of them, on the other hand, are very excellent. I pay great tribute to Mo Diqer, who did the operation and restored me to extremely good health. He was an outstanding man in every respect. He died recently in North Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the answer to the problems outlined by the speakers—and I think there have been very excellent contributions made by the speakers; I very rarely hear as good a contribution as I've heard tonight—will have to lie in a compulsory 1½ years. If you're going to get a job that's going to pay you half a million a year, surely you owe something to the people of Australia. No-one complained about the two years. I never got a single complaint in my years in the state parliament about the two years. In fact, I think most of them really enjoyed it. But we have to make the 1½ years compulsory. We have to do that, or the situation is going to get worse and worse, bad as it is.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:54</span>):  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Medical Journal of Australia</span>, in August 2023, published an editorial that described the shortage of doctors in remote, rural and regional Australian communities as 'a longstanding health policy challenge' many decades in the making, and that is very true. To create a generalist rural GP requires at least four to eight years of postgraduate study. For a rural specialist or subspecialist, it's five to 10 years or longer. So the timeframes for increasing our medical workforce are very long. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had coalition governments that, for 10 years, did nothing. In 2016, when I was first elected, I went to see Sussan Ley, the member for Farrer, now the deputy opposition leader, to express to her my concerns about the declining and ageing rural GP workforce. Nothing was done. When she was removed as health minister and replaced by Greg Hunt, I went to see Greg Hunt on several occasions to say that the rural GP workforce was worsening. I met with him, I think, on a second occasion about six months later, with members of the Department of Health, to say that the workforce modelling was very poor, that our rural GPs were declining in number and that this was becoming an increasing crisis—they were the words I used—for primary care in rural and regional places and also in outer metropolitan areas. Very little was done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to congratulate our health team, led by Mark Butler and also by the member for Dobell and the member for Cooper, for the incredible work they are doing to improve access to primary care through our rural workforce and for the things that they have done to increase the number of medical students wanting to go into general practice. I'm pleased to report that in 2022, the last year we have statistics for, there was actually an increase, although small, in the number of medical students wanting to go into general practice schemes. We know that medical students that are trained in rural areas are more likely than city medical students to stay in the bush. That's very important. It's the reason why the Albanese Labor government is doing all it can to improve access to rural GP training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of increasing investments in bulk-billing, we're investing $1.5 billion in an indexation boost to every single Medicare rebate. That increases the amount that doctors are receiving for every single Medicare service and makes it more likely that people will work, and more viable for people to work, in rural general practices. As we've heard, there is statistical evidence that bulk-billing is increasing in rural and regional areas as well as in metropolitan areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to this, our government is investing a further $2.2 billion in reforms to help strengthen other Medicare item numbers, including prolonged consultations, now and in the future. This includes payments for GPs to improve and grow their teams and to have case conferencing rebates, and it includes easier access to telehealth for many patients. It's very important, with issues like distance and transport difficulties, that telehealth is providing healthcare access to people who find it difficult to get into GP practices in rural and regional areas. Importantly, the Albanese government is really expanding that. There are practice incentives of up to $21,000 a year, with workforce incentives, to improve workforce participation in health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are problems in the bush not just in our GP workforce but in our nursing workforce and with specialist nurses such as diabetes educators. We've seen huge shortages in rural and regional areas. We're doing what we can to improve access to general practices for these rural health workers as well. There's also $4,000 to $10,000 a year for doctors to provide skilled services and speciality training for eligible doctors to provide emergency care through our emergency care centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is doing as much as it possibly can. After 10 years of coalition neglect, it's going to take a long time for us to turn the workforce issues around, but we are determined to do it, and we will do it. As a member for Clark has said, it can be done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  I want to start by acknowledging the record investment this government has made in the healthcare sector over the course of the last two years. It's welcome, and it's a strong indication that this government is both aware of and willing to engage in appropriate discussions that could potentially resuscitate our overstretched and flailing primary healthcare system. But today's MPI is not about that investment; it's about our system's inability to incentivise, retain and attract talented general practitioners, a challenge that faces so many communities across our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I welcome this MPI and the fact it calls out the challenges faced by regional and rural communities, the truth is that my seat of North Sydney is not exempt. Recently I found myself speaking to my own GP about her frustrations with what she perceived as a persistent trend at the federal level of undervaluing general practice as an expertise. As she argued, GPs train for as long and as hard as any medical speciality and yet an hour of their time is deemed to be only worth somewhere around $170, while an orthopaedic surgeon can charge upwards of $2,500 for the same period. With Medicare rates falling behind and in many instances now considered almost disrespectful, bulk-billing rates are falling rapidly right across our country, with a recent survey of my electorate showing that, of the 54 GP clinics, only eight bulk-bill. That's 14 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, just this week, the AMA released figures showing that one in 10 patients in New South Wales leave emergency departments without completing their treatment, due to waiting times. The median waiting time between arriving at and leaving the emergency department at the Royal North Shore Hospital in my electorate has risen to four hours and 40 minutes, an hour longer than the state average of three hours and 38 minutes. The government tells us we should look to urgent care clinics to bridge both the GP and emergency care gap, but there isn't an urgent care clinic in my electorate. So what is my community to do?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, I recognise the circumstance we find ourselves in is something that has taken decades to create. While we do feel it in the urban centres, I acknowledge the healthcare services of my youth in regional north-west New South Wales, where I grew up, are now actually unrecognisable. In the eighties, my hometown of Coonabarabran was a healthcare hub. We had several incredible GPs, including Dr Kerr and Dr Varley, who cared deeply for our community. They did it all, from delivering babies to setting broken bones. They stitched wounds and removed suspicious skin spots. They worked from both their rooms and a state-of-the-art regional hospital facility that was a centre of excellence for road trauma. We also had an incredible multi-vehicle ambulance service, which unfortunately my family actually had to rely on on several occasions.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast-forward to today and, now, despite having an incredible local doctor, Dr Iannuzzi, my parents often talk to me of being unable to secure a walk-in appointment anymore and of women now having to travel to either Dubbo or Tamworth to have their babies. For me, the demise of services became incredibly stark when my children and I came across a road accident on our way home not that long ago to visit my folks. The accident involved two cars. It happened seconds before we rounded the same corner. Having grown up out there, I knew what to do. I pulled off to the side of the road, called 000, set my hazards to flashing and went to help. What followed, though, was a complete shock in terms of how long it took the police to respond, the lack of resources the police had and, indeed, the fact that the ambulance never showed up because that ambulance was actually carrying someone who was drunk and disorderly to Dubbo. There is only one ambulance in town these days. Instead, I was tasked with carrying one of the people involved in the accident into town in the front seat of my car.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Herein lies the rub: in an environment where our cities cannot keep pace with the housing demand and where one option will surely have to be for us to explore the option to encourage people to move to rural and regional Australia, how can we possibly make that argument when we cannot guarantee those people access to services that we should all fundamentally expect? It is time we fix our primary healthcare system, that we begin to decentralise it again and that we empower communities in regional and rural areas to be the healthy, thriving places and spaces they once were. It is a choice that our federal government makes every year when it continues to fund urban centres for healthcare provision rather than looking beyond that to true regional and rural community hubs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Calare for bringing this really important matter of public importance to the House, and I encourage us to continue this debate until we find a reasonable solution.</span>

                  <a href="263547" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  The Albanese government is committed to improving the health outcomes of Australians living in regional, rural and remote areas. We on this side of the House recognise that, by strengthening Medicare, we can support more people across our regions to get the care they need and deserve. Our government's ongoing commitment to improving access to health care across Australia is reflected in our 2024-25 budget, which provides $2.8 billion to further strengthen Medicare. This is in addition to the historic $6.1 billion investment in Medicare in the 2023-24 budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These investments address the pressing challenges in our healthcare system. We recognise that, after a decade of coalition neglect of Medicare and our health system, it has become harder and more expensive to see a GP. The former Liberal government froze bulk-billing rates and decimated primary care, including in rural and remote areas. They ripped billions of dollars out of public hospitals, which has had a lasting and devastating impact on Australians living outside major cities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no secret that general practice was in its most parlous condition in the 40-year history of our system when we came to government. Under the Liberals it had never been harder or more expensive to see a doctor, and bulk-billing was in sharp decline. That's why our government acted swiftly with a historic investment in Medicare. The GP bulk-billing rate has risen by 3.9 percentage points in regional, remote and rural areas in the first five months since our government provided $3.5 billion to triple the bulk-billing incentive. The increase in the bulk-billing rate is achieving results with Australians in our regions, who are taking on an extra 550,000 trips to GP bulk-billed services since 1 November last year. For locals in my electorate of Corangamite, this has meant an additional 26,400 bulk-billed visits to the GP since November 2023.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this year's budget Australians living in the regions will benefit from a $213 million package that will deliver cheaper medicines, more access to scans and other tests, more Medicare urgent care clinics, more free mental health services and more investments in our health workforce, along with telehealth services in the regions. The measures in our budget include $17.4 million to support health services at risk of closing; $74.8 million to support the rural flying doctor service, which will continue to ensure primary care and dental services are accessible to more Australians across more remote communities; and expansion in free medical health services, ensuring Australians get the right level of care for their level of distress, including for those living in our regions. Importantly our government provided funds of more than $1.8 billion for programs that develop the workforce and support a more balanced distribution of health professionals in areas of need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2023-24 budget took the first steps in supporting our highly trained health workforce. This included a number of new incentives and additional payments to promote and secure more doctors in rural and remote communities. We are already seeing the benefits of this investment, with a significant increase in junior doctors starting as GP trainees in this year alone as well as an oversubscribed rural generalist training scheme to build our rural workforce. The extra GP training places will see more doctors living, working and training outside our major cities while providing care to people in our regions. Our government will continue to build on this progress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor governments have a proud history of investment in the health of all Australians. Our support for GPs in the regions and our ongoing investment in Medicare and bulk-billing build on this legacy and demonstrate the Albanese government's commitment to a stronger healthcare system for all Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  I thank the member for Calare for raising the issue of the urgent need for the government to immediately address the shortage of doctors in rural and regional Australia that is now a crisis, and the need to deliver better health services for all Australians regardless of their postcode. Too often in this place members seek to sow division between urban and regional communities. But the reality is that all members here and all communities care about all of Australia moving forward—in particular, my urban community of Warringah. I decided to get into politics very much because I was very concerned about the future our children face, so I will focus a little more on that aspect when I think of rural and regional health and the crisis it faces—in particular, because in Warringah we have the Royal Far West, which I believe is the only national charity focusing on delivering services to regional and rural children, which it has been doing since 1924. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As they state, the need is so great. While all parents want the best for their children, not all parents in Australia have the same access to resources to help their children with their health and development needs. There is a widening gap between the needs of country children and families and the health services available in rural and remote regions of Australia. The evidence is stark and indisputable: where you live matters. The rates and consequences of not addressing developmental vulnerabilities increase the further a child lives from a metropolitan centre, and can have impacts that last a lifetime. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the disadvantage and growing complexity: some 190,000 children across rural and remote Australia need development support. Children living in very remote areas of Australia are twice as likely as city children to start school developmentally vulnerable. Over 50 per cent of country children through our child family services have experienced trauma—that is from Royal Far West and their services. Sadly, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are twice as likely as non-Indigenous children to be developmentally vulnerable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Children's mental health: half of all lifetime mental health problems emerge in childhood, by the age of 14. One in five children in regional and remote Australia have a mental disorder. They have very limited access, with long waiting lists and long distances to travel to services, which exacerbates the problem. Seventy per cent of parents and carers in the children and family services within the Royal Far West report mental health concerns, and over 55 per cent of country children through the Royal Far West children and family service require psychiatry. Are they getting access to those services in regional Australia in other ways? The problem is that they are not. That is something for the government to address. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, only a few weeks ago we saw the government deliver the budget, and, while I acknowledge there has been progress and further development and there is a better focus on this issue, budgets are about priorities, and there is still a lot more work that can be done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know workforce and access to services is a major problem. We know nurses in very remote areas are a third of what they are in major cities when it comes to mental health services. There are 37 psychologists per 100,000 people in outer regions compared to 80 per 100,000 in cities. Over 80 per cent of people in remote and outer remote regions live in child-care deserts, compared to 30 per cent in major cities. There is one GP per 1,250 people in remote areas. So it's clear there is a huge difference and a huge distinction. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do so much more. So one of the things that were so frustrating when I saw the budget a few weeks ago was that, despite much, much advocacy to ministers and the government about the important service Royal Far West is doing in delivering many of these services—yes, through telehealth ways, but they are delivering them to rural and regional and remote children—there's no funding, so many services are due to finish. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those particular services that Royal Far West has delivered has been in relation to recovering from natural disasters. We know regional children are much more likely to be exposed to significant floods and bushfires. They have huge levels of stress as a result. This is going to have huge long-term impact on their development. That is something we should all be focused on. So for me it's incredibly important that those children are not left alone. We know that they are impacted to a huge extent, but we don't yet have the focus and the delivery of services they need. I urge the government to focus on this area. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr KATTER:</span>
                  </a>  There seems to be something lacking in our education system. There seems to be an unawareness of antisemitism. Must we remind people in our universities that over six million Jewish people were murdered simply because of their spiritual faith? It was unprecedented in human history, and it came out of antisemitism. Whatever the reasons were—whether it was something about banking and the Rothschilds or whatever the reasons were—the fact of the matter is there was rampant antisemitism. Some very great people were against the persecution, including Pastor Niemoller, who preached continuously against it;    the renowned and probably greatest economist in human history; and of course the German officer von Stauffenberg. If you read the history books, it just would have been so much better if they had been so much more aggressive so much sooner. Each of them sacrificed their lives, consciously, to try and stop the terrible things that were happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, if you attack and you unleash the dogs of war, don't come complaining back to me when you get bitten. Who would condemn what the Russians did in Berlin after what they had suffered under the German invasion? You'd do it? Then what will follow will be payback time. You went in, in an invasion of another country, and murdered 1,200 people. On what pretext? Oh, that they won't recognise Gaza? Well, Gaza doesn't recognise Israel, so how's that for an inconsistency? Absolutely outrageous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In any event, there is not a lot of precedent in human history for going into someone else's country and murdering over 3,000 people, as they did in the Twin Towers in the United States. There's not much precedent for going into a country and murdering 1,200 innocent civilians, and then putting it on television. I hate to say it, but some of their flags carry a sabre on them. And they say, 'We're just like you Christians.' No. Our flags carry a cross, a cross where someone was nailed and died for his faith, and what he said was: 'Love other people. Forgive your enemies.' And he was saying that while he was on the cross. Well, these people have on their flag a sabre. I don't condemn them for that, but I most certainly say: if you've read your history books, have the guts to stand up. If there is anything that distinguishes us Australians, it is our fight for the underdog and our sympathy with the underdog. Almost every single person that has ever come to this country came here because they were underdogs. Not surprisingly, our sympathy lies with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the ALP thinks that, by playing footsies and having a foot on each side of the barbed wire fence, they're going to proceed to, let us say, have children—that's probably a crude expression; I'll withdraw it. If you think that you can sit idly by and watch rampant antisemitism—I don't watch television very often, but I watched on the television, as I think so many other Australians did, in horror as something like 70 or 80 people were in front of the Opera House, chanting, 'Gas the Jews.' It's a crime in this country to advocate murder. That is a crime. Did the police do anything about it? I tell you what: if I'd been there, I know what the police would have done. They'd have taken me and put me in the clink, not the people yelling out, 'Gas the Jews.' They were not touched, not criticised, not condemned. There was no criticism of the police—nothing. On these days, some of us are ashamed to be Australians, ashamed that we Australians have elected to parliament people who have no backbone, no courage, no conviction. And people like that pay a terrible price. Ask the people of Germany.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you say that the Israelis should not be there, these Jewish people shouldn't be there, it's our country, hold on a minute. Where the hell do you think the Jewish faith came from? In 1365 Ibn Khaldun, the Arab historian, said he was very surprised that Jerusalem was predominantly Christian, as was the whole of Palestine. Well, where did all the Christians go? Where did all the Jewish people go? They were forced out or terrorised and murdered if they stayed in that country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are the Jews there today? Oh, we all know why the Jews are there today. It is because, when they tried to get out of Europe, the ship of shame went all over the world, carrying 200 or 300 Jewish refugees. England would not take them, Brazil would not take them, the United States would not take them and, to our eternal shame, Australia would not take them. We couldn't even take 200 or 300 of them? Where were they to go? So they decided to go back to the historical homeland, and who could blame them? What else could they do? As I said, they say, 'You don't recognise Gaza,' but they don't recognise Israel, so that's pretty poor. The fact is that there are a whole lot of Gazans living in Israel. Are there any complaints, uprisings or anything from them? No.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me put this in perspective. There is no term that can describe the behaviour of the Greens in this place except 'rampant antisemitism', and it is a provocation of the ALP to try to win seats off the Labor Party on the basis of racial or religious persecution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have a lot of people of the Jewish faith in North Queensland, but those we do have are pretty outstanding. Cairns was a grubby, greasy little backwater that nobody would go to if you paid them—until four wonderful families came along. I won't go into the other three, but I will mention the Kamsler family, who built the first five-star hotel in Cairns. Their wonderful foresight enabled us to establish a world-class international tourist destination, which is now Cairns. One of the four families that created that wonderful occurrence was the Kamsler family, and I pay them very great tribute. The boys' parents were Holocaust survivors and, if there are nicer people on the planet than the Kamslers, I've never met them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They were the first hotel in Cairns to employ First Australians. Mickey Miller, the great blackfella leader I'm very proud to have looked up to all of my life asked me to stay there because it was the only hotel in Cairns that would employ First Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were just talking about lack of doctors. The first medical school built in Australia in 44 years was the result of Professor Ian Wronski, who is very proudly a person of the Jewish faith. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  The date of 7 October 2023 will go down in history as being one of the darkest days of this century, a day when 1,200 innocent Israelis were killed when more than 3,000 Hamas terrorists invaded Israel in 30 locations in what could be described as nothing other than a military-style operation. They crashed through fences, they dug under fences, they flew over fences and they stormed kibbutzim, towns and villages on the borders. As I said, 1,200 Israelis, men, women and children—not just Jews, but Israelis—were killed in those attacks, and more than 250 hostages were taken on that day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my capacity as the deputy chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I was shown that 42-minute video of body cams of Hamas terrorists. In those 42 minutes, we watched the slaughter of over 100 innocent Israelis. Those body cams were kept on the Hamas terrorists because they wanted all of us—they wanted you and me—to watch it. They wanted to strike fear in the heart of every person in the Western world. The attack that occurred in Israel was not just an attack on Israel; it was an attack on the world, and when countries and political parties stay silent they are complicit in that behaviour. A couple of days after I watched that video, I travelled to Israel and went to the kibbutzim. I went to towns like Sderot and saw the after-effects. I walked into the homes where people had been slaughtered, where hand grenades had been lobbed through windows and where buildings had been blown up with rocket propelled grenades. Be in no doubt: there is no moral equivalency between Israel's right to defend itself and what Hamas did on 7 October. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Greens to try to move a motion today which would effectively reward Hamas for its atrocities is a stain on that party. It is a stain on their members who are members in this House and the other house. The member for Berowra put it so well when he spoke eloquently this morning: if anybody is thinking of voting Greens at the next federal, state or local government elections, I want you to think you about this day, about 7 October, and remember that it is Israel's right to defend itself. Think about what we would do as a nation if another country did that to us. The Australian people would be looking for the Australian government to defend Australian people—and that is what Israel is doing for its people. Men and women of Australia, when you are thinking about where to put your ballots or your preferences, remember the Australian Greens. I also want to call out the Australian Labor Party, because if the Labor Party think that they should be able to take their preferences at the next election, they should be having a very long, hard look in the mirror.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  This is not the first time I have spoken in this chamber on a suspension motion on this issue from the Greens in the morning and from the member for Kennedy in the afternoon. As I said this morning, motions of this kind are procedural motions that, members know, are always opposed by the government. They are motions to suspend government business in the House. The opposition to these motions should not be mischaracterised as any reflection on the content of these motions. These are votes that are made on the procedural reorganisation of the business, which is the substance of this motion. But today in the parliament, as we have seen in previous days, we have seen multiple crossbenchers seeking to make foreign policy via procedural motions in this parliament. That is not the way we make foreign policy in this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the appalling terrorist attacks of 7 October, the Albanese government has taken a consistent, principled approach—an approach grounded in bringing Australians together in challenging times, an approach grounded in the leadership that this country needs. We have consistently condemned Hamas's appalling terrorist attacks on 7 October. We have condemned the murder of 1,200 people, the use of sexual violence on that day and the taking of hostages, which continues to this day. We have consistently called for the release of hostages and will continue to do so until they are released. We've said that Israel had a right of self-defence in the face of this attack by Hamas but, equally, the way that it exercises that right matters. It matters that all parties comply with international humanitarian law in this conflict. We have made the point that Israel must comply with the ICJ's interim decision demanding humanitarian access and the provision of humanitarian supplies necessary for the sustainment of life in Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also repeatedly condemned the growing antisemitism we have seen unleashed by this conflict, as we have condemned the growing Islamophobia we are seeing. The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and my friend the member for Macnamara have clearly and publicly stood with Jewish communities and faith leaders in the face of antisemitic attacks and vandalism of faith based schools and places of worship. Just this weekend, the Deputy Prime Minister and the member for Macnamara were at Mount Scopus Memorial College, where they stood in solidarity with that community, who were victims of an appalling antisemitic vandalism attack. The member for Macnamara is a former student of Mount Scopus Memorial College, and he said that he was devastated by this act and that it has no place in Australian society—vilification and targeting of a school. The Deputy Prime Minister, who attended with the member for Macnamara, said that it was an appalling act of antisemitism, that it's an issue for the entire nation and that it's absolutely crucial that Jewish and non-Jewish Australians alike are standing up against antisemitism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what we have done and that is why the Prime Minister moved the resolution of this parliament, supported by nearly all MPs, on 16 October 2023. It's a resolution whose principles have remained relevant throughout the horrible months of conflict that have followed. It was a resolution designed to unite this parliament in a common voice. It condemned antisemitism. It recognised that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people, nor their legitimate needs and aspirations, and unequivocally condemned the attacks on Israel by Hamas. It condemned all forms of hate speech and violent extremist activity, including antisemitism and Islamophobia. It recognised that an attack on any religion is an attack on all religions, and that we all share a responsibility to unite, condemn and defeat such an attack on our common values and our way of life. It noted that undermining social cohesion and unity by stoking fear and division risks Australia's domestic security, and it affirmed in the strongest possible terms that hateful prejudice has no place in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nearly all members of parliament were able to endorse this because it's a unifying statement, a statement of leadership whose principles have remained relevant throughout this conflict. This is what we need to resolve this conflict: peace-building. The only way that we can end this cycle of violence is through a two-state solution, with Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in peace and security within their own states. That takes peacebuilding between the parties. It won't be achieved through procedural motions on the other side of the world in this chamber.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

When we look back through history, we see events throughout time that define the following decades and centuries, creating lasting effects till this day. We often see these events as single defining moments, but that's almost never the case. When Alexander Fleming first published his findings on penicillin, it went largely unnoticed until ten years later and took several more years of delays until its widespread use eventually began saving millions of lives and revolutionising medicine. When we think of the moon landings, we see Neil Armstrong taking his first step on the moon on 20 July 1969, but it began years and years before that, built on the successes and failures of millions of individuals worldwide and hundreds of projects. And, if we go back to the Industrial Revolution, it was a process which spanned generations. A recent estimate suggests it actually started almost 100 years earlier than thought, not in the 1760s but in the 1600s. Millions of people shifted their livelihoods, the fundamental industries that power economies changed and societies fundamentally changed forever. When we look at these events, we appreciate how pivotal they were for humanity, defining us and reshaping what humanity's future will look like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia and the rest of the world are once again facing a pivotal moment, a moment which will be looked back on in a similar way to how we look back on the Industrial Revolution. The transition to a net zero economy is the most significant challenge humanity has faced. There's no denying or doubting how monumental and necessary it is. Every day we not only hear about but see and feel the impacts of climate change. Our weather is becoming more extreme, our reefs are facing unprecedented coral bleaching, and we are losing an extraordinary number of unique flora and fauna. There is no denying that this is a result of our actions both historically and today, which means we have the responsibility not only to ourselves but to future generations to mitigate the effects of climate change and build a future which will be liveable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to power in 2022, the Albanese government has dramatically shifted and expanded Australia's climate action. The previous government not only delayed action but actively struggled to believe in the facts of climate change, an issue that still plagues them in opposition, with their economically illiterate and irrational pursuit of nuclear power. The Albanese government lifted and legislated our emissions reduction targets, passed changes to the safeguard mechanism, introduced and expanded the Capacity Investment Scheme and set a target of 82 per cent renewables in the NEM, amongst many other changes since 2022. After a wasted decade, we are acting. And, because of the wasted decade under those opposite, all levels of government are faced with the difficult task of transitioning our economy and power grid swiftly whilst the coal power stations still operate. The exit that those opposite refused to plan for, despite being warned for years, is now imminent, and the Albanese government has not been sitting on its hands. Australia is a fossil-fuel-based economy, and we must not be left behind as the world transitions away from fossil fuels. Australia must benefit from decarbonisation, and there are significant opportunities for us as a nation to leverage our advantages to become a renewable energy superpower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is blessed with an abundance of renewable energy sources, critical minerals deposits and the knowledge to benefit from them. However, the Albanese government recognise that, for a fossil-fuel-based economy, the industries, communities and workers will be impacted by this transition, much like the displacement of previous shifts in the world's economy—whether from the industrial revolution or globalisation. This is why this legislation is critical, as it establishes a permanent Net Zero Economy Authority. It is not only another stepping stone in our path towards net zero but it will ensure that our communities, especially in regional Australia, are not left behind. It's one of those measures that will define our response to the climate crisis, especially when examined by future generations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Announced in May 2023, the Albanese government has moved to establish the interim Net Zero Economy Authority, and today the bill before the House details functions, powers and government arrangements, as well as a transition for the current interim body to an independent statutory authority. This authority has been subject to significant consultation and feedback from across society, with investor groups, business bodies, unions, peak energy bodies and local community groups across Australia participating. As a result of the extensive consultations, this authority has received support from 16 peak bodies, including the ACTU, the Australian Energy Council, the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors and the National Farmers Federation, because they all recognise the importance of a just and orderly transition to net zero. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority will play an important role in coordinating the government's policies and help facilitate public and private sector participation and investment across the country. It will support those workers in industries that are emissions intensive and will be affected by the transition with access to new employment and upskilling opportunities, and it will help improve their employment prospects. It will also support the implementation of the Energy Industry Jobs Plan, which will create a consistent approach in supporting workers to transfer from coal- and gas-powered stations and dependent coal mines to new employment. The authority will work with Indigenous communities so they, too, can benefit from transition to net zero. In exercising its functions, it will prioritise those communities, regions, industries and workers most impacted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the authority will be governed by an independent board of up to eight members, and a chair to be appointed by the minister. The board's composition must also consist of two members with experience in the union movement, to ensure that the views and concerns of workers are considered. Two members must also have experience in business, industry, finance or investment. Other members should have experience in economics, decarbonisation pathways, climate change policy, energy markets, regional development, First Nations engagement, public or cooperative governance, or law. The diversity of experience on the board will ensure its advice and decisions are made in the best interests of everyone, and will deliver Australia's goal of reaching net zero. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Authority will play a fundamental and critical role in Australia's transition to net zero, alongside the almost $40 billion in government incentives to reduce emissions—incentives such as the $20 billion Rewiring the Nation Fund, the $1.9 billion Powering the Regions Fund, the $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program and the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No single program or initiative will solve the complex task of transitioning our economy. Much like every other significant moment in humanity's history, it will take the efforts and contributions of millions of people working across projects both small and large and spanning decades. The transition is one of humanity's most significant challenges, and this government is committing to ensuring that all Australians are brought along and will benefit from it. This is the purpose of this authority. I commend the bill to the House. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  The Net Zero Economy Authority will be a new statutory authority tasked with promoting an orderly and positive economic transformation as the world decarbonises. Ninety-seven per cent of the countries that we export to have already committed to net zero. The scale and the significance of this global transformation will be huge for a country like ours, which has relied for decades on emissions-intensive industries as the bedrock of our economic success. For Australia, the transition is a singular and extraordinary economic opportunity—a chance to lead the world in production of cheap, clean energy and to take back control of our mineral and rare earth dependent industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want that opportunity, if we recognise it for its unique circumstances, then we have to be prepared to invest in it. The establishment of this authority as the coordinating national body is a solid and welcome step. Unsurprisingly, the previous government lacked the vision for this commitment. The current government is acting appropriately, but it could go much further. The authority will coordinate the net zero transformation in three main ways: firstly, by facilitating achievement of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets; secondly, by assisting our transformation to becoming a renewable energy superpower; and, thirdly, by supporting our Australian regions and workers through and beyond that economic transformation. Today I shall focus my remarks on the first two objectives of the authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has committed internationally and domestically to lowering our greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Those international obligations arose when we signed the Paris Agreement, along with over 150 other nations. As a nation, with the passage of the Climate Change Act in 2022 we further committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to 43 per cent below 2005 levels and to net zero by 2050 in our domestic law. The effort and the commitment required for us to achieve these reductions is enormous. As the Minister for Climate Change and Energy has said, holding the world to 1.5 degrees of warming will be very, very difficult to achieve. And yet, in spite of that, this government recently announced its Future Gas Strategy, which includes the ramp-up of gas extraction and the use of gas until 2050 and beyond. The strategy proposes the use of gas as a 'transition' fuel because it displaces coal in the energy mix and because burning gas produces fewer emissions than coal. But the government's gas strategy goes much further than delineating a diminishing need for gas and a mature plan for the rollout of large-scale renewables over the next 10 to 15 years. It also includes the release of new offshore acreage for greenhouse gas storage and for new transboundary carbon capture and storage programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this policy, the government has put us into a policy landscape of reverse thinking and backward logic. As my kids used to say, it feels like 'opposite day'. We can ramp up our gas exports at the cost of domestic power prices, and of local manufacturing, while we're claiming to decrease our carbon emissions. Yep—that's opposite day. We're still putting more than $14 billion a year into subsidising fossil fuel use and subsidies in this country. And in the recent budget, the government committed $566 million in funding for Geoscience Australia to conduct mapping of mineral and gas deposits across the country and its territorial waters. It will provide that data for free to gas companies, and yet the Prime Minister has claimed that no government money will be given to gas companies through the Future Gas Strategy. Yep—opposite day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian industries used to enjoy abundant, cheap gas, and that gave them a comparative advantage. But successive Australian governments have greenlit massive gas exports without instituting a domestic gas reservation policy, so we sell our gas cheaply overseas while we pay more for it here. It's multinationals, not Australians, who reap the superprofits from those gas exports. We pay too much for electricity and we're paying too much for our own gas after it gets processed overseas and shipped back home. We export 82 per cent of our gas, but this government's Future Gas Strategy says that we need to build new import terminals. It's opposite day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Woodside's planned Burrup Hub expansion will be the largest fossil fuel development in the Southern Hemisphere. It alone would emit more greenhouse gas emissions than the output of all of Australia's existing coal-fired power stations. You don't increase emissions to decrease emissions. The same goes for carbon capture and storage. The success of this technology to date has been limited to its success in providing a convenient cover for fossil fuel industries. Take Chevron's recently approved Gorgon LNG stage 2 expansion. It will release three billion tonnes of carbon emissions over the next five decades. In contrast, its carbon capture and storage program has sequestered just over nine million tonnes to date and will capture only 100 million tonnes over the life of the system. The government has provided millions of dollars to provide regulatory and administrative certainty for offshore carbon capture and storage programs, but it says that it's not supporting gas developments. It's opposite day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second role of the Net Zero Economy Authority is to facilitate Australia's transformation as a renewable energy superpower. By putting billions of dollars towards critical minerals and green hydrogen in its Future Made in Australia strategy, the federal government shows that it is getting serious about a clean energy future. That is great. But I believe that it has missed a big, possibly the biggest, piece of the puzzle. Alongside critical minerals and green industry, the government must support home electrification via solar, home batteries and heat pumps. More domestic carbon emissions are created in our homes and from our cars—40 per cent in total—than from all of our businesses and their operations—30 per cent. Millions of households in this country have already saved on their power bills. They've cut emissions by electrifying parts of their home life. The electricity sector has achieved a 26 per cent drop in emissions in the last 15 years, while other sectors have remained largely static. Rooftop solar contributed 11 per cent of total supply in the national electricity market last year That is more than twice the electricity generated from gas. Those solar panels on our homes deliver electricity at a cost of 3c to 6c per kilowatt hour, a small fraction of the 30c per kilowatt hour that we pay when we get that electricity from the grid. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the world's cheapest renewable energy, and we could all share in lower electricity prices if the government's approach to Australia's clean energy future expanded to include our homes and cars more aggressively. We should be taking full advantage of solar power by maximising rooftop panel installation and increasing storage capacity in homes, so-called behind-the-meter storage. We can do that via cheaper home batteries, heat pumps and in electric vehicles. Only 12 per cent of homes which installed solar last year installed a battery too. They're expensive. While I welcome the $27.7 million that was allocated in the budget to integrate rooftop solar and household batteries into the grid, this is only a tiny fraction of the $22.7 billion allotted to Future Made in Australia in total. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Strong leadership is needed to give homeowners and small businesses support and certainty. The benefits are obvious. While the initial cost of purchasing solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles is high, they set those households up for a lifetime of savings: lower power bills as households generate their own electricity. This would be a much more durable and significant contribution than that $300 electricity bill rebate—less need for large-scale renewable generation, transition and storage, progress on which is much slower than the government would like. By 2050 the cumulative storage capacity in EVs in Australia will be four times the total energy storage requirement for the national electricity grid. By linking those EVs to the grid we could save the country tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure bills for batteries and other forms of large-scale energy storage. The government should help households stump up the capital that is required to help switch their appliances and vehicles, to help Australian households become domestic energy producers—a more reliable and resilient electricity network with distributed storage capacity in every suburb, ideally in every home. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For this to work, though, the government is going have to get the energy market governance right as well. Recently the biggest electricity distributor on the east coast, Ausgrid, announced plans to charge solar panel owners who export power to the grid during off-peak daytime hours. Other energy distribution businesses are considering similar pricing frameworks. These policies penalise householders and homeowners who have solar panels but have not been able to afford a home battery. The Australian Energy Regulator has said that our electricity network is not designed for large amounts of energy flowing back into the network. It should be. Ausgrid spends less than one per cent of its revenue on supporting rooftop solar. It and other electricity providers could do a whole lot more to ensure that the grid can accommodate 10 million electrified households.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We seriously and desperately need a review of energy market governance. It has to ensure that the appropriate technical standards are in place. It can be done, and it can be done relatively cheaply. These technical standards should be governed via a dedicated distributed energy resources authority—something like the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the way that it regulates medicines. I ask the government: aren't we better off giving low-cost loans or rebates on power bills to incentivise battery purchases or, even better, getting more Australians into EVs with bidirectional charging capacity than we are charging homeowners for putting electricity back into the grid?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Setting up the right regulations and governance structure will give confidence to the market that electrified households are central to Australia's net zero plan. Household electrification should be regarded as a national investment in important public infrastructure—as important as health or defence. This is something that the Net Zero Economy Authority needs to grapple with urgently. It should be part of our greenhouse gas emission reduction process and our transition to becoming a renewable green energy superpower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equity is important here. It's very important that every Australian household should have the same opportunity. It should be particularly important to the government that we make sure that these opportunities are available to renters, to people who live in smaller homes and to people who are otherwise economically disadvantaged. The government has to get the regulations right. It has to give households and small businesses help in their need to access cheap electricity. A battery here and a heat pump there might not sound as visionary as transforming big industry, but they could in the end be much more important in helping Australians make that net zero transition and in helping Australians reap the benefits of this new economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of inaction is too great, both for the climate and for Australians struggling in a cost-of-living crisis. So I do hope that this authority can achieve its aims, and I'm very supportive of it, but at the moment it feels like, as a country, we're making lots of commitments and we're foreshadowing plans but without really firm timelines and without detailed commitments to change. As a country, we do know what we need to do, but we seem to be held back, whether that is by lack of vision or lack of commitment or by factional interests or debts to vested interests. We have a single shot at getting to net zero. We owe the next generation nothing less. We just need the political will and the courage to actually do that. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  Establishing the Net Zero Economy Authority shows our government's strong commitment to ensuring that we do, in fact, transition to a net zero economy. As the world works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we must handle this change with careful planning and a clear vision. The Net Zero Economy Authority will be crucial to managing this transition. Its main goal will be to work alongside workers, industries and regional communities as our nation shifts from relying on fossil fuels to embracing renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change is not only about meeting environmental goals; it's about securing Australia's economic future, creating new jobs and building sustainable industries that will give Australia a global competitive advantage. We are fortunate to have a unique advantage as the world transitions away from fossil fuels: we have the critical minerals needed to decarbonise the world, we have plenty of sun and land for solar farms, and we have some of the world's best conditions for onshore and offshore wind. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Liberals and Nationals, ours is a government that accepts and understands this reality. Ours is a government that will use these strengths to drive down emissions and to grow our local economy. We understand that we have the opportunity to become a global leader in renewable energy and that we have a competitive advantage to manufacture using cheap, emissions-free energy. Compare this understanding to that of those opposite. The Liberals are captured by climate denialists who oppose grid-scale solar projects, who ridicule battery storage, who ridicule electrification and who oppose wind farms and hydro. From them we have had over a decade of climate negligence, resulting in wasted time and wasted opportunities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government was elected with a mandate to take real action on climate change. Communities like mine are sick of governments wasting time and politicising climate action. Bennelong is sick of the climate wars initiated by the Greens, from the Left, and the Liberals, from the Right. They want consensus and they want action. The establishment of the Net Zero Economy Authority through the passage of this bill is taking the action that Australians elected this government to take.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Countries across the globe are making the shift towards net zero. Australia under Labor is part of this global movement. This government, unlike the former, acknowledges the necessity of reducing our emissions. We have pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, aligning ourselves with international efforts to reduce the impacts of climate change. Personally, I'd like to achieve that goal well before 2050 and I'll continue to work within the government to help achieve that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our 2030 and 2050 targets will require significant changes across all sectors of our economy, particularly in energy production, transportation and industry. As a nation whose economy has long relied heavily on fossil fuels, shifting to net zero presents challenges and opportunities. The potential implications for Australia are profound. Our fossil fuel based industries, including coal, oil and gas, have been major economic drivers and sources of employment. Transitioning away from these industries will have significant economic, employment and regional impacts. But if we fail to transition we know the catastrophic impacts we will face due to climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Climate Council, without significant emissions reductions Australia is likely to experience more frequent and intense extreme weather events, such as bushfires, floods and heatwaves. These events have already caused billions of dollars in damage and have devastated communities, and without meaningful climate action they'll get worse. Deloitte Access Economics warns that without adequate climate action Australia's GDP could be reduced by six per cent annually by 2070, amounting to $3.4 trillion in lost economic opportunities and 880,000 fewer jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are under no illusions here. The transition to net zero isn't going to be easy, but it must be done. It has been and will continue to be a complex and challenging path, but Labor understands it's a path we must tread. Transition is essential for our environment but also for our economic future. Our commitments to net zero mean that we are contributing to global climate efforts but also paving the way for a more resilient and sustainable Australian economy. We want to unlock our potential to be a renewable energy superpower, and to do that we need to bring communities, workers and industry along with us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot understate the potential Australia has with renewable energy. We have the critical minerals to decarbonise the world, we have the best solar conditions in the world and we have world-class onshore and offshore wind conditions as well. And we're getting there, Madam Deputy Speaker. According to the International Energy Agency, renewable electricity generation in Australia quadrupled in the 2000s, increasing from 17.6 terawatt hours to 70.3 terawatt hours. This remarkable growth has elevated the national share of renewables in electricity generation from eight per cent to nearly 30 per cent. And we learnt this year that we are on track to meet our 82 per cent renewable energy target by 2030 and meet our emissions reduction targets too. Furthermore, Australia leads the world in household solar photovoltaic installations, with one in three households having solar panels. This widespread adoption underscores our capacity to harness solar energy effectively. That's why we're investing $20 billion towards the Rewiring the Nation program and over a billion dollars to help households further electrify.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to renewable energy, Australia is rich in critical minerals required for net zero technologies. We are among the top global producers of lithium, cobalt and rare-earth elements, which are vital for batteries, electric vehicles and other clean energy technologies. We're capitalising on this opportunity with a $15 billion package to support the critical minerals industry and promote renewable hydrogen production.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just our government that understands Australia's potential to become a renewable energy superpower. Leading industry bodies and climate change organisations say we can do it too. The Climate Council emphasises the urgent need for Australia to capitalise on our resources, stating that our nation can lead the world in renewable energy production and innovation. Climate Council senior researcher Dr Carl Tidemann highlights:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Every step we take towards a grid powered by 100 percent renewable electricity is a step towards lower power bills for Australians, less harmful carbon pollution and more control over our own energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Energy Market Operator has outlined a comprehensive, integrated system plan that aims to transform our energy market into a low emissions grid. Greg Bourne, a former president of BP Australasia, underscores the feasibility of transitioning away from fossil fuels, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia needs to phase out fossil fuels as quickly as possible and replace them with clean and affordable renewables and storage. It's the quickest path to a cheaper, cleaner, safer, and more reliable electricity system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This transition is important and is happening, and the Net Zero Economy Authority, which this bill seeks to establish, is such an important addition to our strategy to manage the transition to net zero. The authority's primary task is to implement the Energy Industry Jobs Plan. This plan is designed to assist employees affected by the closure of coal- and gas-fired power stations. It includes jobs and skills matching, training, career planning and financial advice. By facilitating redeployment arrangements, the plan ensures that workers can smoothly transition into new employment opportunities within the clean energy sector while ensuring that no worker and no region is left behind as we move towards a net-zero future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Authority will also act as a catalyst for major project development and investment. It will facilitate public and private sector participation in emissions reduction and net-zero transformation projects across Australia. This will include working with established investment funds and coordinating policy and program design to ensure an orderly, positive and swift economic transition. The authority's responsibilities include mobilising public and private financing support, addressing infrastructure needs and navigating tricky regulatory processes to bring these megaprojects to fruition. By working in a genuine partnership with businesses, unions and communities, we aim to ensure that the transition to net zero is inclusive, equitable and beneficial for all stakeholders involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This authority is pivotal in ensuring this just transition away from a fossil fuel based economy to a renewable energy powerhouse. This support is especially crucial for regions like Gladstone, the Hunter Valley, Latrobe Valley, Upper Spencer Gulf and the Pilbara. These regions, historically dependent on fossil fuel industries, are poised to become the economic powerhouses of Australia's future net zero economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The closure of major industries profoundly impacts communities. It sees workers lose their jobs and families facing significant economic and emotional hardships. Economies are disrupted, services are put under strain and it can leave a long-lasting mark on these communities. We can look to the shutdown of the BHP Newcastle steelworks in Newcastle in 1999 to see these real impacts. These steelworks once employed over 11,000 people and were a cornerstone of the local economy. However, with global steel demand collapsing and the plant closing, it resulted in the retrenchment of 2,000 workers and 1,000 contractors. Many workers had spent their entire careers in this plant, and the sudden loss of employment left families in financial distress. The ripple effects extended beyond direct employees, affecting local businesses and services. The experience of Newcastle underscores the critical need for our government's structured support during these important and necessary transitions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the Net Zero Economy Authority will do. It will ensure that, as we transition to the new economy, we support communities like the Hunter and Newcastle, we support affected workers and communities and we provide them with opportunities in the new economy. It will ensure that communities and workers are prepared for the transition we need and that they have the opportunities to retrain and diversify, while ensuring that they avoid severe disruptions we've seen in the past. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has a comprehensive strategy to drive Australia towards its 2050 net zero target. The government has committed to a suite of initiatives aimed at reducing emissions whilst helping grow new industries and ensuring a just transition for all. The establishment of this authority through the passage of this bill is a critical step in a broader strategy designed to guide Australia towards a sustainable future. This authority is integral not only for managing the transition but for ensuring that our workers and our regions are well supported throughout. From emissions reduction targets to the safeguard mechanisms, our Rewiring the Nation program, the Powering the Regions Gund and our capacity investment schemes, by helping households electrify and by investing in green hydrogen, critical minerals and much more, Australia needs to know that we have a committed and holistic approach to achieving net zero emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our shift away from fossil fuels will stimulate economic growth, create sustainable jobs and foster innovation across multiple sectors. The Net Zero Economy Authority will play a crucial role in coordinating all of these efforts, ensuring that investments are strategically directed and that the benefits of the transition are widely shared. Our government is committed to taking decisive action on climate change while ensuring that no-one is left behind. The Net Zero Economy Authority embodies this commitment, providing necessary support for workers and communities affected by the shift. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is crucial. Without it, the transition will proceed and potentially leave behind support for those who need it the most. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300006" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHANEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  This bill sets up the Net Zero Economy Authority, outlines its functions and then gives it the ability to do some specific things. I'm going to talk about four topics here. They are: why the intent of this bill is so important, how the functions of the authority fit with the intent of the bill, an example of transformation being done well in Western Australia and what's missing in the authority's real powers under this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, on why the intent of this bill is important, the objects clause of this bill says it has three aims: to promote an orderly and positive transition to a decarbonised economy, to work towards our emissions reduction targets and to support workers and regions in the transition. I was elected because, in part, my community wanted to see more action on climate. Each of these three aims is essential if we want to see more action on climate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first aim is promoting an orderly and positive transition to a decarbonised economy. I'm fascinated by the research produced by the Investor Group on Climate Change, which says the cost of an orderly transition is about one to two per cent of global GDP, the cost of a disorderly transition is about five per cent of global GDP and the cost of doing nothing is about a 10 per cent reduction in global GDP due to the impacts of climate change. An orderly transition will save money and can make us more of a leader than a laggard. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't rely entirely on market forces to drive this transition, because we don't put a price on carbon. It's known as a negative externality in economics. We all pay for carbon pollution, but the producer of the pollution doesn't pay. Government is in the unique position to assist in the coordination and integration required across the economy and the community to transition to net zero. To diversify our economy away from mining and gas production and towards energy sources that are less damaging for the planet, we need to set up the right rules and frameworks to guide investment into low carbon industries and energy production. So the first purpose of driving an orderly transition is vital. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second purpose of the bill is to work towards our emissions reduction targets. The objects clause doesn't specify which targets, but I hope it's applied flexibly so that any target—which I hope will become more ambitious over time—will guide the authority's activities. As the Business Council of Australia points out, the scale, breadth and complexity of the transition mean that unnecessary delays in project implementation and deployment will be the difference between Australia meeting its nationally determined contributions between 2030 and 2050 in an orderly and positive way and Australia sacrificing energy security, energy affordability, international competitiveness and real wages growth over the longer term. We are not going to meet our targets without some careful coordination, and only government—or entities established by government for this purpose—can play this role. The third purpose is supporting workers and regions in transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We currently face our greatest economic challenge of this generation—shifting to a low-carbon economy—and, like with any larger transition, people will need to change jobs. When cars became affordable, there were huge shifts in our economy. Roads suddenly needed to be smooth. Horse-and-buggy drivers were out of jobs. No-one had the newly needed driving skills, and people could live further from their workplaces. So much changed. We didn't resist cars because they would put the horse-and-buggy drivers out of a job; we navigated the transformation. Similarly, here, old jobs will disappear and new jobs will emerge, and we'll need to provide training and support to help minimise the impact and maximise the benefit of this transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I want to talk about how the functions of the authority fit with the very necessary intent of the bill. The authority's functions include consulting and cooperating with persons, organisations and governments to support Australia's transition to a net zero emissions economy; facilitating public and private sector participation and investment in net zero transformation initiatives; supporting workers in emissions-intensive industries to access new employment or improve their employment prospects; and supporting and delivering educational and promotional initiatives about the transition. These functions are pretty broad, but they're also soft—consulting, cooperating and facilitating. The authority does have a more active function in supporting workers, and the bill goes into some detail about what that support looks like—I'll talk about this more in a bit—but most of the functions are soft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, there is an elephant in the room. I'm very interested to see what role the authority will play in relation to decisions made by government that are inconsistent with our path to decarbonisation. Getting off gas will be an essential part of how WA and the world decarbonise. A few weeks ago the government released its future gas strategy. Despite the fact that we know the world needs to use as little gas as possible for as short a time as possible, this future gas strategy reads like an expansion plan, not a transition plan. There's a jarring inconsistency between the future gas strategy and every other action the government is taking to decarbonise. Alan Kohler, as he so often does, applies a bit of commonsense and asks: what is the point of all the other work we are doing to reduce emissions when it's all undone by these huge gas projects?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what will the authority do when it sees these inconsistencies? I suppose it will consult, cooperate and facilitate. It's going to take a lot of consulting, cooperating and facilitating to work through the mixed signals we're sending on gas. Without stronger functions in relation to these long-term planning inconsistencies, the government will have to be accountable for these decisions and mixed signals. I hope that the authority is able to speak independently and freely to the government and to the public about the difficulties we're creating for ourselves and the impact gas expansion will have on our ability to play our part globally and hit our emissions reduction targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Next I want to talk about the WA context and a positive example of how transition can be supported. As many of you know, my home state of Western Australia is a key piece in the net zero puzzle. We cannot decarbonise without Western Australia, and Australia will not reach its net zero goal by 2050 without WA. We have a challenge ahead in getting off gas, as I've mentioned, but in WA we do have a great example of how this might be done—by looking at how WA is getting off coal by retiring the WA state-owned coal power stations in Collie, in our south-west, by 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Collie is home to 9,000 people and 1,250 jobs in the coalmining and coal-fired energy industry. In 2019 it was identified that, owing to the uptake in rooftop solar and renewables, Collie's power stations would close progressively between 2023 and 2029. This obviously had huge ramifications for the Collie economy and workforce. The WA state government has been working with Collie using the just transition framework, which focuses on supporting workers, industries and communities as the economy changes. An essential part of the Collie Just Transition Plan is deep and considered consultation with the community through working groups comprising employers, employees and state and local governments. It involves strategic investment in diversifying the local economy. For Collie, this means a more than $662 million transition package with a focus on encouraging tourism to the town. It also means investment in skills, training and career advice for those workers preparing for the next employment opportunity. This plan is ongoing, so it's impossible to label it as a success or failure until the coal-fired power plants are all shut down. But, in terms of community understanding and acceptance of the transition, Collie is tracking well. The Just Transition Working Group is crucial to the success of this plan, making sure that community, government, employees and employers are meeting in Collie regularly to make sure communication and education are prioritised. I think Collie is a great example of how government can have a positive impact by guiding big economic change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I want to talk about what's missing in the authority's real powers under this bill. The bill goes into a fair bit of detail in relation to how it can support workers in emissions-intensive industries to access new employment. The authority can enable workers to access new employment or other opportunities or to acquire skills to improve their employment prospects. I welcome the amendments the government has made in response to the Business Council of Australia's concerns. However, I have two concerns about the scope of the Energy Industries Jobs Plan, which supports workers just like the Collie Just Transition Plan does. The authority's role is only triggered by the closing of a gas- or coal-fired power station, and support is only available for workers in these closing power plants. No other emissions-intensive project, like a mine or other extractive project, is covered by this plan unless there's a power plant associated with the project. My first concern about the scope is that this limitation might expose some workers who are outside the definition but who still will be required to transition to new employment when emissions-heavy industry transitions. My second concern is that there's an argument to broaden the scope so that the authority also has oversight of new transformation areas, particularly those in new renewable energy zones, that will require massive upskilling and diversification. An effective authority should focus on coordinating targeted areas in Australia where there are opportunities to build alternative cleaner energy industries and economic diversification. There's a perfect opportunity for the authority to apply similar leadership to what it will in assisting coal towns' transition away from coal to assisting renewable-energy-zone towns to transition to new energy projects. For this reason I'll be supporting the member for Indi's amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The broader issue with what's missing goes back to my point about the Future Gas Strategy. Should the authority be able to call out the government on decisions that make it very difficult for Australia, or the world, to meet our emissions reduction targets? If the authority is not going to do it, who will? Who will point out that it's pointless reducing our emissions in so many other areas if the emissions we avoid are dwarfed by the new emissions from gas extraction and use? Who will point out that approving new exploration licences that won't be exploited for years sends signals to the gas industry that we're not serious about decarbonisation? Who will warn government of the stranded assets risk we face as our trading partners try their hardest to get off what we're selling them? Because climate is one of the biggest challenges we've ever faced, we don't have a legislative framework to make decisions that prioritise climate action, so we attempt to block massive gas projects by using the imperfect tools we have, such as environmental legislation focused on biodiversity. If the authority isn't going to be the voice of reason in our conflicting decisions about our future, who is?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I believe the Net Zero Economy Authority has the potential to make a positive difference to how Australia decarbonises, and I will be supporting it. But it would have a better chance of delivering on its lofty objects if it could support workers not only to transition out of a career but also into a new decarbonised industry. I will support the member for Indi's amendments on this topic. It would also have a better chance if it could support workers in all emissions-intensive industries and not just coal- or gas-fired power station closures, and, importantly, if it were required to give frank and fearless advice to the government—which includes challenging policies and approaches that are inconsistent with meeting our emissions targets, such as the Future Gas Strategy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  The shift to net zero is happening, and in Australia, along with the rest of the world, we're reducing greenhouse gas emissions so we reach net zero by the middle of the century. As a fossil fuel based economy, this is a big change. We see enormous opportunity in this change for jobs and for industry advantage. The Net Zero Economy Authority is to ensure that we're looking after Australia's workers and the regions as we transform from a fossil fuel based economy to a renewable energy superpower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an economic change, but it will have social impacts. The way we navigate the change is just as important as the destination. The authority, on behalf of government, will partner with industry and investors in getting big transformational projects happening, projects that decarbonise our industrial facilities, that build new industries and grow the future economic base for regions like the Hunter and, of course, my neighbour Lithgow. The authority will support workers in these communities where ageing power stations will be retired through the change, especially where the change may be significant. Working with employers, unions and others, it will ensure that we are making good use of a highly skilled workers that we need more of in this net zero economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Authority complements more than $40 billion in government initiatives to reduce emissions and turn us into a renewable energy superpower. They are things like our Rewiring the Nation program to modernise the electricity grid so it can get renewables from where they are generated to our homes; the Powering the Regions Fund, which will help existing industries decarbonise and support the new clean energy industries; the Critical Minerals Facility, to grow that critical minerals production sector that is so crucial as we go forward; the Hydrogen Headstart program, supporting development of large-scale renewable hydrogen projects; and of course the National Reconstruction Fund to diversify and transform our industries in this net zero economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all crucial steps, but you can't fully achieve net zero without workers. It's absolutely essential that we develop the clean energy workforce. The Albanese Labor government is investing $91 million over five years to help skill Australia's clean energy workforce. We announced that in the budget. That includes things like $50 million for a new capital and equipment investment fund for facility upgrades to expand clean energy training capacity across wind, solar, pumped hydro, grid battery storage, electricity networks and hydrogen, as well as key electrical and construction trades. Funding will be directed to facilities where lack of capacity is actually preventing people from entering apprenticeships. Regional, rural and remote communities experiencing workforce transitions will also be targeted. This ensures that the opportunities arising from the net zero transition are shared around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another of our initiatives—previous speakers have just talked about how important this workforce is—is $30 million to turbocharge the vocational education and training teacher, trainer and assessor workforce for clean energy. We need to make sure we have enough teachers to train that workforce. We will focus on making it easier for skilled professionals to move between working in industry and teaching at registered training organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we go through this transition we are also providing support for small and medium-sized businesses taking on clean energy construction and manufacturing apprentices as priority occupations for access to the group training organisation services, with up to $1,500 in annual reimbursements over the apprenticeship. These small to medium-sized organisations have a part to play.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular bill sits at the heart, but there is a suite of things that go with it as we move towards net zero. I've talked about the workforce, but what I really want to emphasise is the opportunities that this creates for young workers. The Net Zero Economy Authority will be looking at the workers who transition from the old energy-heavy and energy-intense industries into the new energy ones. But there are also opportunities for young workers. The expansion of our Energy Apprenticeship Program will provide apprentices with up to $10,000 to help with the cost-of-living pressures they face. The expansion of this program means more clean energy apprentices can be in training to support the transition to net zero from 1 June this year. Young people around Australia will be encouraged to take up clean energy opportunities, helping them secure jobs of the future and support this transformation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the people aspect—because none of it happens without the people—but then there are a whole lot of strategies that sit alongside this. In the past couple of weeks we launched the National Battery Strategy—again, one of the new areas where we know we can have an advantage. The National Battery Strategy is part of our Future Made in Australia plan and shores up our economic resilience and security. We know the global demand for batteries is going to quadruple by 2030 as the world transitions to net zero. The strategy maps a path for Australia to take advantage of this growth and to build a thriving battery industry. The strategy identifies four high-value strategic opportunities. One is around stationary storage. That is building the systems to firm renewable power generation in the grid and for communities, businesses and homes—the batteries that all look different but sit around our homes and bigger versions around our industries. We also have an opportunity to provide battery active materials to the world by upgrading raw minerals into processed battery components and to strengthen those supply chains. We can also leverage our world-leading know-how to build safer and more secure batteries that connect to the grid. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth opportunity we have is building batteries for our transport manufacturing industry, including heavy vehicle manufacturing. We are a pioneer of battery technology but, over many decades, we have sent our know-how offshore and lost the jobs that they create. We really need to move beyond that dip-and-ship economy and become what we can be—that is, a key player in the market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we think about this move to an economy that is net zero, one of the key considerations we have is around consumers and how they will be protected. We are helping Australians by pushing bills down as we shift into delivering clean, cheap and reliable renewables. That is why we are extending energy bill relief. The $3.5 billion to do that recognises that our economy has not shifted enough into renewables, which are of course the cheapest form of energy. We are also looking at $47 million over four years for energy reforms that put consumers first, including things that allow consumers to switch to a cheaper energy deal. We are unlocking greater savings from Australia's world-leading uptake of consumer energy resources, such as rooftop solar, batteries and electric vehicles, which could avoid $10 billion in network costs alone for consumers as they switch. We are investing in the Australian Energy Regulator to boost capacity and information for households on what their energy choices are, as well as reviewing electricity market laws to ensure consumers can be protected from misconduct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are some of the initiatives that sit alongside a bill that creates an authority to oversee so much of this transition. But at the heart of the Net Zero Economy Authority are people. The sooner we invest in integrating our consumer energy resources like our batteries and our solar into the grid, the faster we will see the benefits. I should mention that the new vehicle efficiency standard is also going to save Australians $95 billion at the bowser and reduce transport emissions. These are all really key parts in this transition to a net zero economy, a transition that is happening now. It's not one that is coming but one that we are already in the process of making happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to make one last point, and that is about the alternatives that have been brought up. When we look at this Net Zero Economy Authority, the one thing it won't be doing is looking at nuclear. The costings show us that nuclear is the most risky, most expensive option that we have. Instead, the Albanese government is getting on with the job, with record investments in renewables, batteries and large-scale storage and the most affordable options for Australians—clean, cheap, reliable, renewable energy to create a resilient system that Australians deserve.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  On Saturday, I was travelling north, and a friend rang me up. He employs about 90 people. No, he's not a big-business man; he's a medium-business man. He's not the kind of businessman those on the other side hang around with. He isn't Lindsay Fox or Twiggy Forrest. He only employs 90 people. But I'll tell you what: he does a pretty good job with those 90 people, and he provides a great service to Australia. He said: 'Why is it? Why do governments hate people like me? Why do they keep loading me up with extra rigmarole, with red tape and with things I've got to fill out to justify the things that I've always done right? What is it they've got against us?' I find myself here today rising to speak on yet another one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Authority is another quango. It's another semigovernment, at-arms-length body that will make life more difficult for those who create wealth in this country. These bodies are a way for governments to hide from their responsibility. If you want any proof of that, you only need to look at this chamber this week, where the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs has been hiding behind the Administrative Appeals Tribunal: 'It's not me! It's this body over here. It's this semi-independent body that we fund and I give the riding rules to. And they are only implementing the rules I told them to implement. How could it possibly be my fault?' That's what happens with these bodies. This is a conversation I've had with my wife many times. Why on earth do governments keep divorcing themselves from the responsibilities the people of Australia elected them to hold by forming new quasi-government bodies to get in the road?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider small business and the impositions this government has already put on them. Have a look at the IR legislation, the casual conversion, the paid domestic violence leave—I said at the time that I wasn't against paid domestic violence leave; I was against the fact that companies and employers had to pay for it—more power for the Fair Work Commission, the right to disconnect and increased union access. Of course, now we've got the proposal for eight weeks of half-paid leave, which will leave huge holes in the workforce. Then we have the safeguard mechanism. That's aimed at bigger business. This is about putting the pressure cooker on businesses over the next 30 years to get to zero emissions. Funny thing—that's what we're talking about at the moment. That is another stick already on the shelf belting businesses to say: 'This is what you have to do. If you can't meet these targets, then you're going to have to buy them off other people.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we've got the scope 3 emissions raising their ugly head. That will flow down to smaller and medium-sized businesses. For them to meet their obligations, they will have to start putting the squeeze on their tertiary customers. The very small businesses will then have to employ accountants to work out what it is they are emitting and how they can meet those targets for the next people up the food chain. Just as a point of interest, because we've been talking about immigration in this place a lot lately, there were 4,000 accountants brought into Australia last year. I'll tell you what, Mr Deputy Speaker. If all this stuff gets up, we'll need 40,000 for those small businesses to actually deal with what's coming down the pipeline at them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So now we're getting the National Zero Economy Authority. I'll read this from the government's notes. It's intended to be a 'shopfront for industry and investors'. It will seek to 'work with project proponents, state governments and others to get projects to investment decision'. The authority will mobilise public moneys through vehicles like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the National Reconstruction Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, hang on! Isn't that what the Clean Energy Finance Corporation already does? On their website, they say their job is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To facilitate increased flows of finance into the clean energy sector and to facilitate the achievement of Australia's greenhouse … targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just in case you were thinking: 'Well, at least they are targeting private investment,' I can tell you they are distributing $30 billion of taxpayers' hard-earned money to reach that objective, and now they've got the Net Zero Economy Authority, which is going to assist them to do exactly what they were created to do. That's a handy thing to do in meeting that national greenhouse target!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got ARENA. Their job's pretty much the same thing as well, except they've got $16.2 billion over 10 years. Here we are with another organisation that is shovelling taxpayer subsidy to support what we are told is the cheapest form of energy. It really does test the imagination. If it's the cheapest form of energy, why on earth does it need to keep having all this money shuffled in its direction?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before those over there start saying I'm a climate denier or whatever, I will say that I'm a great supporter of renewable energy. I'd love to get some of those wind farms on my property. They're worth about $15,000 or $20,000 a pop, and if I could host 10 or 20 of those—in fact, I've probably got enough room for a hundred of them, quite frankly—I'd be quite happy to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's worth remembering that those wind farms are being built on another subsidy again, and this is a hidden subsidy, one you can't see. This is a consumer subsidy. Consumers' retail bills are jacked up to pay the LRET and, now, the new government is also subsidising construction of new generation. The retail part of your bill is jacked up, but you can't read it—it's not in there—so, when you compare the wholesale prices at any given moment of the day with your prices, you can't work out why on earth there's such a mark-up. One of the reasons for the mark-up is the hidden subsidies that have been built into that program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In large, this new authority is just providing more red tape for Australia and duplicating jobs that are already being done by other government agencies. I just can't see how it contributes to national wealth or progress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been a student of the national grid since the closure of the Northern Power Station at Port Augusta was proposed over a decade ago. I don't know whether you or anyone else in the chamber has this but I have a pocket NEM on my phone. It allows me to chip in there at any time of the day and have a look at what wholesale prices are doing. I noticed only last week that there was a warning from AEMO saying the national grid—this is the eastern grid—was looking at the possibility of blackouts in coming summers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that one of the most fragile parts of the year is autumn. I've been watching that pocket NEM pretty closely and seen that there have been many days when the wind is virtually not contributing at all to the network. I was writing something the other night and I flicked open my phone and had a look at the NEM. I know that South Australia has 2,742 megawatts of installed capacity of renewables. We were consuming around 1,800 megawatts at the time, but the renewables were generating 56—that's 56 out of 1,800, or three per cent of the demand, or about 1½ per cent of their full capacity—because there was no wind, and it was dark.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know if you know about these meteorological things, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz, but if it's dark you don't get solar power. Now, that's not unusual. We're told that batteries will fix this, and we've had some big investments in batteries in South Australia. They were contributing five gigawatts. Do you know why they were contributing five megawatts? It was because it had been calm for days, and the batteries were exhausted. This is not unexpected. It is not irregular. It happens at this time of year quite regularly. So we were keeping our lights on in South Australia by importing another 554 megawatts over the border from Victoria. I thought: 'That's pretty good. Perhaps I'll have a look at Victoria.' Well, they had the same problem. They had a bit more breeze over there—they were getting nine per cent of their electricity from their renewables and, to be fair, another eight per cent from their hydro facilities. But of course they are existing, old-money facilities that can't be expanded, so I think you can discount them largely. So 77 per cent of their load was coming from coal and gas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It brings you to this question: what on earth are we going to do in the longer term about bridging this gap if we are to get to net zero by 2050? It's worth pointing out that in South Australia we lead the nation on renewables—71.5 per cent of our electricity over the last 12 months came from renewables. That's pretty impressive, I'd have to say. The next best is Victoria, with 36.8 per cent. So we're leading the race in South Australia, but it's not the only race we're winning. We're also winning the race to the highest average retail prices. According to Canstar Blue—and I'm told they are about the most reliable averager of these prices—we're paying 45.3c for a kilowatt hour in South Australia. The next highest is New South Wales, at 33.84c. For the record, Victoria is 30.42c. So South Australia has twice as much renewable energy as Victoria, per capita, and we pay 30 per cent more—for the cheapest form of energy in the world!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How on earth can this be? It takes a bit of getting your head around. But the answer lies in the fact that it's not available all the time, and the more you squeeze your reliable generators, your dispatchable generators, the baseload generators—they needn't be baseload; they could be gas peakers as well, but the more you squeeze them—and put them out of business because they can sell on fewer and fewer hours or days a year when they can make a profit, the more of them drop out, or you don't get reinvestment, and they wear out. The fact that you need them for fewer days a year only amplifies the fact that you need them ever more for the days of the year when you can't generate enough electricity out of the network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that Australia's power services can just go down and go black and we can have a blackout for a few days is just not entertainable in the modern world. We have to be much better than that. While those opposite will throw rocks at the proposal of nuclear energy—and that's all it is, a proposal—let's get the ban off talking about it. Let's get the ban off consideration. I'm not welded to nuclear. I think it's a good idea, and so do 16 other of the top 20 economies in the world. We are No. 13 on gross domestic product output in the world. There is one country above us, Germany, that does not have nuclear power. They decommissioned theirs three years ago. There are three countries below us that do not have nuclear power, and they're all building nuclear power. So we and Germany are the only ones that won't have nuclear power in five or 10 years time, or whenever it is that those three countries come online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, if it's not to be nuclear, what is it that is going to fill this gap that I can predict will happen pretty much in March, April and May every year because we are in that period of the year when it doesn't blow, and at night-time, surprisingly enough, the sun is not shining? What is it that's going to fill that gap? It's not going to be coal or gas, because no organisation in their right mind would build a new coal- or gas-fired power station in Australia while they've got a government that is completely hostile to them. These are long-time intergenerational, inter-decade investments. They need to have surety if they are to invest. The government underwrites new renewable energy, but the government is not prepared to underwrite new fossil fuel industry or new dispatchable industry that is not renewable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm open to anything that comes along technologically that can fill this gap. Batteries are part of it. The point I made when I was reading out those numbers is that, once you get enough calm days, your batteries haven't got any kick in them either. So it doesn't matter what it is; you need to build an alternative power system capable of standing on its own two legs for basically weeks at a time, with very little renewable energy flowing into it, to sustain the electrical grid of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm out of options. I just go, 'What the hell is it?' If it's not going to be gas, it's not going to be coal and it's not going to be nuclear, what is it? Whatever it is hasn't been invented yet. So I'm concerned so much energy is being focused on what seems to be a goal that has a set of barriers placed around it that make it unachievable. If we want to get to net zero by 2050—and that's what this whole new organisation is about—we've got to get the regulation of it so we can do so.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill establishes the Net Zero Economy Authority and outlines its key functions, powers and governance arrangements. The Net Zero Economy Authority will promote orderly and positive economic transformation as the world decarbonises. This bill is essential for Australia to embrace our potential as a renewable energy superpower—an opportunity that Australia cannot afford to miss. This new authority will be crucial to ensuring that hardworking Australians in industries such as coal- or gas-fired power stations aren't left behind in the transition and can use their skills in our new renewable industries.</span>

It is a huge task, and it's also a task that we must see through. There is no room for equivocation or delay. We must transition as quickly as possible, but we can't allow for anyone to be left behind. The government understands that workers in closing industries must be supported through the transition, and Australia is well placed for this task. Regions like Gladstone, the Hunter Valley, the Latrobe Valley and others have powered our nation for decades, and they will continue to do so. Our abundance of renewable energy sources and of every metal and critical mineral essential to net zero technologies can be found in these regions, so it's important that, when old industries close, the employees are empowered to work in the new industries taking their place. That's why this bill will also set up a legislative framework to enable the authority to establish pooled redeployment arrangements to support employees in closing coal and gas stations and dependent employers to transition directly to new jobs at receiving employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority will be required to undertake a community-of-interest process to identify closing, dependent and receiving employers when a coal- or gas-fired power station announces its closure. The Fair Work Commission will make a community-of-interest determination based on an application from the authority's CEO. There will be obligations on closing and dependent employers to facilitate participation of their employees in the redeployment plan and to provide access to advice and training. While participation by receiving employers would be entirely voluntary, the government will use financial and other incentives to attract the interest of receiving employers. Unions will also have standing to make submissions to the Fair Work Commission regarding the composition of the community of interest and will have an ongoing role of representing workers during the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong transition plan such as the one provided for in this bill is incredibly important. When I was a university student, I did my honours thesis on the closure of the Newcastle steelworks and how government, the community, unions and employers came together to ensure the smoothest possible transition of the closure of that iconic steelworks, which employed so many in that community. Many people had worked there their whole lives. For many, three generations of family had worked there. The importance of getting that right for those workers and their families, for the region and for our whole economy was critical. From that, there were many good examples of how this was done, including BHP's response, which was an exemplar of how to manage a closure. There was a significant lead time, and they offered people support in choosing a career path for them after working at the steelworks. They were supportive of a range of different options and were as open as they could be about what people might like to pursue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were also some important examples where they matched people's skills to needs in the economy and community. One really good example of that was that, after working in the steelworks, the employees had a high level of technological skill, and there was also at the time a shortage of technology teachers, so BHP supported employees who wanted to take up the option to study to become teachers while still working at the steelworks and then placed them in employment in the New South Wales education system. That's just one example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, the Newcastle economy transitioned well through that process to different industries that were there. It certainly shows that, when you put in the time to work together with the employees who are facing this who are really at the forefront of the transition—the ones who will be personally affected—it is so important that they are not left behind. We are transitioning to a sustainable net zero economy, which, as I've said, is the biggest change that our economy will ever have seen and one that we must get right, and that's why this bill is so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new authority, with its focus on managing economic change, complements the over $40 billion in government initiatives before the last budget to reduce emissions and become a renewable energy superpower. These investments include the $20 billion Rewiring the Nation program to modernise our electricity grid and to support a renewables based energy system, the $1.9 billion Powering the Regions Fund to support the decarbonisation of existing industries and the creation of new clean-energy industries, the $6 billion critical minerals facility to grow our critical minerals production sector, the $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program supporting development of large-scale renewable hydrogen projects and the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund to deliver and transform Australia's industry for a net zero economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, that's not it. In this year's budget, the Treasurer announced $1.7 billion for the Future Made in Australia innovation fund to unlock private capital across new industries such as green metals and low-carbon liquid fuels, $1.5 billion to build capability in solar and battery manufacturing and to strengthen supply chain resilience and $1.9 billion to recharge ARENA's core mission: commercialising and developing new renewable energy technologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill today builds on this proud record in just our first term. The Net Zero Economy Authority will be a partner on behalf of government with industry investors in getting big, transformational projects underway. They're projects that decarbonise industrial facilities, that build new industries and that grow the future economic base of our country and especially our regions. These are the projects that are powering our transition to a cleaner future. These are projects like the Royalla solar farm, in the ACT, which was opened in 2014 just a short drive from this place. At its time, it was the largest solar farm in the country and was key to helping us here in Canberra get to 100 per cent renewable energy. These are projects like the Star of the South offshore wind farm, 10 kilometres off the coast of Gippsland, which when built has the potential to supply up to 20 per cent of Victoria's electricity needs—20 per cent in just one project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, since coming to government, we've already approved 46 renewable energy projects, with another 130 in the pipeline. As a result of the Albanese government, we've seen a 25 per cent increase in renewable energy in the National Electricity Market. That's even more incredible when you consider the incredibly low base we were starting from after a decade of inaction from those opposite. The New Zero Economy Authority will supercharge this important work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Tuesday the Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy announced that the inaugural Chair of the Net Zero Economy Authority would be Dr Iain Ross. As the Prime Minister and Minister Bowen said, Dr Ross brings with him a wealth of experience and a deep understanding of labour markets and economics. Previously, he has served as the President of the Fair Work Commission and as a judge in the Supreme Court of Victoria. Dr Ross, on his appointment, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The task ahead is monumental, but I am confident that with our collective efforts, we can turn this challenge into an opportunity for Australia. We have the potential to not only achieve net zero emissions by 2050 but also to establish the nation as a leader in renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have full confidence that this new Net Zero Economy Authority will guide us, and Australian workers, through the biggest change to our economy since the Industrial Revolution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his speech in the second reading debate, the Prime Minister said, 'We want to create a new generation of economic growth and prosperity for this nation.' The reality is that the world is moving on and so are we. Nations representing 92 per cent of the global economy have signed up to the Paris Agreement commitment to net zero, and 97 per cent of our trading partners have. It's happening, and this government wants Australia to reap the benefits, not get left behind as those opposite would have it. That's why one of our first actions in government was to legislate our net zero target. It's why we've implemented the safeguard mechanism to spur the move to a cleaner future. It's why, just a few weeks ago, we legislated our new vehicle emissions standard to ensure that the cars Australians are driving are cleaner and cheaper to run. And it's why we've put so much work into rebuilding our international relationships after the disaster that was the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison climate denial diplomacy. Who could forget the empty room in Glasgow as former prime minister Morrison preached about technology, not taxes, and getting to net zero in the so-called Australian way? We are working hard to reset these relationships and our place on the world stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you change the government, you change the nation. The election of the Albanese Labor government in 2022 jump-started this country into climate action. We're on track to reach 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. This bill helps us to do that, and I commend it to the House.</span>

                    <a href="e5d" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOYCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  Mr Deputy Speaker, it's a cult, isn't it? Their whole approach to how they're doing this has gone from reasonable to cult-like. Like all cults, it's all smiles when you meet them but it's misery when you're inside. Like a cult, you can't argue with them. You're either a denier, if you don't agree with them, or you're a believer. 'Don't you believe? Are you going to deny?' It's absolutism. There is zero opportunity for you to question them, and then they always put at the end the imminent calamity, the end of the world. You've got to sit inside the vestibule, inside the cult, to save yourself and be part of the virtuous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also has a lack of meaningful disclosure and explanation of the finances. You never quite get to the bottom of who's making the money and where it's going. There's always a select group of people who do make the money, and they make a lot of it. And it's in their interests not to let people see the darker side of how the cult works.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cult works with a nomenclature that's benevolent. They talk about things such as wind farms. What fruit doth grow from this tree? Apples? Pears? What grows from it? Spuds? Nothing. It's not a farm. Of course, here you see the absolute attachment to it. They call them 'renewables'. There's nothing renewable. It's an intermittent power source. They become landfill. Bisphenol, which is part of the blades, is highly toxic. You can't do anything with the blades except bury them. Wind towers are future obsolete trash that is parked on the Australian landscape, and for what? It's because someone is making a buck. Someone is making a big buck, and I'll go through some of that a little later on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to ask ourselves a question: What is the biggest threat? Are you going to go to war against warm weather? Is that what you think will take away your house, threaten your children, take away all your freedoms and take away your property? Is that what you think the threat is, or could the threat possibly be a totalitarian superpower that has the capacity to remove the ownership of your house, to remove your rights, to basically make your children part of a vassal state? For us to stand up against that, we must become as powerful as possible as quickly as possible. It is our only alternative. It is the only thing we should be focused on. Going down this path is not going to allow you to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to know how it is going, I can tell you. Name me one global manufacturer who wants to move to Australia—just one. They're all running for the door—aluminium, steel, plastics, oil refining, manufacturing, even food processing now with Cadbury. They are leaving us. They are going because we are taking this economy nose first into the dirt by having this cultish attachment. Then we have the Peter Pan platitudes that rain out as they read the dot points and the speaking notes from the guru—'These are the notes that you will follow.' The recipe for what we're doing now is seen in the cake we are having to eat. People cannot afford their power bills. That is the reality. Pensioners and people who were doing it tough are now poor. There are people in my area who are off the grid. They just cannot afford their power bill. They cannot pay it. We are doing this to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear these mythical statements about the jobs of the future, the renewable jobs of the future. I will run you through some coal towns. There is Biloela, Gladstone, Muswellbrook, Gunnedah, Singleton, the Port of Newcastle, Lithgow—just to name a few. Where is the renewable town? Where is this town with all these magical jobs that people are doing? It must be there somewhere? There must be one of them. We are told about all these jobs. Where are they? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate there is a town that had over $2 billion spent on 'swindle' farms—let's call them for what they are—swindle factories, where they just rip you off. That's all they are doing. And, if you are dumb enough and gullible enough to be ripped off, you should get ripped off! The population of Glen Innes has gone up by two people. That's pretty good for $2 billion. It is $1 billion a person. What an absolutely remarkable return for that investment! But we continue down this road. So much of what people have said is completely incorrect. This is mad! It is the tulip mania of 2024, where everyone is in the 'south sea bubble', everybody is so enthralled and everybody has drunk the Kool-Aid—but no-one seems to have the ticker to say: 'Hang on. I'm going to look a bit closer into some of this.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So how does this work? Let's see how these swindle factories get around it. They have secret agreements. Minister Bowen said, 'Oh, we can't tell you what they are getting'—these swindle factories—'because it is commercial-in-confidence.' It is the taxpayers' money, for goodness sake! We're entitled to know what they are getting. We hear that they get underwritten for their capital. Even if they produce fairy floss, they get paid. Who pays? The little old taxpayer and the pensioner. The retailer just puts it on your power bill. We have renewable energy credits. We just hand them money. They sell power in five-minute blocks. Imagine if we sold oxygen in five-minute blocks. There would be times in the day when you would be willing to pay a lot of money for that air if you did not have it, and the price of air would go through the roof.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine if you did something reasonable and said, 'If you want to go into this market, you've got to supply power for 24 hours, or for a week,' then all these swindle factories would be out of business because they can't do it. It's intermittent power, it's not renewables. You're forced to buy the product—you have to buy it. There's a quota—you have to buy this product, and whether you like it or not, it's going to be rammed down your throat. And then they come out and the taxpayer pays again. Are they going to pay for 28,000 kilometres of poles and wires? Is there any more featherbedding you can give to these swindle factories?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quickly run through some of these people—these benevolent, environmentally conscious people. Apparently, these people are worried. I just want you to ask yourself the question: do you think these people are worried about the environment or do you think that they think you're a sucker and you need to be ripped off? They're going to take the money out of your pocket. In my area, the Northern Tablelands Wind Farm—7,586 hectares—is owned by Origin, but you've got to remember that Origin is going to be bought out by Brookfield of Canada and EIG Partners in the US. Stringybark Solar Farm is owned by Saudi Arabia; Armidale BESS by GMR Energy and Gore Street Capital, which are Chinese companies; Doughboy Wind Farm is Korean; Bendemeer Renewable Energy Hub is Singaporean; Ben Lomond is Meridian Energy from New Zealand; Infrastructure Capital Group—now Foresight—is from London; the Dungowan Hydro Battery is French; White Rock Renewables is Chinese—Goldwind Science &amp; Technology; Thunderbolt Energy Hub is French; Metsolar is from Saudi Arabia, Abdul Latif Jameel Energy; a company in Inverell is Canadian; and at Loomberah-Timbumburi we have Switzerland and Turkiye. Obviously, people in Turkiye are very worried about Australia these days and cannot get to sleep in Istanbul worrying about the environment in Australia! Then we have Merriwa—well, that's the Maoneng Group in China. I'm sure that in China and Beijing they're up all night, going: 'Gosh! We've got to look after Australia! We're worried about global warming in Australia! We have to help them out!' Or are they thinking, 'These guys down there are complete fools and we're going to take them on.' Hills of Gold Wind Farm is French.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This one's a good one: Calala. Calala is Equis Energy. This was owned by a Nigerian billionaire. He hopped into it and then sold it off to BlackRock in the USA. I'm sure he would have woken up in Nigeria, and said: 'I must help! I must be involved in this gargantuan, titanic struggle to help out Australians in New England to get renewables! It is my life calling!' I think he probably had some good accountants and they said: 'Mate, we're onto it! These clowns will do it and the money just flows out. They underwrite what you earn, subsidise everything you do. You have to buy your product and then you just flip the deal, mate. You just flip the deal and put the balance in your pocket!'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on. You see what it is—we have the Danish, French and the Philippines, with Newman Solar—all of this virtue. These will be obsolete pieces of trash—and that's what they are, static capital in an advanced market. Nuclear will come in, whether you like it or not—it will be like trying to ban mobile phones or colour televisions. It's coming. Then they will be obsolete and, if it's so virtuous, who do you think would be responsible for dismantling them? If it's so virtuous to stick them up, surely the government should think about what they're going to do when it comes to pulling them down? Guess who's responsible for that? The cockie! The good old farmer. Their own ombudsman, Andrew Dyer, says it's $600,000 a pop to dismantle one! Which farmer do you think is going to have $600,000 per tower? None!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now we have banks going out and saying, 'Mate, we're worried about your security.' We had a person in our area who died, tragically. When they went to sell his place, bingo! Caveats on it—they can't just straight sell it. These problems all turn out because they had really good solicitors. These swindle factories have really good accountants and really good solicitors, and suckers for a government. And the government have great advisers. They're in here with the lanyards on, 'Budget time; come on!' They sweet-talk the fourth estate and they drink the Kool Aid—they're in here as well. So much for the ABC and <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span>. When it really does require investigative reporting, no, they won't touch it because they've got you worked out too. The Nigerians, the French and the Chinese—they've got your number. You total and utter suckers. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want zero emissions, then you can only go nuclear. If you said to me, 'What's your alternative?' I don't know. Look at Snowy 2.0. I was sitting at the table when they said it was going to cost $2 billion and I thought that was too much. Then it turned to $4 billion, then $6 billion, then $8 billion and now it's $12 billion. It's heading to $20 billion—for 2,000 megawatts for 10 days? Liddell did 2,000 megawatts 24/7, 365 days a year, and you blew it up. You shut it down. You've got Bundamba. I think that's going to be $14 billion and is going to provide 2,000 megawatts for a day. This is insane. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you realise how this cult has worked—how you've fallen into the trap? Do you sit back and just stare and go, 'Hang on, that can't be right—what we're doing there'? But it is happening. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, you're going to hear Minister Bowen—he used a quote today, and I've got no idea where it's come from but I'm checking it out. You ask, 'Do I believe Minister Bowen? Is it a bird. Is it a plane?' No, it's 'Super-swindle-man'. Do you believe him? Maybe you don't believe me. Maybe you don't believe him. I'll tell you what you should believe: believe your power bill. Believe that letter with the little plastic window that turns up. Believe your power bill; it does not lie. Your power bill is going through the roof because your government is a total and absolute sucker.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  Reducing emissions is at the centre of the Albanese government's plan to boost renewable energy. One of the essential components of that plan will be the Net Zero Economy Authority. It's why I stand today in support of these bills, the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Authority will be a new agency to oversee our nation's transition to net zero emissions by 2050. Its function will be to coordinate policy and planning, facilitate public and private participation—and, importantly, investment—support affected workers, support First Nations Australians to participate in our renewable transition, and deliver educational and promotional initiatives as Australia transitions to a net zero emissions economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government recognises the importance of a swift transition to net zero. It's why we've put Australia on the path to becoming a renewable energy superpower, with over $40 billion invested across the nation. This includes the $20 billion Rewiring the Nation program to modernise our electricity grid and infrastructure so it can support a renewable energy based system; the $1.9 billion Powering the Regions Fund to support the decarbonisation of existing industries and the creation of new clean energy industries; the $4 billion Critical Minerals Facility to grow our critical minerals production sector; the $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program supporting development of large-scale renewable hydrogen projects; and the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund to diversify and transform Australia's industry for a net zero economy. We have also supported Australian industries, workers and communities to participate in that shift to net zero, and our government is actively looking at ways to decarbonise existing industries and develop new green production opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this ambitious action requires a need for coordination, which is one of the functions of the new Net Zero Economy Authority. This authority will be objective driven. It will use resources efficiently to achieve outcomes that drive emissions down, support decarbonisation of industry and, importantly, create new jobs in our new clean energy industries. The authority won't take on the roles of existing government agencies; it will complement, coordinate, identify gaps and contribute to policy development. It will also work with government at state and territory levels to achieve investment in renewables to support our nation's transition to a renewable energy superpower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout this process of our transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewables, it's critical that we support workers and communities. The authority will play an important role in supporting community to understand the transition to a net zero economy, ensuring Australians are both engaged in the process and confident in its outcomes. We will also ensure that workers are not left behind as we build the industries and jobs that underpin our future prosperity. The authority will ensure workers receive the support they need. It will work with employers, unions and others to help workers engage in new opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also establish the legislative framework for an Energy Industry Jobs Plan. Administered by the authority, the plan will enable the use of pooled redeployment arrangements for workers. As coal-fired power stations and gas plants close, there will be a plan to help workers transition directly to a new job. Workers in a closing facility will have opportunities to be redeployed into a new job with another employer in the same or a similar industry. Those businesses on the supply chain will be encouraged to participate voluntarily in the redeployment scheme. We do expect many of our largest coal-fired power stations to put their hands up to participate in our federal government's Energy Industry Jobs Plan as they prepare for closure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholder support for our Net Zero Economy Authority is strong. Jennifer Westacott, the former Business Council chief executive, described it as 'an opportunity for better jobs and better living standards', and Steve Murphy, National Secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, explained, 'It delivers on the promise'. That is what this government has done and what this bill will do. It will ensure our local communities are able to enjoy the opportunities of a clean energy future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills, along with our work on the transition to renewables, are an approach embraced by many, many people in my electorate of Corangamite. Since coming to office, our government has given the green light to a historic 46 renewable energy projects, with another 130 in the pipeline. As a result, we have seen a 25 per cent increase in renewable energy in the national electricity market. This is important progress, but there is so much more to do, and that's what these bills are all about. These bills signal that Australia has an eye on the future. My community has acknowledged this as a welcome change—a climate change policy that is actually reducing emissions and creating clean energy jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in stark contrast to the former coalition government. The Liberals and the Nationals had no legislated target for net zero, no legislated target for emissions reduction, no settled approach to the energy transition, no plan to bring our electricity grid into the 21st century and no policy to ensure replacement capacity of the 24 coal plants that have announced closure dates. Back then, the coalition could not even agree on a long-term energy policy. One former Liberal Premier went so far as to describe it as a 'slow-moving train wreck'. And now, after all this time, the energy policy they've almost settled on is nuclear power, although it's worth noting that they seem to be divided on this policy as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This announcement was coming in weeks, then it was coming in before the budget and now they claim it's coming before the election. Australians know why this announcement has been delayed; they know this will cost taxpayers a fortune and they know it will mean more coal for longer. And they know that the Leader of the Opposition has considered putting a reactor on the Surf Coast. Imagine driving down the Great Ocean Road, the most iconic tourism location in Victoria, passing by Bells Beach, only to be greeted with looming nuclear stacks as you approach the quaint seaside village of Anglesea. Anglesea had a coalmine; it's no longer in use. It has been named in the past, and I know that the people of my electorate beyond and in Anglesea are very anxious about this proposal that had been given in the past. We will wait and see what the announcement brings. I do hope for the people of Anglesea that the local member listens and that this would not be a place for such a reactor. Our energy policy and commitment to renewable energy stands in stark contrast. It offers outcomes rooted in reality, not fantasy. It offers a cleaner net zero future, with lower power prices for all Australians, and the Net Zero Economy Authority will play a significant role in this future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, this is a future that will see Australian workers and communities continue to play a central role in our energy industry. As we transition to net zero, more opportunities for these workers and our communities will emerge. This is an exciting transition. It is one my community embraces, and I stand with them in moving forward to become a renewable superpower. The transition to net zero will push us through the doors of opportunity and create renewable jobs and a cleaner, greener future for our nation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  Before I get into my speech, I was listening to the member for Corangamite. She did mention Anglesea. I would just like to reference an interview that the member for Wannon gave on 24 May this year, when asked about the nuclear industry. When asked whether there would be a reactor in Anglesea, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No. Anglesea was ruled out last year, so there will not be a nuclear fired power plant in Anglesea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there we go; that was very clear from the member for Wannon. It's a bit disappointing when we talk about the most challenging transition that this country is undergoing, that those opposite choose to engage in scare campaigns. They're not prepared to have a debate on the merits, nor to listen to people like the former chief scientist Alan Finkel, who has debated the merits of nuclear. They want to engage in scare campaigns. I think it's very important that we correct the record and answer that for those residents in Anglesea and Corangamite, and have the absolute clarity, as the member for Wannon said, that there will not be a nuclear power plant in Anglesea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024, that we're here to debate, has been called that, it's actually an industrial relations bill. It has little, if anything, to do with the pathway to net zero. What this legislation is looking to do is to move the current Net Zero Economy Agency, which is already an executive agency within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to a standalone authority called the Net Zero Economy Authority. Let's look at what the functions are going to be, because that's a really important part of this new authority. Their functions will be to coordinate net zero policy and planning across government; facilitate both government and private participation and investment; support affected workers; support First Nations Australians to participate in the transition; and deliver educational and promotional initiatives as Australia transitions to a net zero emissions economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will be opposing this bill for many reasons. It's bureaucratic waste and duplication. It's a top-down, Canberra-centric approach which is set to fail on delivering on the unique needs of the regions. It imposes new obligations on small, medium and large businesses. And it is another example of Labor's haphazard approach to industry policy, which delivers no guarantees for local workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said previously, the transition to net zero represents one of the most profound and challenging shifts in human history. It encompasses not only technological but economic change, and it's going to have deep social implications. But it is crucial that, as we transition, we ensure we have cheap and reliable energy. Cheap and reliable energy is what has lifted people in Australia and around the world out of poverty. It is the cornerstone of economic growth, and it allows businesses and communities to grow. When we look at this transition, the most challenging transition, any government and any person genuinely serious about engaging in this discussion must be and should be technology agnostic. You should be prepared to look at any technology that will transition us to net zero as quickly as possible while ensuring we have cheap and reliable power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two broad aspects to this legislation that operationalise the authority's power. The first is facilitating the new investment in the net zero transition. The authority intends to be a shopfront for industry and investors. It will seek to work with project proponents and state governments to get renewable projects to investment decisions. The authority will also look to mobilise public money—through vehicles like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the National Reconstruction Fund—with private finance and support, address and enable infrastructure needs and navigate the regulatory processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just another example of the hypocrisy of this government when it comes to the discussion around nuclear energy and the transition to net zero. The Prime Minister, the minister and those opposite are very quick to criticise nuclear and talk about whether any public money and any taxpayer money will be used for nuclear energy as part of our mix moving forward. They criticise nuclear and say, 'We can't use taxpayer money for nuclear energy,' but they're very happy to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on renewable energy. So the real question is: why is it okay to support one form of zero emissions energy but not another—an energy source that provides baseload zero emissions energy, so crucial to our economy? The government can't answer that because the reason is not science; it's ideology. The government are putting their ideological beliefs above the needs of the Australian people. They're putting their ideological beliefs above the needs of Australian communities—Australian coal communities, Australian farming communities, Australian businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're not prepared to engage in a mature conversation on nuclear energy. All we hear from the minister responsible, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy in this country, are insults and jokes when we're trying to have a mature discussion about the most challenging transition in our country. His transition is already off track. The numbers are showing that he's not going to hit his 42 per cent target. They're not going to deliver their renewables-only approach, and he won't have a conversation about why not. They're not even prepared to take off the moratorium on nuclear and let business decide if it stacks up. Business cannot invest the money in a business case on nuclear, because it's banned in the country. Well, take the moratorium away and let business have a look at whether it stacks up. In only 19 G20 countries is business investing in nuclear, for those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear. Let's look at the science. Those opposite are very quick to talk to the science. Nuclear energy is the only zero-emissions, scalable base load power option that exists. It is the only option around the globe. Renewables are not base load. The batteries are not proven as scalable. And they won't even have a conversation about it. They're not even prepared to put all options on the table.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second responsibility of the authority is assisting the impacted workers in the transition area through the Energy Industry Jobs Plan. That plan's going to allow the authority to utilise the industrial relations system to manage the redeployment of workers in closing coal-fired and gas-fired power stations and their dependent employers. But the plan does not specify or anticipate the types of employment that workers may transition into. In his address to the National Press Club earlier this year, the current Net Zero Economy Agency chair, Greg Combet, could not give a guarantee on the transition of coal power station workers to green jobs in the renewables sector. There is a genuine and real risk that these workers will be left with fewer employment opportunities and lower rates of pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we look at nuclear as a discussion. As the Leader of the Opposition and many experts have said, one of the benefits of nuclear is that it can go in existing coal power station sites. Not only does that reduce the cost through existing transmission lines—the environmental cost of 28,000 kilometres of new transmission lines, the money of installing those, the access to workers—by utilising those already there; it also creates genuine, long-term jobs in the coal communities that are losing their current coal plants. It can create some different jobs with nuclear technicians, no doubt, but those that have the cleaning contracts for a coal power plant can also have the cleaning contracts for a nuclear plant in the same location. Those that go to the local footy club, the grocery store—all those secondary jobs that are created for an industry like this—would continue to exist. It's nice to say that you've got an authority that's going to find jobs for workers, but, if there are no businesses, there's no work for them. Again, that is another one of the opportunities and advantages of nuclear that those opposite, this government, aren't even prepared to have a conversation about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, this authority is full of duplication and full of waste. The investment facilitation aspects of the proposed authority duplicate the role of existing funding agencies such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the role of existing mechanisms such as the Major Projects Facilitation Agency. The level of duplication of the proposed Net Zero Economy Authority's responsibilities to promote new investment in the net zero transition and existing Commonwealth entities is just beyond a joke. It's creating another level of bureaucracy to what's already there. It's money that's being spent in a top-down approach, with a Canberra-centric focus. Over a billion dollars of federal funds in the forward estimates has been put forward to duplicate projects and initiatives that are already there. For example, there are regional planning initiatives that already exist through the New South Wales government's Hunter Regional Plan and the Victorian government's Latrobe Valley authority transition plan. So you've got plans in these communities that are going to be duplicated by a federal plan—waste. The new authority would also cut across the work and vision of the existing Regional Development Australia committees, which recognise that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to creating vibrant regions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is going to drive bureaucratic duplication and it's also going to negatively impact small and family businesses. It's important to note that the larger risk in this legislation is not for the large energy-generating companies but for small businesses who supply goods and services to a closing power station, who may be caught up in this energy industry job plan process. These businesses don't have HR or internal workplace lawyers and are unlikely to have any line of sight of what's coming. It's so important that we continue to protect these small businesses, and there's no carve-out for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will oppose the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill because it's bureaucratic waste and duplication and it's a top-down, Canberra-centric approach, which is set to fail on delivering on the unique needs of the regions. It imposes new obligations on small, medium and large businesses, and the fact is that it's another example of Labor's haphazard approach on industry policy, which delivers no guarantees for local workers. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  I welcome this critical step forward in Australia's transition towards net zero, which itself is necessary to tackle dangerous climate change. It's also necessary to ensure that Australia derives the greatest possible benefits from a global energy, technology and industrial transformation that is moving substantially and moving quickly. We can't afford to be left behind in that transformation. We've known for a long time, based on expert scientific advice and economic analysis, that making a swift, fair and well-planned transition will deliver the best economic outcomes, not to mention the best social and environmental outcomes. That's what this bill helps to deliver through the Net Zero Economy Authority. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a statement of the obvious to say that leading Australia through the global energy transformation requires serious, careful and comprehensive good management—an approach that was completely absent during the lost decade of coalition mismanagement, especially when it comes to energy policy. It wasn't just a complete policy vacuum—as the minister mentioned earlier today, there were 22 different draft energy policies, none of which ever landed—but it was often also an exercise in policy and program vandalism. Australians shouldn't forget that the coalition, in addition to never managing to land a single national energy policy, also tried to get rid of the foundational building blocks of clean energy transformation that Labor created during the Rudd-Gillard government, namely the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. The member for Casey before was talking about these things in a way that suggested he understood their value. He wasn't in the parliament when his colleagues on that side sought to defund them and get rid of them altogether.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, the Albanese government is once again taking on the responsibility of leading Australia through the circumstances of a global transition that does present enormous opportunities, not least because we're a country that's blessed with the right critical minerals and the best renewable energy resources. We've got the chance before us—and, I would say, the obligation upon us—to set up Australia for a bright and sustainable future and for a future that is made in Australia by Australians for Australians. That's 100 per cent our focus. We're seeking to do that through a consultative and constructive approach. We'd love that to be constructive as far as the parliament as a whole. Clearly the coalition is continuing on with saying: 'We've got no ideas. We'll accept no reform. We'll accept no change. We're not interested in anything positive. We're not interested in anything constructive.' That's a shame.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of our approach is a set of arrangements developed in consultation with unions, industry and employers that in turn have shaped what is in effect a tripartite approach that will guide us along the best path as older industries are transformed and new enterprises emerge. This tripartite approach of government working collaboratively with unions and with industry and employers will mean that the changes we need to make will happen through a process that is open, consultative and fair. We'll ensure that workers and households in affected communities, especially rural and regional communities, where a lot of this transition will occur, have a clear voice in shaping that change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that point, I do want to acknowledge the strong and sustained advocacy, the unstinting and focused advocacy, of the labour movement with respect to the value of a tripartite approach, especially the AMWU's Steve Murphy and, from my home state of Western Australia, Steve McCartney; my very good friend, the ETU's Michael Wright; and, of course, the mighty ASU, AWU and MEU.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, the Net Zero Economy Authority, which this bill advances, will make a massive positive difference in shaping the transition that is already well underway. The need for this kind of coordination, advice, leadership and oversight has been understood for some time. Indeed, when the global community settled the Paris climate agreement back in 2016, the need to guide and manage the transition—what was described as a just transition—to net zero was set out clearly with expectations that signatory nations would put in place exactly what we are discussing today: an authority that can help guide the best form of the transition in all the sensible ways that will logically occur. That's what this authority will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will provide leadership to ensure coordination and consistency in the design and implementation of policies and programs across a range of areas. As part of that, it will provide advice and reports on progress to the minister. It will facilitate and promote public and private sector investment in emission reduction and the full range of net zero transformation initiatives, harnessing what the CEFC has delivered—not taxpayer dollars going into initiatives but funds that are lent on a commercial basis and have delivered a very healthy return to government whilst enabling investment in and the development of these kinds of new initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority will support workers in affected industries, including with job matching and skills development through the implementation of the Energy Industry Jobs Plan, a task that needs to occur as we see some industries shift and change—coal-fired power, for example, which won't be a big part of Australia's future, while at the same time we see offshore wind and billions of dollars of work in the decommissioning of oil and gas as another offshore industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority will make sure that communities benefit from the transition and that they not just see these things occur but actually take up the opportunity to benefit directly from that transition, with a particular focus on First Nations communities. That is hugely welcome. The authority will also take on the broad work of raising awareness about what's involved in and promoting active engagement in various parts of our shift to net zero, helping people to understand the options, opportunities and benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure that people in the community who hear about all those aspects of the Net Zero Economy Authority would think to themselves: 'Surely this is a no-brainer. Surely this is something we would have known was going to be necessary some time ago and we would have put in place as soon as possible.' Perhaps, even on that basis, people might wonder, 'Has this kind of authority, this kind of function, occurred anywhere else?' The answer is: of course. In the United States, they have the American Jobs Plan, which was created back in 2021. In the United Kingdom, they have the UK Green Jobs Taskforce, which was launched back in 2020. Both of those had very similar functions in looking at the transformation that occurs when saying: 'This kind of activity will decrease and these other kinds of activities will increase. What workers are there in an area that is going to decrease? What are their opportunities in new initiatives? How do the skills that they have match?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In many cases, the analysis that was done that underpinned both the American jobs and the UK jobs taskforces said there was quite a large overlap between the skills in some of the industries that we will see less of as we get out of fossil fuels and those we'll need as we move towards a net zero economy. Some of the skills transferred very well into emerging industries like offshore wind, large-scale solar and storage and the decommissioning task in relation to offshore oil and gas that I have described.</span>

                    </a>  Wherever it helps, just to answer the member for O'Connor. There's a famous wind farm in my electorate, at Rottnest. I remember former prime minister Tony Abbott coming over and almost suggesting he was going to knock down that wind turbine which helps Rottnest Island and its park have energy self-sufficiency. We have no problem with wind in my community—don't worry about that—and I expect there's no problem in your community either. There is already one there, Member for O'Connor. What there won't be is a fantasy in the form of a small modular reactor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We haven't had the benefit of the work I've described, because the coalition simply failed to care about responding to climate change and failed to put in place the arrangements to guide our transition to a net zero economy and to carry out our role as a renewable energy superpower. We are taking a different approach. We are not going to be derelict in our obligation to show leadership and effective management as an Australian government. The Australian community deserves to have in this place, in the parliament and as a government, an outfit that sees the challenges and doesn't bury its head in the sand and doesn't entertain some of the fantasies that the member for Casey was talking about before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My God, on this rubbish about having a mature conversation about nuclear, people should wake up. We have talked about nuclear in a mature, sensible, consistent, comprehensive, in-depth, exhaustive way for years and years. The former government says there's this proposition that needs to occur to remove the moratorium on large-scale nuclear. Who created that? Who put that there? That was put there by the Howard government. In 10 years of the previous government they not once considered removing that moratorium. When the current energy spokesperson on the other side chaired the environment and energy committee inquiry into nuclear energy, it concluded that there was no case for removing the moratorium for large-scale nuclear. So this is a fantasy grasping at straws about nuclear energy when every bit of evidence in every inquiry over a long period of time has shown that it is absolutely not in Australia's interest. It just goes to show the poverty of common sense, policy development and leadership on that side. Fortunately, we don't have to worry about the things they are not going to do. We have a government that is squarely taking on the task that faces the global community—tackling climate change and managing the transition to a net zero economy. We are doing that, and this bill is a big step in that direction.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the related bill. I will not be supporting this ludicrous legislation. Like many communities right across the country, my electorate of Capricornia is experiencing the full brunt of this government's ideological push for the irresponsible net zero target. In the Rockhampton region alone, the numerous wind farms are scarring the landscape of untouched remnant vegetation and prime agricultural land, while, in the north of the electorate, locals in the Eungella region are facing a David-and-Goliath battle to stop the state Labor government's attempt to build what they are describing as the world's largest pumped hydro scheme. Community groups already navigating a complex array of departmental regulation to oppose industrial-scale renewable energy projects near their homes now face increased government pressure favouring companies investing in renewable energy, in the form of this Net Zero Economy Authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Authority's primary purpose is to facilitate new investment in the net zero transition. It aims to serve as a shopfront for industry and investors and to work closely with project proponents and state governments to advance renewable projects to the investment decision stage. Additionally, the authority will mobilise public funds through the likes of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the National Reconstruction Fund. To note just how well this government's National Reconstruction Fund is performing, to date not one cent has been spent from the $15 billion intended to assist industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Authority aims to expedite the development of green energy projects, leveraging public investments to attract further private sector involvement and hasten progress towards net zero emissions at a rushed pace. I am witnessing firsthand the significant impact of this rushed approach towards achieving 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030. This hasty push will have long-lasting consequences for generations of Australians. One major concern is the loss of prime agricultural land which has been converted for large-scale industrial renewable energy projects. This not only threatens our agriculture output and food security but also disrupts the livelihoods of many rural communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover, the substantial financial burden on the public purse cannot be ignored. The aggressive drive for renewable energy is leading to enormous public expenditures which may not be sustainable in the long term. The reckless pace of this transition risks prioritising short-term gains over thoughtful strategic planning, ultimately jeopardising both our economy and our environment. Generations of Australians will feel the repercussions of this approach, facing both the economic impacts and the challenges of adapting to a transformed landscape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask those opposite: how many have sat on the verandah of a local grazier's home and met with people who are being directly impacted by this rush for unrealistic renewable energy targets? How many have sat with a farmer with a young family, who intended to pass his hard work and investment on to his children, only for it to be ripped away in the name of renewable energy targets? I have, and I must say that it is heartbreaking to see how these communities in regional Australia are being bulldozed away to make sure those who live in the city can feel good when they turn on a light. The human impact, the toll it is taking on regional Australia, is immeasurable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation put forward is another nail in the coffin for these communities to fight back against renewable energy projects which are being placed in irresponsible locations. The Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project is a prime example of a renewable energy project which will destroy one of Australia's most pristine natural wilderness areas. Initially estimated at a cost of $12 billion, this project has already blown out enormously to an astonishing $18 billion. If the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project is to be anything like the Snowy 2.0 shambles, which has been propped up by extensive federal funding, it is a dire sign of taxpayer money being spent with abandon to achieve net zero dreams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation before us is problematic for several reasons. Firstly, it contributes to bureaucratic waste and duplication, adding unnecessary layers of administration without tangible benefits. The approach being proposed is top-down and centred in Canberra, which makes it ill-suited to addressing the unique needs of regional areas. The centralised method is bound to fail in effectively serving the diverse parts of different communities. Additionally, the legislation imposes new obligations on businesses of all sizes: small, medium and large. These added responsibilities could hinder business operations and growth, creating more challenges than solutions for the business sector. Moreover, this proposal exemplifies Labor's inconsistent and erratic approach to industry policy. It lacks clear guarantees for local workers, leaving their employment and wellbeing uncertain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of the significant flaws in this piece of legislation, we found out in the budget that the government has doubled the authority's budget to $399.1 million from 2023-24 to 2026-27, with further funding to total $1.1 billion over the medium term. The federal government cannot afford to waste over $1 billion on Canberra bureaucrats across the Net Zero Economy Authority, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, and the Fair Work Commission, especially when it has been unable to detail the actions this authority will perform that are not already being done. The potential for bureaucratic inefficiency, the one-size-fits-all strategy, the burdens on businesses and the absence of assured benefits for local workers make it a flawed proposal. The significant increase in the authority's budget, amounting to over $1 billion, is an unjustifiable expenditure given the lack of clear, additional benefits it would provide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Authority is weaving a tangled web of bureaucratic confusion, with the facility largely duplicating the responsibilities already managed by the existing federal and state agencies. The authority is explicitly tasked with:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… facilitating public and private sector participation and investment in greenhouse gas emissions reduction and net zero transformation initiatives in Australia, including in new industries …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This mandate aims to drive significant engagement and funding towards reducing emissions and fostering new industries geared towards a net zero economy. However, this role appears to closely mirror the Clean Energy Finance Corporation's legislated responsibility, which is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To facilitate increased flows of finance into the clean energy sector and to facilitate the achievement of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The overlap in responsibilities raises concerns about the necessity and efficiency of the new authority, given that similar functions are already being performed by existing agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How many federal agencies tasked with renewable financing does the Commonwealth require? The abundance of such agencies raises questions about efficiency and necessity, as overlapping responsibilities can lead to bureaucratic redundancy and wasted resources. This approach, focused on facilitating investment consistent with net zero ambitions, also leans into the government's preference for picking winners rather than fostering genuine investment facilitation and job creation. By selectively supporting certain initiatives, the government risks neglecting broader, potentially more impactful opportunities. It is also likely that, once established, the federal government will continue to add additional powers and responsibilities to the authority to support its net zero and climate ambitions. This potential for expanded authority raises the question: will the government rule out giving this Net Zero Economy Authority new powers to streamline and expedite regulatory approvals or financing for transformational green energy projects?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said previously, the funding for this authority and its related activities is budgeted at $399.1 million from 2023-24 to 2026-27, with further funding totalling $1.1 billion over the medium term. This substantial allocation is on top of the billions of dollars of additional funding being channelled into the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the newly branded Future Made in Australia initiative. Despite these significant investments, over $13 billion in taxpayer funded subsidies for big businesses do not address the root causes of Labor's cost-of-living crisis. Green hydrogen and critical minerals being pushed by billionaires should stand up on their own merit without the need for taxpayers' money. Labor's focus should be on addressing energy costs, high inflation and out-of-control red tape. Instead, Labor continuously fails to tackle the fundamental issues facing most Australian businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With insolvencies at record highs and more businesses moving offshore, supporting a small number of big businesses is irresponsible and a slap in the face to small businesses desperately seeking answers from this government to survive. The duplication of efforts between the Net Zero Economy Authority and existing Commonwealth institutions highlights a complete waste of over $1 billion of federal government funds over the forward estimates. The Net Zero Economy Authority Bill represents another pie-in-the-sky, rushed piece of legislation that will not help my constituents in Capricornia. The promise of local jobs for local people within the renewable energy sector remains unfulfilled, further illustrating the disconnect between the government's ambitious plans and the practical needs of the community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Defence Industry and Minister for International Development and the Pacific</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  It's with enormous pride that I rise to make a contribution on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024. This is an incredibly important bill not just for Australia as a whole but, in particular, for my region, the mighty Hunter and Central Coast region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of the contribution my region makes to our nation. We provide fully 25 per cent of the nation's electricity. We've got Vales Point power station in my electorate. We've got Colongra gas station in my electorate, which is the largest gas-fired power station in New South Wales. Over the other side of the lake, we've got Eraring power station, which is the largest power station in the country, and up the valley we've got Bayswater. We've also got the proud contribution that Lake Munmorah and Wangi power stations made in their day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We truly powered this nation. We industrialised this nation during a period of cheap coal-fired electricity in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and running into the 1980s. That is the contribution that the Hunter made historically, and we continue to make a contribution that is massive in its proportion today. But the truth is that those power stations have either been retired or will soon be retired due to the age of the plant. Vales Point power station was built in the late 1960s, Eraring in the early 1980s and Bayswater in the late 1970s. We have already had Lake Munmorah power station close down. These power stations are reaching the end of their technical lives not because of government policy but because of base engineering. So the question is: what do we, as a government and as a nation, do to honour the commitment of the workers, and the communities based upon them, and to look after them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that we had thousands of megawatts of coal-fired electricity close down under the last government without adequate support. The most stark example of that was Hazelwood power station, which closed with less than five months notice, throwing out hundreds of workers and contractors without adequate support. An activist Victorian government intervened to look after some of them, but the truth is that we should have—and could have—done much more. That's what this bill is all about, and that's why I'm so proud of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of this bill is the pooled redundancy model for displaced power station workers and workers in captured coalmines associated with those power stations. We've got choices here. We can repeat the errors of the past in Australia. We can go down the route that we've seen in other countries—for example, what happened to coalmining in places like Appalachia in the United States—or we can be much more progressive and much more interventionist, recognising the structural inequity and the challenges that face regions like mine when we see mass redundancy events. I for one am all for intervention to support my community. I have looked at the model that German governments, both Left and Right, Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, participated in over the course of 40 years in the German coalmining industry. They went from having hundreds of thousands of employees in coalmining in the 1950s to ending black-coal mining a couple of years ago without a single forced redundancy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the pooled redundancy aspect of this legislation is so important. The legislation gives the authority roles around bringing forward the Energy Industry Jobs Plan, which involves meeting with workers on the ground to understand their needs; connecting them with training, financial advice and other individual supports; helping their transition to alternative jobs; and offering participation in the redeployment scheme. This is critical to giving workers associated with these power stations opportunities when the power stations close down because of the commercial decisions of the power station owners—not because of governments but because of the commercial decisions of the owners of those power stations. That is an incredibly important role for this authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to the Mining and Energy Union for their leadership on this issue for decades, and I'll return to that shortly. Their leadership has driven this process, and I'm proud of the small role that I was privileged to play in the design of some of these policies when I had some of the shadow ministerial responsibilities. That's one aspect of this bill that is so critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other aspect of this bill that is critical is the future economic opportunities. How do we grow more manufacturing jobs in this country? Just as this country industrialised on the back of cheap coal-fired power in the 1950s and 1960s, we can grow even more manufacturing jobs on the basis of cheap renewable energy in the next few decades. That could drive a new generation of manufacturing. It is a fact that over 90 per cent of the world's photovoltaic cells are based on technology developed at the world's best research institution for PV, which is the University of New South Wales—in my mate the member for Kingsford Smith's electorate. It's great, world-leading research that is on roofs around the world. But the truth is that we got zero manufacturing jobs out of that because the Howard government allowed that technology to be sent overseas without any attempts to commercialise it here and generate a world-scale manufacturing industry. That cannot be allowed to happen again as we look to the next generation of renewable energy industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why our policies are so important. We have 50 per cent of the world's lithium resources, but we export it mostly in a raw form overseas. We need to be transforming it in this country, value adding and growing more manufacturing jobs. That is why this new authority, with its focus on managing economic change, complements the $40 billion in government initiatives to reduce emissions and become a renewable energy superpower. They include the $20 billion Rewiring the Nation program to modernise the electricity grid, the $1.9 billion Powering the Regions Fund and a $6 billion critical minerals facility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm particularly passionate about the green hydrogen opportunities. We should be the best place in the world to make green hydrogen and we should be the best place in the world to combine that green hydrogen with our great iron ore resources and make green steel. I want to see the Hunter Valley, and Newcastle in particular, making steel for decades to come. The Grattan Institute's report into green steel a few years ago demonstrated the opportunities in this area where we can compete and win green steel opportunities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that these new opportunities will not be generated in places like North Sydney or Southbank; they will be generated in our regions. Projects that decarbonise industrial facilities and build new industries will grow the future economic base of regions like my own Hunter Valley, the Gladstone region, the Latrobe Valley and the Upper Spencer Gulf. I was so proud to be at the old Liddell power station site last month for the launch of our Solar SunShot program, which focuses on building manufacturing jobs and building solar photovoltaic cells. One company there that we are partnering with will employ more people at that site than the Liddell power station employed at its prime. So that is incredibly important for our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must seize these economic opportunities. We have a great opportunity right now to harness this clean-energy industrial revolution. We need to learn the lessons from past industrial revolutions. You do need an interventionist government to drive this process. You cannot leave it to the market unaided, because all the technology will be shipped offshore and we will lose the critical competitive advantages we have. That is why this bill is so critical to a region like mine, and it is why I am profoundly proud of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I want to pay tribute to a couple of actors in the process. I've already thanked the Mining and Energy Union but, in particular, I want to call out Tony Maher, a person who has committed decades of service to fighting for his workers in both the mining industry—the coalmining industry in particular—and the energy sector. This bill is his legacy. This bill shows his pragmatism and his commitment to looking after his members and his community. I pay tribute to him and all the other activists in the MEU for their role in driving this conversation and this achievement. I also want to pay tribute to my mentor Greg Combet, in his role as the first chair of the Net Zero Economy Authority. He set the groundwork for this. He did great work on this. This topped off decades of contribution in fighting for workers in our country, particularly in regions like mine. I want to thank Greg Combet for his service in this role and wish him the best of luck in his future role with the Future Fund. This bill is incredibly important to our nation and incredibly important to our region, and I commend it to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm talking about jobs and services in my community, I want to quickly express my disappointment in Australia Post closing down the licensed office at Windale. This was a voluntary process through the Australia Post buyback process, but I am concerned about the loss of postal services in my community. I've met with the Minister for Communications, and we're working very hard to maintain postal services in Windale, which is a beautiful part of my community.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:14</span>):  Deputy Speaker Vasta, I'm sure that you've been around this place long enough to have heard a lot of things. We hear a lot here. There is one thing I don't hear when I'm down in my region in the great state of Tasmania, at the epicentre of small business in the north-west, on the west coast and in King Island. Constituents just don't come up to me and say things like, 'Gav, I wish we had more bureaucrats.' I've never heard it. They never say things like, 'This Canberra-centric approach is really working for me and my business, and it's making my life that much easier.' I've never heard that. They never say things like, 'Don't worry, Gav, Canberra will look after us. If you can't trust the government, who can you trust?' I've never heard that either—not once, not ever, nil, nada, zip, zero. And, frankly, I'm not holding my breath.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we think about this legislation, the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024, we just need to cast our minds back to Labor's failed Voice referendum. There are a lot of lessons that we should all have gleaned from that process. There was something in that for all of us. But one in particular was that people living in the regions are sick and tired of city based bureaucrats telling them how they should think, what they should think about and how they should feel. It offends them. It offends them deeply, because bureaucrats rarely understand what it's like on the ground, and they rarely understand what it's like to run a business, to borrow money, to employ people, to take risks, to work 24/7, to give to your employees before you take for yourself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've run a lot of businesses in my time, and I would literally, genuinely and faithfully feed and give to my employees before I took for myself. The mark of a leader—and I learnt this in the military—is that leaders eat last. It's no different in small business. I'm sick of the stories that come up from time to time in this place hammering employers because they are apparently taking the mickey out of their employees. Well, that rarely happens. It might happen in occasional cases, in exceptions to the norm, but, 99 times out of 100, most small-business operators think the world of their people. They're the livelihood of their business. It's time that this government understood that it is impossible to understand the unique needs of regional Australia when you're sitting behind a desk in Canberra. Unfortunately, it is blatantly clear that Labor has not learnt or continues to refuse to listen, and these bills before us today are a clear reminder of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Business is doing it damn tough. Small and medium-sized businesses have done it tough for the last two years. It's a sad indictment of the government that one of the only things that they've managed to deliver is an insolvency crisis across the Australian economy of small and medium-sized businesses. According to data recently released by ASIC, insolvencies across construction have already exceeded the annual 2022-23 figures. Small and medium-sized manufacturing business insolvencies are set to exceed the 2022-23 figures by the end of this month. Insolvencies across the whole economy are already three times higher than under the last year of the coalition's government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If your business has managed to stay afloat, the situation is dire. I don't mean to be a pessimist, but it is. One in five small businesses are now struggling to pay their energy bills. Nearly half of all small businesses are concerned about their ability to pay future energy bills. More than one in three small to medium-sized enterprises have experienced energy hardships during the past 12 months, and rising energy costs are cited as the No. 1 factor. Labor's focus should be on supporting small and medium-sized business enterprises and working with employers to navigate the processes that they need to run their businesses. They should be dealing with the crisis that they made, implementing strategies to combat rising energy costs, high inflation and out-of-control red and green tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation imposes little risk on the large players in the energy market, by the way—companies like AGL, Origin and EnergyAustralia. The total risk of this legislation will be borne by smaller business operators, by the subcontractors who supply the goods and services in the shutdown and closing down power stations. These businesses don't have an HR department. They don't have a department that deals with red and green tape. They don't have accountants doing their taxes. They're probably mum-and-dad businesses that work hand in hand to keep their heads above water on a daily basis. These businesses don't have internal workplace lawyers—and I'm grateful for that, I can tell you. These businesses don't have the capacity to administer the services outlined in this bill. In large part, these businesses have absolutely no idea what's coming down the pipeline for them and won't until it's too late. The imposition of the new obligations contained within this legislation will simply send more businesses to the wall, and I can never support that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's never the right time for government to waste taxpayers' money subsidising big business, but it is unforgivable during a cost-of-living crisis of their making. It's unforgivable that the Albanese government is heading down this path while small and medium businesses are forced into insolvency at record numbers, as I've already stated. In the 2024-25 budget, this authority and related activities are funded at $399.1 million from 2023-24 to 2026-27. Add to that a further $1.1 billion over the medium term. This is on top of the billions of dollars of additional funding being moved into the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the newly badged Future Made in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what do you get for this investment? That's what most businesspeople ask. What do you get for this investment of your hard-earned taxpayer dollars? You get an authority that duplicates what other agencies are already doing. We've got the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We've got the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the role of existing mechanisms such as the Major Projects Facilitation Agency. And there are also the state based duplications such as the New South Wales government's Hunter Regional Plan, the Victorian government's Latrobe Valley Authority transitional plan and the work and vision of existing Regional Development Australian committees, which recognise that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to creating vibrant regions. This is like the start of a bad joke. It's like an episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Utopia</span>, fair dinkum. How many federal agencies does it take for the government to deliver renewable financing?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our pathway to decarbonise the Australian economy must be ambitious, optimistic and aspirational, but it also needs to be practical and it needs to be achievable. Practical Australians out there, like the ones running the businesses in the great state of Tasmania, share a common goal as we make our transition towards net zero. It's simple. This is Humphrey B Bear stuff. Australians want clean power that's reliable and affordable at the same time. It needs to be achievable.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Albanese government took charge of our renewable energy transition, they enshrined in law the emissions reduction target of 43 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. A key assumption of this target was that Australia will generate 82 per cent of electricity from renewable sources by that time. There was a lot of work to do; I admit that. To meet the 43 per cent reduction target, the speed and the scale of this transition will need to be unprecedented. It is estimated that, for Labor to meet that 2030 target over the next seven years, they will need to do the following: install 22,000 solar panels every single day, build 40 wind turbines every single month, lay more than 28,000 kilometres of transmission lines and, estimates also assume, have no increase to the demand for energy over that time. We all know that is a pipedream.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, their entire energy policy was a pipe dream, and it is unravelling very quickly before everyone's eyes and, particular, those small business operators that are just shaking their heads in disbelief. Under Labor's watch we are now paying amongst the highest prices for electricity in the developed world. Our electricity grid is now vulnerable, and emissions are increasing not decreasing. That is a fact. It's not inner-city Melbourne or Sydney and it's not Canberra that's feeling the impact of Labor's uncoordinated and ad hoc push towards this emissions reduction target. It's regional Australia that's being burnt—it's the bush. It's the people that can't afford it, the people that are trying to earn a living, the people that are growing food and the real people doing real jobs that matter—and they're feeling it worse. The challenges faced by them are not uniform across each rural electorate or community. Each region has its own unique set of circumstances. As such, each region will require local understanding and community driven solutions. Heaven forbid, what an idea!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Never, ever can this be done by adding yet another layer of Canberra bureaucracy into the mix. Solutions driven by highly paid public servants who think that they know best will always fail. I've seen it before. I firmly believe in small government and free enterprise. I believe our nation's energy transition is best left to the free market, unencumbered by government intervention. Government inserting itself simply produces a false market. This authority is being set up for exactly that purpose: to pick winners and to dictate preferred technologies. All that this will result in is a complete market distortion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every decision Labor has made recently in relation to our energy market is only putting Australia and its energy security at risk. I cannot in good conscience support this bill. </span>

The Net Zero Economy Authority forms part of our government's bigger, bolder, more prosperous vision for Australia's future. It's a vision that sees our country with more secure and fulfilling jobs in industries that will transform our economy, our energy production and our exports. It's a vision of leadership in the transition as we support the decarbonisation of the major nations in our region with our exports of green energy. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this presents massive opportunities for Australia. As Assistant Minister Gorman stated on the introduction of the bill, 'The opportunities will not seize themselves,' and so we here are charged with doing what we can to ensure that Australia seizes the opportunities that are open to us.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had a few conversations with people recently where I've had to stress that the transition—being the green energy transition or the transition to net zero—doesn't happen all of a sudden. It's not about bringing our existing economic activity to a halt without having something ready to replace it with. The very word 'transition' denotes some sort of orderly, stepped process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had an orderly process so far, legislatively speaking. We legislated the targets for 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050, and we adopted the target for 82 per cent renewables by 2030. We embarked upon targeted policies that are intended, both by carrot and stick, to ensure that those targets are met—the safeguard mechanism, the National Reconstruction Fund, the Rewiring the Nation project, the Hydrogen Headstart program, the Powering the Regions Fund—as well as pulling the levers to ensure over time that the requisite workers are available and trained with the skills they need, as many will be through our massive targeted fee-free TAFE policy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The core mission of the Net Zero Economy Authority is to facilitate the transition of workers from emissions-intensive sectors to new sustainable job opportunities. This is not merely a matter of economic adjustment; it is about ensuring that those who have powered our industries for decades are not left behind as we embrace cleaner technologies and methods.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Almost every single day, hardworking Australians speak to me about the cost of living, and they have multiple concerns. For some, it's the very high cost of their mortgages and their struggles to pay their mortgages and to provide anything but the essentials for themselves and for their families. For others, it's their struggle to find somewhere to rent, and, if they're lucky enough to find somewhere to live, the rental cost makes it so hard for them to be able to afford it and, again, provide more than simply the essentials for themselves and for their families. I will come back to the issue of housing affordability shortly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone is facing rising costs of food and electricity, and there are more examples of people having to reduce their food budget simply because they can afford less now than they used to. I'm hearing all too often that people are buying, for example, cheaper cuts of meat instead of seafood or the lowest-cost grocery items that they can find, and in some cases they're actually going without, simply to get by. I'm hearing from retailers that people are buying less and that they are having to reduce their margins simply to move stock and stay afloat. There are some interesting articles that have been published recently, and one that I read while I was preparing for tonight's speech was written by business reporter Kate Ainsworth. She included some information and some data that was released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics earlier this week which shows retail sales have continued to flatline since the start of the year. She goes on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Collectively, Australians spent $19.5 million less on clothing, footwear and personal accessories in April. Compared to March, spending in this category declined by 0.7 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Spending on household goods increased by $37.7 million, or 0.7 per cent in April, and retail spending across the country is 1.3 per cent higher than it was a year ago, albeit driven by a population that's around 2.5 per cent larger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She went on to quote Paul Zahra, the chief executive of the Australian Retailers Association, who said, 'There's a lot of window shopping going on; that's about it.' That's what we're seeing on the Gold Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm certainly hearing that sales in the hospitality sector are worsening. Four to six months ago, people were reducing the amount that they spent but were still going to coffee shops and restaurants. Now, I'm hearing that customer numbers are down, and this further reduces the amount of revenue that owners are able to receive—they're starting to think about what they can do, and that includes reducing the hours of the staff they have employed there. The impacts of the cost-of-living crisis in which we find ourselves are becoming more and more severe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I return to the issue relating to housing affordability, including homeownership and rentals. For some context, my electorate of McPherson is on the southern end of the Gold Coast, from Clear Island Waters and Merrimac in the north right through to the New South Wales-Queensland border at Coolangatta. What do prices look like in my electorate at the moment? For rentals, in Robina, which is towards the northern part of my electorate, around the middle of the Gold Coast, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house will cost you upwards of about $785 a week. At the southern end of the electorate, at Coolangatta, a three-bedroom, one-bathroom house will cost you upwards of around $875 per week to rent. At Elanora, which is a popular suburb for families, a three-bedroom, one-bathroom house will cost you around $850 per week. If you then start to look at the cost to purchase, it's variable, clearly, across the coast. But, if you're looking at a three-bedroom townhouse, you're looking at upwards of $750,000, and that is well away from the popular coastal strip.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While there is an increase in construction along the Gold Coast, it is right along the Gold Coast highway, which is not affordable for many people on the Gold Coast. It is designed primarily for the tourist population to come and visit the Gold Coast—which is important, but it means locals are being pushed further west, where there is limited to no public transport available, so they need to factor that in as well. I call on all levels of government to work together to solve what is now a cost-of-living crisis in this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a long history of supporting people with diabetes. Labor first established the Insulin Pump Program in 2008. The insulin pump helps diabetes patients by reducing the needle pain, and in 2022 the Labor government introduced a subsidy for the next generation of insulin pumps, bringing the average price down from over $400 a month to a maximum co-payment of $29 a month. I'm proud to be part of a government that's reducing Nik's pain and reducing the financial burden on his parents through the Insulin Pump Program.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282237" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ARCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  When the Albanese government was elected two years ago, it was on the promise that no-one would be left behind. Time and again, the now Prime Minister promised that his would be a government that cared, that no-one would be left behind and that people would do better under his leadership. Two years on and my community is asking when this government will deliver on those promises. Labor's signature cost-of-living announcement has seen their now legislated changes to the stage 3 tax cuts. At best, it is a modest offset to cost-of-living pressures and it's kicked the can down the road in dealing with bracket creep. It is more politically expedient than it will be tangibly beneficial in the long run. The average Tasmanian mortgagee has seen their repayments increase over $1,000 per month since May 2022. Rents have gone up as well. There are rising costs across all areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also important to note is that low- and middle-income earners will still be effectively paying more tax than they were when this government came to office without the continuation of the low and middle income tax offset. The energy relief of $300 is a bit disappointing, and the fact that it's not more targeted seems wasteful. Again, it is at best a temporary sugar hit that is more about politics than substance and perhaps a missed opportunity to maximise relief to those in greatest need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to recognise that cost-of-living pressures do not impact everyone in our community equitably, with those on fixed incomes and government payments particularly impacted by rising costs. Despite the recommendations of the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee ahead of the budget, the government has, for the most part, resisted acting on those recommendations and calls from welfare advocacy groups, providing very little relief in this budget. Housing measures announced may go some way towards addressing these challenges in the years ahead, but housing availability and affordability remains an urgent priority for all levels of government. There seems to be little in the budget to address the short-term need either in the provision of housing or in boosting funding to frontline services and emergency providers. The need on the ground remains dire, with a horrifying number of northern Tasmanians experiencing homelessness. Services are unable to cope with demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same with announcements related to family violence. Whilst the leaving violence payments that have been announced are welcome, I know from constituents that there is slow delivery of this support. The eligibility criteria lock many people out of accessing it and it's inadequate to meet costs the actual costs incurred. Critically, the most dangerous time for victims of family violence is when they decide to leave. We need greater investment in frontline services as well as a range of other measures to stop violence before it begins.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen more funding announced for urgent care clinics; however, these are not the solution to the primary care crisis in Tasmania, particularly outside of metropolitan areas, where the urgent care clinics are located, leaving the state government to do the heavy lifting in propping up primary care in regional areas without Commonwealth support. It is not a sustainable solution to this problem in the longer term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking to aged care, the $2 billion increase only restores the cut made last year, and the new aged-care package is unfortunately unlikely to mitigate the growing waiting list, which has blown out from 30 to 90 days in 2022 to 12 to 15 months now. Just this week I had a constituent in my electorate who was approved for a level 3 package in February be advised that the waiting time for the package to be implemented is between nine and 15 months. This is unfortunately an all-too-common story. Constituents continue to wait extremely long times across a range of areas for claims to be assessed or processed. We are often able to help when we can advocate on their behalf, but I'm concerned when I think about all the people we don't hear from, who don't know where to seek help or don't have the capacity for whatever reason.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know northern Tasmanians are disappointed with this budget. There isn't enough to support the level of need that currently exists. I heard a government member today say, 'It will take a long time to fix, but we are working on it.' I say you need to work harder and faster. My community is continuing to be left behind two years after your government came to office. They are not better off as you promised them that they would be and they cannot afford to keep hanging on for some undetermined amount of time as their circumstances deteriorate. You cannot reasonably expect people to just trust you indefinitely as they feel they are getting further and further behind.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  During the school holidays I had the pleasure of hosting my first mock parliament school holiday activity. Over two sessions, we welcomed 70 enthusiastic years 4, 5 and 6 students from across Bennelong to learn about how our parliament works. These budding parliamentarians had the opportunity to role-play as MPs, debate pressing issues and gain a hands-on understanding of civic engagement and leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not everyone can make it down to Canberra for an excursion, so I held these events to ensure that everyone has access to important civics education and for them to learn a little bit about what our nation's parliament does. This event aimed to engage young students in the democratic process, educate them about the workings of government and inspire them to become active participants in their community. Through lively debates and interactive sessions, the students not only learned about the importance of civic engagement but also demonstrated their potential as future leaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During our first session, in Ermington, we kicked off the event with a very special message from you, Mr Speaker—thank you for sharing your words of wisdom with our newly appointed parliamentarians for the day. We then went into an in-depth discussion about the role of parliament and the day-to-day responsibilities of a member. The highlight of the day was undoubtedly the spirited debate surrounding a proposed piece of legislation which would have banned homework in schools. The students exhibited their exceptional critical thinking and persuasive prowess as they presented compelling arguments both in favour and against a homework ban. I can confirm that homework was banned in Bennelong, thanks to the work of the Ermington mock parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few days later we held our second mock parliament, at Ryde Public School, and it was great to welcome a bunch of other students to learn about how the parliament works. At Ryde, our debate was whether or not pineapple should be on pizza. It's truly an important debate, and one of the true culinary challenges of our time! I just want to give a shout-out to Jerome from Denistone East Public School, who was one of the local students we had the pleasure of meeting and who led the debate to ban pineapple on pizza. With a policy platform like that, and with such a cultured name, I'm sure Jerome from Denistone East is destined for great things in Bennelong!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our final activity at each event was to ask the students for issues that they wanted me to raise on their behalf in parliament. I can confirm that the kids were alright; the issues they raised are ones I deal with nearly every day. On infrastructure and transport, they want better local roads and better public transport, and they'll be pleased to know that the government has allocated nearly $25 million for Bennelong in the budget, to upgrade local roads. And the federal government will invest $115 million in a new electric-only bus depot in Macquarie Park. On education and youth activities, the kids advocated for reducing homework, more extracurricular activities at schools and cleaner school bathrooms. I will raise these issues directly with the New South Wales Minister for Education and Early Learning on their behalf. And, on environment, they wanted all levels of government to increase recycling efforts, to plant more trees and to promote electric vehicles. Thankfully, we're a government that's addressing these issues by working to establish a viable and sustainable local recycling industry, implementing our Nature Positive Plan and passing Australia's first-ever new-vehicle emission standards to encourage the uptake of lower emissions vehicles.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that our mock parliament school holiday events held in Top Ryde and Ermington were a tremendous success. It was heartening to see so many young minds actively engaged in the democratic process and offering thoughtful solutions and suggestions for our community. I'd like to thank the parents who not only enrolled the kids to be involved but also took time out of their busy days to bring their kids to these halls for a couple of hours. They were well attended, and we'll be doing them in the next school holidays. I even had one parent take the day off work to bring their kid to our school holiday event, which was really nice of them. Next time we'll trial a mock parliament targeted to older students, in years 10 to 12. I'm sure debate topics will be a bit more rigorous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to working with our local schools, parents and students as we hold more mock parliament sessions in Bennelong. I'd like to thank Ryde Public School and also the City of Parramatta council for helping us secure the space to do these and for allowing us to do these sessions on site.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  One of the great privileges of serving in this place is meeting with and visiting so many incredible organisations that support Australians across the country. I'm sure members from both sides would agree. As the shadow minister for youth, there are some amazing organisations that I've had the great pleasure of spending time with who deliver safe spaces, support and opportunities for young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most recently, I travelled to the Sunshine Coast to see my very good friend and colleague Andrew Wallace, the fabulous LNP member for Fisher, and meet with some of the youth organisations in his patch. Andrew, like me, is very passionate about ensuring young people not only have the support networks that they need but also can access opportunities no matter what their postcode. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the pleasure of starting the morning with a trip to Caloundra State High School. I want to give a shout-out to those very smart and very switched-on high school students, some of whom came into school on a student day off especially to meet with us. I thank them for coming. We had a great discussion about their concerns and thoughts about the future, their hopes and ideas and what government can do to support them. We talked about the pros and cons of social media—very topical at the moment. We talked about supporting young people and protecting young people through age verification and the need for the teaching of financial literacy for young people in high schools. They really wanted to know about spending and budgeting and how to grow a nest egg so that they could own their own property one day. They were the two biggest topics that we covered. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After that, we went to spend time with Carmel at the STEPS Pathway College, which provides independent living skills for young people with a disability. The passion and love that Carmel and her team have for those very beautiful young people they were helping to succeed and were teaching valuable life skills to was amazing to witness firsthand. What an incredible campus they have in Caloundra, with three hectares, a cafe, on-site accommodation and a garden nursery—all of which help young people at the college to develop skills so they can live a more independent life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last stop on the Fisher youth tour was to see Leon at Lookout 07. Leon is so passionate about providing a safe place for young people in the area. You can see that passion in his eyes when he's talking about it and the gym where he supports young people, and sometimes even their parents, who come along to work out, hang out, chill out and talk to someone as well. I look forward to seeing Lookout 07 grow, as I know Leon has some really big plans to support more young people in the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the way back to the Gold Coast is the Logan Youth Foyer, which I had the privilege of visiting. I would like to give a big shout-out to Malia and Percy, two young people who currently live at the foyer and were generous enough to share their very special stories and struggles with me. They were very personal, indeed, so I thank them. Youth foyers around the country provide accommodation and support for young people who are at risk of homelessness or are homeless. They do an amazing job to help the youth of our nation. So, thank you, Youth Foyer. I'm lucky enough to have one in my own electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To finish tonight I would like to talk about my own patch. This Friday and Saturday is the second IMPACT Gold Coast Youth Summit I've delivered. It's aiming to give new opportunities and networks to young people from all cultures, all identities and all abilities to connect, learn and leave inspired. We have around 200 15- to 24-year-olds living on the Gold Coast coming to attend. It's a TEDx-style event, with 20 guest speakers. I would like to thank our major partners Sea World Resort and particularly Sea World Foundation for the great work they do for conservation of marine life on the Gold Coast and Village Roadshow theme parks for their sponsorship of the event. Without them we couldn't do it. I thank Griffith University, Bond University and SCU—all Gold Coast universities—TAFE, 20 corporations, including Gold Coast Airport, Gold Coast Eisteddfod, Everybody Now, Kokoda Youth Foundation, Gold Coast rec and sport, Rotary International and all of our partners. I thank our guest speakers, including entrepreneurs, teachers, youth advocates and sportspeople. I'll give a big shout-out to Tino from the Gold Coast Titans, who is coming along to inspire the young ones. As the patron and shadow minister for youth, along with the founder and executive program director Karen Phillips, I look forward to delivering a very successful second IMPACT youth summit to support Gold Coast youth and to build a better future for all. The future is in your hands, young Gold Coasters. I'll see you on Friday and Saturday.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  With all the good things going on in so many areas, it's easy to miss the fact that the recent budget handed down by the Treasurer was very much also an education budget, and that's certainly true in Hasluck. There is a lot in the budget for TAFE and universities, but you don't get to TAFE or university straightaway. What happens at the school level is the foundation of all that follows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together with the Cook WA state Labor government, our government has agreed to fully fund all public schools in Western Australia by 2026, to 100 per cent of the school resourcing standard. In Hasluck this has been received really well by the teachers, the schools, parents and students. It will mean more resources to meet student needs across the 44 public schools in my electorate—that's 44 schools, 44 chuffed principals, thousands of grateful teachers and tens of thousands of students and parents who will benefit from this landmark deal now and into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many more exciting opportunities post school than ever before. Our vocational education sector is crucial for the green economy. There are 300,000 fee-free TAFE places in the budget over three years for students studying in areas of priority need. Plus, there's $88.8 million for an additional 20,000 fee-free TAFE places with a focus on housing and construction, with 5,000 pre-apprenticeships—that's on top of the 355,000 fee-free TAFE places we delivered last year. We have about 1,900 apprentices working towards their nationally recognised qualifications in Hasluck, and if they're in priority occupations, they will be eligible for a $5,000 incentive to help with cost-of-living pressures so they can complete their training. As well, employers in priority areas will be eligible for a $5,000 incentive to help them take the apprentices on. We are also expanding the New Energy Apprenticeship Program so that more apprentices will be eligible for the $10,000 incentive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many students want to go to university, but that can be a big step. The Albanese government is willing to back in students who back themselves, and so we have invested $350 million dollars over the next four years to provide fee-free uni-ready courses to prepare students for university study in cases where they may need bridging. The budget also sees the Commonwealth prac payment introduced for students in the field of teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work. This is such a game-changer for these sectors and for people from all backgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year I hosted a cost-of-living help hub at the Swan View Senior High School to provide advice and practical help for people in our community. Among attendees was a young nursing student whose story really resonated deeply with me. Nurses are among our most sought-after professionals in the country, yet there are significant barriers in the paths of aspiring nurses just like her. She spoke of the hurdles she faced in her nursing studies. Like all students studying their nursing degree, she has to undertake unpaid work placements that were essentially full-time commitments for weeks at a stretch. On top of this, she held a casual job to support herself through university. What struck me was the dilemma she confronted daily—after a gruelling day at the hospital, she had to decide whether to work her shifts at her casual job or risk losing those shifts because of being unavailable for many shifts in a row. Despite her passion for nursing, the financial strain caused her to contemplate quitting her studies. Fortunately for her, she had the support of her family to be able to see her through—others may not be so lucky. We should be doing everything in our power to support and encourage more people to pursue nursing careers among many of the other professions, and this is why our prac payment is such good policy. Thousands of students in Hasluck stand to benefit, and at a time when it will also help to address the cost-of-living challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On student debt, the Albanese government has listened and has made student debt fairer. The indexation applied not just this year but from now on will be the lower of the CPI or the wage price index. Because this has been backdated to June 2023, it means every person with a student debt in Australia will benefit, and in Hasluck that's about 16,500 people—16,500 people in my electorate who will be able see that their debt has reduced. That's 16,500 people better insulated from any future shocks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an education budget, and I and so many people in Hasluck are grateful for the work and foresight of Minister Clare and the Albanese government, who know that if we want to invest in the future we need to invest in our people.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:41</span>):  On Sunday, Queensland Labor Premier Steven Miles announced a six-month trial of fares of 50c per trip on all public transport. For a long time Labor politicians have been telling Queenslanders that public transport could never be free, and now they've done a near complete 180. This is a win for the Greens. It shows how we're really breaking up the status quo and raising expectations of what's possible. It shows that clearly Labor know they'll keep losing seats to us if they don't act to seriously tackle the cost of living and traffic congestion. Of course, people are right to be cynical when measures like this are announced just before a state election—measures paid for by a temporary rise in coal royalties that will soon run out, leaving Queenslanders to face the full force of the cost-of-living crisis. But why 50c when you could just make it free and eliminate the cost and inconvenience of the ticketing system? That's what the Greens are calling for, and federally for a 12-month trial of free public transport across the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public transport is already heavily subsidised by state governments. The steep fares people are paying currently only cover about 25 per cent of the operating cost of public transport. At 50c per trip, it would be cheaper to just switch off the fare machines—those expensive privatised ticketing systems. If the government's going to slash public transport fares, it needs to be to zero and it needs to be permanent. In the Greens national proposal the federal government would step in to fund the remaining 25 per cent that your ticket would normally cover. The Parliamentary Budget Office has shown that this would cost the government only $2.2 billion. This latest budget, by the way, had $50 billion in it for fossil fuel subsidies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're in a cost-of-living crisis. On top of spiking rents, mortgages and groceries, families are currently spending $100 a week—each week—filling up the car. Collectively Australians spend over $50 billion in petrol every year, but public transport is often still more expensive than driving. We can make public transport free, save families thousands a year if they switch even 25 per cent of their car trips, and help take cars off the road as well, reducing congestion and emissions. That's a win, win, win. Wouldn't it be great to see Labor pick up some of our other ideas to help Australians with the cost of living, such as freezing rents and making public schools and health care genuinely free?</span>

Constituency statements like this are an important part of our democracy because they allow elected representatives to highlight their local community in the halls of power, bringing issues of local importance to national attention. One of the great things about my community in Melbourne's north is their engagement with the world around them. They are informed, they care about others and they have an unquenchable desire to create a more just and equal world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While constituency statements typically focus on local issues, it would be remiss of me not to highlight what is happening in Gaza, in Rafah. For my community this is an issue of dire importance; it is an issue that we, as a parliament, cannot ignore. As the member for Cooper, as a long-term supporter of Palestinian liberation and as a person who believes in a just and free world, I must speak up. In the past 48 hours the Netanyahu Israeli government has unleashed a horrific bombing campaign on Rafah. Areas crowded with refugee tents have been flattened. We're seeing images of children suffering and being killed circulated on social media. More than half of Gaza's 2.3 million population have sought refuge in Rafah from the fighting elsewhere. There's simply nowhere else safe left for them to go. The death and destruction are horrific, and this human suffering is unacceptable. Hundreds, thousands in my community are rightly sharing these images to bring attention to the horrific situation in Gaza, to put all eyes on Rafah.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government and the international community have been clear about their views on the planned Israeli offensive in Rafah—that the Israeli government should not have gone down that path. We need an immediate and sustained ceasefire. Israel must comply with the binding orders of the International Court of Justice, including to enable the provision of basic services. International law must be upheld and humanitarian assistance must be allowed to flow into Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue that I feel very strongly about. It is an issue that my constituents feel very strongly about, and I am proud to speak for them here today. Together, we've been active and vocal in calling for support of civilians impacted by the war in Gaza. Together, we welcomed Australia's vote at the United Nations General Assembly to support Palestine's bid to become a full member of the organisation. Together, we have consistently called for steps towards a lasting peace in the Middle East, for the realisation of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people through statehood. My constituents are clear: this war must end.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:47</span>):  I have with me today a folder that contains 10 letters I've written to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government over the past two years. Unbelievably, I had to write to this minister seven times to even get one response. Since then she has refused to engage with me or my constituents on issues of road safety and infrastructure investment. None of the letters are political; all of the letters have been constructive and have sought information on how my community could work with the minister to deliver transport infrastructure improvements primarily related to the Princes Highway corridor. We have been ignored.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contempt shown by this minister and her department is something I've never seen in 16 years as the member for Gippsland. Basic questions about the amount of headroom remaining in the Princes Highway corridor program, progress reports on individual projects which have been waiting for more than three years to start work and how we can help identify priority projects going forward have all been ignored by this minister. Fancy that, a local MP having the audacity to write to a minister and offering some local input into strategic roadworks in his electorate! Obviously, the last thing the Canberra bureaucrats want is input from people who drive the roads of Gippsland on a daily basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This would be a joke, it would be a funny episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Utopia</span>, if it weren't so serious. People are being killed and injured on the Princes Highway while the bureaucrats and this incompetent minister sit on money that was allocated to Victoria five years ago. We heard in estimates last night that $156 million remains in the Princes Highway corridor allocation, but the hapless bureaucrats couldn't even give basic information on when projects would actually start work. Investing in better infrastructure in our regional communities, better transport infrastructure, improves connectivity for vehicles moving through the region and obviously improves safety for the local community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This minister has wasted more than 200 days on a review that she said would take 90 days and, since then, has announced that all future projects would require 50-50 funding, which is another cut for regional Victorian road projects. The state government has actually cut road maintenance funding, and the federal government is not providing any new money for capital works, so the Princes Highway is falling into a dangerous state of disrepair. After two years in office, this minister has not funded a single transport project in Gippsland to date and she can't even be bothered responding to letters on behalf of everyday Australians. It's a hopeless minister and a divided and distracted government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For clarity, prior to starting my speech today I was not aware that the previous member had more to say. There was a misunderstanding, I think, between both you and me, Deputy Speaker Payne. When you called me, she still had 10 seconds remaining. I wasn't aware that she had more to say in that speech. So I do apologise to the former speaker in relation to that misunderstanding. I thank you for giving me the call, but there was a genuine misunderstanding between me and the previous speaker.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:50</span>):  In my electorate of Tangney, a vibrant and diverse community, the high cost of living continues to put pressure on families. Amidst these challenges, however, the Albanese Labor government's budget is easing this burden across Tangney. The Albanese Labor government's tax cuts will deliver lower taxes to every taxpayer in Tangney. On average, Tangney residents will pay $1,818 less per year. Tangney residents will earn more and keep more of what they earn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Easing tax cuts are far from the only thing we are doing to ease the cost of living. Tangney is home to Murdoch University. We count many university students and graduates as an important part of our diverse community. I know the value of higher education and how it can set up a prosperous life and career. That is why I'm thrilled that the Albanese Labor government are making sure that HECS does not grow more than wages and backdating these changes to last year. In Tangney, 22,340 people will see their HECS debt wiped by at least $1,200 under these changes, providing much-needed relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last few months, I have received hundreds of emails from constituents about affordable and accessible health care. Our government is investing $2.6 billion in protecting and strengthening Medicare and keeping the price of medicine affordable. Tangney residents have saved more than $2.6 million on their medication. In the last year, residents of Tangney accessed pathology services 219,366 times. Our government is making sure that these tests stay affordable and accessible by indexing the Medicare rebates for common medical tests, reducing wait times, catching health problems sooner and ensuring common tests stay bulk-billed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">MRI scans are also so important for doctors to be able to detect and diagnose conditions like cancer, but the costs of these tests can be so high that they are out of reach for many. That is why I am proud that we are bringing five MRI machines in Tangney under Medicare coverage, expanding affordable access to crucial radiology services. Our budget is not just about providing temporary relief; it lays a foundation for long-term prosperity and wellbeing for all Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been consistent since 2020 and 2021 in what I've said. My difficulty here is very simple. I deal with the real people that come to me from right across Australia and from other members' electorates when their own member has not received their correspondence or answered their correspondence. The least they could do as members of parliament is forward their correspondence on to the minister for an answer, but to ignore them is the worst thing that they can do to these people who are crying in the wilderness for support.</span>

Raelene quite rightly told me that her daughter was not an acceptable risk or an acceptable casualty.</span>

I think he has been reasonable, giving both sides of the argument and explaining exactly what's happening in the Senate inquiry. It's reasonable, very reasonable. The first person who looked at it jumped all over Tom Burton. But I said: 'It's nothing to do with Tom Burton. He's just actually writing about what's happening in the Senate inquiry at the moment and the whole lot of submissions.' I have seen the confidential submissions to this inquiry. From those who are submitting them, the arguments are completely backed up by facts and peer reviewed processes. I suggest that everybody should take a deep breath and a good look at themselves and address themselves to what's happening in this inquiry.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:56</span>):  I rise to present a petition from Renee Evans regarding epilepsy assistance. The petition contains 1,049 signatures. It has been before the Standing Committee on Petitions and complies with the standing orders for presentation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around the world, an estimated 65 million people are living with epilepsy at any given time. In Australia alone, over 800,000 individuals will develop epilepsy in their lifetime. Epilepsy is not a new condition. In fact, it's the oldest recorded neurological disorder known to mankind. It is more prevalent than Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy combined. Yet, it struggles to receive the attention and resources it deserves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Epilepsy does not discriminate based on age. It can affect individuals of all ages, from infants to the elderly. Shockingly, the onset of seizures in people over 65 occurs almost as frequently as in children. For the elderly, seizures are often linked to underlying health issues, such as stroke or heart disease, adding another layer of complexity to their care. While epilepsy is a chronic medical condition, it is treatable for many but unfortunately not for all. Approximately 30 per cent of sufferers face uncontrolled epilepsy where treatment options are limited or ineffective. This creates immense challenges for those living with the condition and for their caregivers. Beyond the seizures themselves, epilepsy carries an increased risk of mortality, with individuals facing a risk two to three times higher than the general population. This sobering statistic underscores the critical need for better support and resources for those living with epilepsy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Behind the scenes, individuals with epilepsy face significant financial burdens. From medical appointments and transportation to dental treatments and medication, the costs add up very quickly. Sadly, government financial assistance for those expenses is limited, leaving many struggling to make ends meet. That is why I'm here today, presenting this petition for change. This petition is calling attention to those battling epilepsy and advocating for action. It is demanding the provision of healthcare cards to help alleviate the financial strain of medical costs. It is asking for increased funding to raise awareness among adults with epilepsy to ensure they receive the support and the resources that they so desperately need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that epilepsy is not just a condition; it is a life-altering reality that we cannot afford to ignore. The petition therefore asks for those affected by epilepsy to be able to obtain a healthcare card to help with some of the medical costs and for more funding to go towards raising awareness for adults suffering this debilitating condition.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">There is over 225,000 people in Australia suffering with epilepsy and very few get any financial assistance from the government with so much money spent on doctor appointments, transportation, dentist and medication we desperately need assistance for these expenses. Epilepsy is oldest neurological condition recorded and yet it is still a condition very much in the shadows while other conditions get more funding and awareness.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:59</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to stand on the floor of the parliament and offer into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> the names of eight people who have made incredible contributions to our community and who are deserving of the accolades that I wish to bestow upon them: Anne Hoitink, John Brent, Melanie Bryson, Craig Wass, Katherine Raymont, Neil Goetsch, James Geiger and Ian Harrison.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As to those names, common Australians would not have a clue as to who those people were, but they are the show presidents for the shows coming up in their respective communities, and they do an incredible job. Some of those whose names I've mentioned have been involved with their show societies for over 30 years; some of them are new. But they're all equally worthy of affirmation, and we should heap praise upon them. They don't do it for money; they're all volunteers who give their time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can tell a lot about a community by the way that the local show is conducted and by the way that the schools engage, with either their photography or their painting or their writing. You can tell a lot about the community: from those old stagers, the recidivist entrants in the fruitcake competition—which is fiercely held!—to the farmers who will put bales of hay, barley and corn, their produce, proudly on display. I never tire of the fruit and vegetable displays at the myriad of shows across the length and breadth of my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't mind sharing with the room that there was even an engineering prize at the Mudgeeraba show that was won by a member of this House, for a handbag that could be turned into a jacket. I think that you, Madam Deputy Speaker Andrews, would well know who the winner of that prize was!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's the craftwork put on by the craft associations, whether it be the quilting or the bears that they sew which end up at the hospital auxiliary afterwards. There are the cattlemen who pick out the best of their lines of cattle to send to the show, and the local stock and station agents who forgo their commission to put on a cattlemen's dinner so that the community can come together and share a meal and a few drinks the night before, to celebrate who has the best cattle in the district. There are the men's sheds who participate, with the amazing work that they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's good that we should celebrate our regional and rural shows. It's good that we acknowledge the amazing work done by volunteers in this space.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:02</span>):  On 29 April I met with the member for Tarneit, Dylan Wight, and representatives from our community-sector services in the electorate of Lalor. In attendance were representatives from Uniting Wyndham, Unison housing, Melbourne City Mission, WEstjustice, Wyndham Community and Education Centre settlement services, the Salvation Army, Wyndham City Council community services directorate, Orange Door, Anglicare and GenWest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This meeting brought together the people in my community who support our most vulnerable: those who offer emergency relief and those who work in homelessness and housing. It was an important round table with an important group of people. It gave me the opportunity to thank them for their work across the 10 years that I have been the member for Lalor but also to acknowledge the power of their local advocacy, and what they, as advocacy groups, bring to us as members of parliament—the knowledge that they bring about our local community and the community's needs and concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things—or there were several things; the conversation went for hours, obviously, with a lot of intense listening. The member for Tarneit, Dylan Wight, was able to share with them some real data coming out of state government on the Big Build and what has been constructed in the electorate of Lalor and in the city of Wyndham across the past five years to support housing and homelessness. Also, these organisations were able to bring to us some detail. One of the most compelling things they told me that day was of the increase in those having cost-of-living issues and that 60 per cent of those new people arriving for emergency relief were employed women—women with jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, this is not something that is new to government. It is one of the reasons that is driving this government to get wages moving and particularly to get wages moving in our feminised workplaces. I was pleased to be able to sit with these people and not only acknowledge the work that they do but also be able to tell them that we have a government committed to assisting them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, of course, in our budget, there were some fantastic announcements around housing, not the least of which I know they will be pleased about is the increase in rental assistance—a 25 per cent increase since we came to government. That is good news for 8,000 households in my community. I know it's good news for those who work tirelessly in this sector. I want to thank them for their work and encourage them to continue to advocate for the people of my community and the people that they represent in this place.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CALDWELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:05</span>):  Last week marked the celebration of National Volunteer Week, which is a special opportunity to highlight the invaluable contributions of volunteers within our community. Volunteering is the backbone of our community, and I extend my deepest gratitude to every person who generously dedicates their time and expertise, enriching the local community in Fadden.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another big part of National Volunteer Week is encouraging new able individuals to get involved. Recently I received a message from a local chef who was inspired by one of my Facebook posts to volunteer with Paradise Point Meals on Wheels in the hopes of supporting her community. This is an outstanding example of how one person's contribution can add so much value to organisations through sharing their skills and expertise. Meals on Wheels at Paradise Point is one of the many valuable community-run initiatives providing an important service to those who are most vulnerable. With over 7,000 dedicated volunteers, Meals on Wheels delivers a staggering 2.6 million meals across Queensland alone, reaching out to more than 19,000 individuals with diverse support needs. But Meals on Wheels, of course, offers more than just a meal. It's about the human connection, providing a vital lifeline of social interaction and companionship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm so grateful for the opportunities I've had to work with the exceptional Paradise Point team throughout the years, and I implore those who are capable to explore the realm of volunteering. As part of this year's federal volunteer grants, Paradise Point Meals on Wheels recently received $5,000 in funding towards continuing their valuable work. Other successful applicants throughout Fadden included the Animal Welfare League of Queensland, who are located at Coombabah, the Labrador Girl Guides and Pacific Pines Panthers Basketball Inc. I thank all of those and the other successful applicants for everything they do for our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the spirit of acknowledging volunteers, I want to highlight the exemplary efforts of our RSLs, community groups and schools in organising Anzac Day services across our electorate last month. This is the first time I've had an opportunity to speak about this wonderful day on our calendar. It was an honour to participate in the Anzac Day services at Helensvale, Runaway Bay and Paradise Point this year and to have representatives attend on my behalf at many others—including my wife, Lauren, who attended the Upper Coomera service, which is being held at its location in Upper Coomera for the last time before the monument is moved to allow roadworks. Special thanks go to the Runaway Bay RSL, the Northern Gold Coast RSL and the many community groups and schools who delivered this year's services. It's heartening to witness the enduring legacy of reverence for those who bravely served our nation on the battlefield being not just preserved but passionately passed down to forthcoming generations. The tradition of Anzac Day ensures that the sacrifices made by our Anzacs are not forgotten but are cherished and honoured for years to come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  At the heart of strong communities are volunteers. They are the backbone of our communities. This year's National Volunteer Week theme was 'Something for everyone', highlighting the rich diversity of volunteer opportunity, which is as prevalent as ever in my electorate of Fraser and right across our great country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I was delighted to host a morning tea for the Fraser volunteer award winners. In keeping with this year's theme, our volunteers demonstrate the diversity in volunteer talent. Michael Sposato, President of the Sunshine Heights Junior Soccer Club, won in the sports category for his almost 40 years of contribution to the soccer club. Michael is passionate about young kids in the community having a social and sporting outlet and being bonded by team camaraderie. Michael is the first person at the club every morning for training and game days, and is the last one to leave. In the community category, Gary Collins and Brenton Watson from the Sunshine RSL continuously show their support for veterans and their families, organising social events and many other supports. They work tirelessly on organising events and building up the club. They also provide connections more broadly in the community. Each year the crowds at the Anzac Day and Remembrance Day events are growing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate has a strong Vietnamese community, so it was fitting that quiet achiever Vinh Nguyen would be awarded the seniors award for his 40-year involvement with the Victorian chapter of the Vietnamese Community of Australia, as well as holding leadership positions in the Lions Club of Melbourne Vietnamese chapter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vivi Dangcong received an award in the youth category. Her passion for the arts, stemming from the Australian Vietnamese Arts group, prompted her to lead youth group projects to demonstrate to other young people how to preserve the environment through crafts and also how to preserve many aspects of Vietnamese culture. She also completed a program for young people to appreciate, promote and reconnect with their culture and the community via visual arts and dance.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last but not least was Poonam Singh, who is devoted to women's equality and founded Women of Brimbank. This organisation connects migrant women and their families through informal gatherings and larger cultural events and festivals. Poonam has been actively involved in coordinating and leading numerous programs aimed at empowering committees, particularly migrant women and survivors of domestic violence. Her volunteering work with this organisation has been ongoing for several years, demonstrating her long-term commitment to making a positive impact.</span>

This is true of Fraser and, as I mentioned before, right across Australia. Volunteer Week is an important time for us to recognise people who don't necessarily want recognition but whom it's right for us to recognise. They provide an incredible service to people in our committee who need it the most. Thank you to all of the award winners and all nominees.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  It feels like with growing frequency we hear a new story about a woman who has been killed as a result of gender based violence. We hear about her dreams and her ambitions and how her life was tragically cut short by a man, often a man that was known to her. To date this year, 31 women have been killed by men.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gendered violence has been pervasive for too long and has reached alarming levels this year. Unfortunately, we see that deaths are the very worst manifestation of gender based violence in our communities. Too many women in Australia are dying, too many women and Australia are living in fear and too many men are killing women. Enough is enough. We need investment, research and strong action to really change this. We need to be unflinching in our actions to end male violence against women. We need men to step up to call out gendered violence amongst their mates before it escalates. Gendered violence exists on a spectrum. It's not just in those final very tragic moments where people die that it manifests. It manifests in language that is used to describe women. It manifests in the undermining gender stereotypes that we see. It is the responsibility of all of us to address and confront this and do better, frankly, to combat the toxic views towards women that lead to violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to amplify the voices of victims-survivors, and I'm really pleased that the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children in a generation places the voices of victims-survivors at the heart of our strategy. I really urge people to read the introduction to that plan, which was written by victims-survivors and is an incredibly powerful piece of writing. We need to listen to victims-survivors about what they want, about what they need and about how we can drive structural and systemic change. We cannot look away anymore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we were elected, our government has put gendered violence at the front and centre of our agenda. We have a National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children in a generation, which is ambitious but is necessary, and that is supported by $2.3 billion in funding commitments. We've taken action to improve consent and support respectful relationships education, and we're incorporating all of our community in that work, which is really important. We've improved criminal justice responses to sexual violence. We've reduced trauma for victims-survivors in the criminal justice system by supporting an inquiry into justice responses to sexual violence, informed by a national roundtable and a lived-experience expert advisory group of victims-survivors and their advocates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an action plan addressing gender based violence in higher education, to address the safety of women on campus, and we're establishing a National Student Ombudsman to address sexual violence on campus too. We've invested $104.4 million in Our Watch, Australia's leader in the primary prevention of gender based violence. We've reformed the family law system so it is simpler, safer and more accessible for separating families and their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've acted to prevent and respond to sexual harassment in the workplace by implementing all recommendations in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> national inquiry report. As part of that, we've implemented a new positive duty on employers to prevent workplace sexual harassment and sex discrimination in the workplace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've invested in access to housing for women and children experiencing family violence and are continuing the Safe Places Emergency Accommodation Program, increasing crisis and emergency accommodation places for First Nations women and children, for women and children from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and for women and children with a disability. We've helped ensure women don't have to choose between their work and their safety, by introducing 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave. What is really significant about this leave is that it is available for all workers, whether they are in casual work or in permanent work. We've supported migrant and refugee women who've experienced violence by supporting visa holders further to get the support that they need, and we're investing in frontline services for women experiencing family and domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Early intervention efforts are being supported through engagement with men and boys to stop violence escalating. We're improving data reporting on domestic, family and sexual violence by establishing a new statistical dashboard to provide more timely reporting on intimate partner homicide; it will be introduced this year. We're investing in many actions to prevent and respond to technology facilitated abuse, but, clearly, there is so much work that needs to be done. We look back through decades, and see that gendered violence has been with us for a very long time. Unfortunately, it sometimes feels like things are not changing or improving in a positive way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we need to consider gender equality in all of our policies as government, because, as I've said before, it's not just those very extreme stories of women being murdered that are a manifestation of gender based violence; there are many instances that we experience in our day-to-day lives, and these are tied to gender inequality. So addressing gender inequality is really important in making sure that we eradicate gender based violence from our communities. That's why we've put gender equality at the heart of economic policy and decision-making by introducing gender-responsive budgeting and gender impact assessments as part of the Commonwealth budget process. We want women to earn more money, to be empowered and to be equal. There are many measures that we've taken in regard to that, including provisions for pay increases for workers in feminised industries. We know there's a lot more to do, and there always will be. This is a start, though.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're confronting here is intergenerational violence. Unfortunately, violence against women—gender based violence—is not new, but we see that women keep being murdered by men year after year. I want to end here by sharing some of the stories of women over decades in my electorate of Chisholm who've unfortunately been murdered due to gendered violence, because their names and their stories matter.</span>

                  <a href="300127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WATSON-BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  I thank the member for Warringah for bringing this motion. We have heard many, many fine words, with the member for Chisholm sharing some horrid stories just now. There has been genuine sentiment being expressed by the many speakers, but we need action. Women are being murdered at almost twice the rate of last year, now four a week. Just recently, the Prime Minister expressed his condolences, again, with very fine words to the families of five women murdered at Bondi Junction. Again recently, the Attorney-General said that, to create lasting change, women could not themselves be expected to solve the violence against them. But the government then released a budget that does nothing to address the epidemic of men's violence against women. That is a betrayal of women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One in four women have experienced violence since the age of 15. One in two women have experienced sexual harassment. This is absolutely an epidemic. Thirty-one women have been murdered this year. I'm sorry, but since I drafted the speech I have had to update that number twice. The government has nothing new to offer those critical front-line services in this war. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have amplified the women's safety sector's call for $1 billion each year for frontline services for over two years, and we will continue to do so until the sector is funded to do the vital work that it does. This budget was the time for the government to fully fund frontline domestic family and sexual support services, but there wasn't a single cent of new money for frontline support services, no new money for prevention programs to stop the epidemic of violence against women, no meaningful increase for JobSeeker, which would help women have the financial security to leave violence, nor was there any actual new money for crisis housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there was enough money for wealthy property investors—$174.5 billion—and enough money for fossil fuel subsidies—$50 billion. The government has offered almost nothing for women's safety, and, the more Labor ignores this national crisis, the more women will die; it's about priorities. What Labor did announce was $925 million to extend and marginally expand the existing leaving violence payment, literally a recycled Morrison government program, one that has been plagued with problems, delays and administration issues. If the Labor government were actually really serious about women's safety, it would commit to an immediate boost of $1 billion in annual funding for frontline services for domestic, family and sexual violence including crisis services, refuges and emergency housing. These are absolutely essential.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If they were actually serious they would commit to an immediate increase in funding to Legal Aid by $484 million and to Women's Legal Services Australia by $25 million to allow more women to access the legal help they desperately need. If they were serious, Labor would commit to establishing a national database to record all those who are convicted of family, domestic and sexual violence offences, and they would fund community education and prevention work consistently, including respectful relationships education, to bring about the culture change that we so desperately need in Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  I thank the member for Warringah for bringing this motion on gendered violence and acknowledge her longstanding work and advocacy in this area. There are tragic, avoidable headlines every week that confirm that gendered violence is a national crisis. The blunt statistics tell a horrific story that is worth repeating so that our nation can grasp the enormity of the problem. These are non-emotional, empirical facts: 2.3 million Australian women have experienced violence from an intimate partner. They could be your mother, your sister, your daughter, your cousin, your friend, your neighbour or even your work colleague. Yes, we all definitely know a victim-survivor of coercive control, of emotional abuse, of financial abuse, of physical violence or of sexual violence. This touches all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As of mid-May, at least 21 women have been murdered by a current or former partner. That is one women dead every four days, 21 women whose lives were ended by someone they should have been able to trust, 21 families who are left to pick up the pieces of their lives and move forward with grief and loss. And at least another 11 women have allegedly been killed this year in violent acts by men. None of us will forget the scenes from Bondi Junction in April and the horrible realisation that the deranged perpetrator was targeting women. And, while the headlines tend to focus on the number of deaths due to intimate-partner violence, let's not forget that in 2021-22 an average of 15 women per day were hospitalised because of gendered violence. Deputy Speaker, do you know how much damage is necessary to keep somebody in a hospital bed?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gendered violence is obviously a scourge on our nation. We have a lot of work to do. We know that gendered violence is not a problem that the Albanese government can solve on its own. It comes down to all of us. So today I'm going to talk to all of us. We all need to pay closer attention to our mothers, our daughters, our sisters, our cousins, our friends and our colleagues for the signs that it might be happening—happening to women, to young teenagers, to the people we know and love. It's not always obvious by any means, but there are some indications that if a woman has been assaulted once by an intimate partner she is likely to be assaulted again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Canadians have come up with a domestic assault risk assessment. It's a questionnaire administered by professionals and used to determine the likelihood that a perpetrator will offend again. Some of the questions rely on police evidence, such as prior criminal convictions for domestic assaults or a prior non-domestic assault conviction. However, many of the indicators are things we would know about the women in our lives—some details revealed in their cry for help, perhaps, be that cry explicit or subconscious. The indicators for us to consider include: Does she have more than one child, or does she have a child from a previous partner? Did he assault her when she was pregnant? Has he been violent before? Does he have two or more indicators of substance abuse? Is she worried about future assaults, or has her partner threatened to kill her? Is it hard for her to access victim support services? This is part of the chilling checklist used, and the more questions that are answered with yes, the more likely he is to do it again and perhaps to escalate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are numerous other behavioural indicators that can point to a woman you know experiencing domestic violence. And, before people contact my office with 'not all men'-erisms, I assure you that this is by no means an exhaustive list. It's important to be aware that, if she seems afraid of her partner or is anxious to please him, if she doesn't see much of her friends or family or when she is away from him she is continually contacted by him, if her partner puts her down publicly, if he controls her access to money, if she seems frightened or—the obvious one—if she has mysterious bruises, it's not often that the situation goes away. In many cases, the woman does not know where to turn to for help or is too afraid to. We need to be brave in supporting women, which means having those confronting conversations. These are not easy subjects to broach. But respectful and supportive conversations, starting with a question like, 'Is everything okay? I have noticed—' inserting what you've noticed, could be the start of a journey away from control and violence to safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Taking a step away from the personal level, we need to focus on government and systems to support both victims-survivors of gendered violence and the urgent action that the nation needs to do on prevention. That's why the recent Labor budget included substantial funding to provide direct support to women and children fleeing violence. Labor has made the Leaving Violence Program permanent, ensuring financial support and support services for up to 12 weeks. The budget included a range of other measures too. We're investing $1 billion in social housing for young people, women and children fleeing violence. We're rolling out an education program on consent and respectful relationships, trying to change that culture. We've convened a rapid review of how best to prevent violence against women. This will be driven by Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commissioner, Micaela Cronin, and will seek the feedback of experts in the field.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor remains focused on our goal to end violence against women and children in one generation. In October 2022, in partnership with state and territory governments, we released the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children. A key focus is on addressing the underlying factors that drive violence against women and children. The goals are to prevent violence before it occurs, to intervene early and to prevent escalation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would encourage everyone to read Jess Hill and Michael Salter's work <span style="font-style:italic;">Rethinking primary prevention</span>. In this piece, they set out four priorities. The first of these is accountability and consequences for perpetrators. This could include proactive work to locate high-risk and known offenders and ensure DV orders are being implemented. It could also include banks suspending the accounts of men who are financially abusing their intimate partners. Secondly, they outline the effects of intergenerational trauma, child neglect and child abuse, both for potential perpetrators and for potential victims. To quote from their article:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Child abuse and neglect—including growing up with coercive control, being physically or sexually abused, being shamed and/or neglected by parents—are accelerants to adult victimisation and perpetration. Traumatised and abused girls who are not supported to recover and heal are more likely to be targeted by violent and controlling perpetrators throughout their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their childhood trauma:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… often has the effect of normalising grooming and maltreatment and blinding them to 'red flags' and boundary violations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so the cycle repeats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, traumatized boys are disproportionately at risk of becoming perpetrators of gender-based violence, and other forms of criminal behaviour—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">trapped by their own history. It's obvious we need to work with victims-survivors and perpetrators and those at risk to break these vicious cycles. Hill and Salter stress the vital importance of supporting women and children economically. Lastly, they highlight the external commercial factors that can lead to gendered violence. This is the role of alcohol, pornography and gambling. All exacerbate gendered violence. Gendered violence is a multifaceted problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, the work needs to be done at a personal as well as a government level. Labor has provided $2.3 billion of funding for programs that focus on consent, respectful relationships and sexual violence prevention. This includes $100 million over five years for the crucial work of Our Watch, the leading body for the primary prevention of violence against women and children in Australia. Organisations in the states and territories which support women experiencing violence have benefited from an additional $159 million to deliver their vital frontline services—funding that was due to cease next month. We're addressing the workplace shortages and steadily growing the number of vital frontline workers. Another initiative with an immediate positive impact for women dealing with violence is the ability to access 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave from their workplaces, whether they're permanent or casual. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is also undertaking ongoing systemic work. We're strengthening the way the criminal justice system responds to sexual assault. The Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry is currently underway on this topic. We're committed to strengthening and harmonising sexual assault and consent laws and improving both the experience and outcomes for victims-survivors in the justice system. I'd like to thank the lived-experience expert advisory group on the inquiry for their bravery and advocacy. Lord knows we've seen too many horror stories with links to this workplace play out in the media lately. We must do better by our brave victims-survivors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gendered violence affects women of every age, cultural background, level of education and job, in every community across our country. Ninety-one per cent of Australians recognise that gendered violence is a problem—that's good—but only 47 per cent think it's a problem in their community. It's happening everywhere, and we all need to address it. We all have the responsibility to resolve it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion brought by the member for Warringah, and I thank the member for bringing this motion which concerns gendered violence. The motion has been brought particularly in light of some of the more heinous events that we've seen recently throughout our country and in my home state of New South Wales, where women who have taken out numerous AVOs, who have done everything we have asked them to do, have still been violently murdered at the hands of an ex-partner. The motion notes that one woman every four days in Australia is murdered by her current or former partner—one woman every four days. It's horrific. The statistics are absolutely horrific. These are, of course, the ones that we know about. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had the privilege of being in this place now for two years, and in just those two years we've dealt with many issues of national significance—defence, health, appropriations, how Australians are taxed, the environment, energy, housing, immigration. These are big issues, but I think that domestic violence and how to tackle it is probably the most overwhelming of our national problems. It is a crisis. When I've spoken to colleagues, both male and female, about this, the most commonly uttered word is 'overwhelming'. That's how I feel. I feel overwhelmed by this as well. But if we can't speak in this place about this very important issue then there is no way that we can ever find solutions for it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place we have debates. We have disagreements. We've come here from a range of different backgrounds and a range of different experiences. In having heard many of the speakers on this motion—and I thank all of them for having spoken on it—we've heard about lived experience of domestic violence. We've heard about members whose direct family members have been impacted. Many have been impacted themselves. They may have worked in the community sector. They may have, as with the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Cowper, worked as police officers early in their lives, assisting women and children, dealing with the perpetrators and enforcing AVO's. If we have not been directly impacted ourselves, I and I'm sure most of the members in this place have heard horrific stories from our electorates from women desperate for a safe home, desperate for a court to prevent her ex-partner finding her, desperate to ensure the safety of her children, desperate for the violence and the abuse to stop. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also hear from frontline workers on the ground, running organisations, trying to help pick up the pieces—underresourced, overstretched and overworked. I have many of these excellent community service organisations in my electorate. I'm lucky; I'm in a metropolitan area, and I know that many of these organisations are simply not available in our regional areas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was first elected I met with the two superintendents of the local area commands in my electorate—Sutherland and Liverpool. When asked what the major challenge that they face in their LAC was, they both unhesitatingly said domestic violence. When we say 'domestic violence', we're covering a lot of things. We're covering physical violence, sexual violence, emotional abuse, financial abuse and technology enabled abuse, and they all have different manifestations and different impacts on victims. We talk a lot about victims.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms WARE:</span>
                  </a>  This motion talks about providing significantly more money for victims, for example, in a whole range of areas. It also talks about providing more money for education. It talks about better resourcing of frontline workers. All of those measures are supported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has been particularly important with this motion is the number of male MPs who have spoken on this. This is not a woman's issue. This is a community issue. It's a whole-of-society issue. It's a problem for all of us in this place. We—men and women—need to work together to come up with solutions. I think it's also very important to remember that these crimes are committed by a small minority of men. Most Australian men do not hit women. They do not abuse women. They find it abhorrent. For years now, since we broke the taboo of silence and the taboo on victims speaking out about domestic violence, we have sought improvements in many spaces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said before, we've introduced AVOs. We've put significant resources into policing and training police officers in the domestic violence arena. We've done this through the courts. We've done it through welfare agencies and through our education system. But many of the most recent alleged perpetrators, for example, were under the age of 35, so they had in fact already been through an education system that has embedded respectful relationships within its curriculum from preschool.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the victims go and apply for an AVO. An AVO, though, provides no shield against a gun. An AVO provides no shield against a knife. An AVO provides no shield against a perpetrator following his victim, online or otherwise, without her knowledge. An AVO provides no shield against a perpetrator convinced that a woman is his possession, that she has no right to leave him and that she or her children must be punished by violence or even death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I do support this motion that speaks about providing more assistance to victims, I think we now also need to have a conversation and look at measures that have worked, both here and overseas, in prevention, early intervention and rehabilitation. We need to consider that the perpetrators in these cases have mental health issues, because it is not normal for people to be violent. It is not normal for men to hit women. We need to look at diversionary programs that address underlying anger-management issues, for example. That is the only way that we are going to break this cycle. We can continue to provide more and more money for victims, and that is important. But until we stop violent men hitting women, this cycle will continue. We will continue to see more women dying, and we'll continue to see more women trying to find safe haven in refuges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Cowper spoke quite compellingly about the success that he had seen in some areas of his electorate when he was a young police officer in diversionary programs, in male education programs and rehabilitation—to the extent that he actually saw that some of these offenders recognised that their behaviour had been completely unacceptable and had ended up leading classes in diversionary and male re-education programs. We need to take on board comments such as that. We need to take on board the lessons over in California, for example. The criminal justice system set up a domestic violence diversion program similarly aimed at intervention, rehabilitation and education. It has similarly seen some success.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gender violence is multifaceted. It is a very complex issue. As I said, it feels overwhelming in its scope. I feel confident though that, at least in this place, we are all trying to work together to find solutions for this problem. Einstein famously said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing the same way it has always been done and expecting a different outcome. Now is the time we need to throw everything at this problem. We need to put everything on the table and we need to look at how we can change the behaviour of perpetrators as well as providing adequate support for victims.</span>

This year in Australia more than 30 women have been murdered through gender based violence. Half of those women have been in regional parts of our country. Devastatingly, that's an average of two women killed every week. These are truly shocking statistics.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr GEE:</span>
                  </a>  As I was noting before the division, one of the things that the member for Warringah's motion calls for is more support for the legal services that support women in our community, and, as a member of the New South Wales bar, I've seen the devastating impact that domestic violence has on victims and also the real difference that legal support can make to the lives of victims. Legal support can be absolutely crucial in making that difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to focus, in the time available to me today, on drawing the attention of the House to the crucial need to bolster legal services for victims of gender based and domestic violence in our communities. I had some correspondence from Jarah Maraschio, who is a family law and violence solicitor from Western Women's Legal Support in Dubbo. The letter that I received from Jarah stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Every day, my colleagues and I witness the devastating impact of domestic and sexual violence on women's lives. We meet survivors who have been failed by the very systems designed to protect them—the courts, the police and their partners. The death of Molly Ticehurst serves as a grim reminder of the urgent need for comprehensive legal assistance, safety planning, advocacy, and support for women in rural and regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">However, despite steadfast dedication, Western Women's Legal Support faces significant challenges in fulfilling its mission. With only nine staff numbers, most of whom work part-time, and covering a vast geographic area comparable to the size of Korea, the organisation's resources are stretched thin. It operates on a tight budget, unable to afford essential expansions to office space or additional staff to meet the growing demand for its services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The funding shortfall we face is not merely a financial issue; it is a matter of life and death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also sent some case studies which highlight the vitally important work that organisations such as Western Women's Legal Support undertake. One of the case studies that I was forwarded involves the case of Ms S, who was referred to the Western Women's Legal Support service through a local primary school in 2019:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ms S had been married to the offender for 10 years …and they had 2 children together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They had moved to Australia from overseas. The case study continues:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">During Ms S's time in Australia she had been made to stay at home at all times (other than to take the children to school) and instructed not to speak to anyone. Consequently, her English was poor. Parties rented two rooms in a share house of foreign workers. Ms S and the children were confined to the bedroom. She was not permitted to use electricity at the property and spent her days washing clothes by hand and cooking outside on the BBQ.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ms S was not allowed access to money. She was not permitted to go shopping or anywhere alone. On the rare occasion she was permitted to grocery shop with her husband she was not allowed to touch anything or request anything be purchased for her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Over the course of numerous appointments with Ms S she disclosed some of the most horrific physical, emotional, mental, sexual, financial and psychological abuse our unit has ever encountered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ms S had numerous legal and non-legal issues. With the permission of Ms S we engaged numerous legal services and coordinated Ms S and the children's ultimate removal from the property and away from her husband.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The case study goes on to reveal that Ms S ultimately went to police, with the support of the legal service, and made a statement, and the offender was criminally charged as a result of the abuse. The case study continues:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our lawyers and caseworkers assisted with housing applications, Centrelink matters, child support exemptions, an additional application for victims support for the sexual abuse (distinct from the DV). We provided assistance with court prep and court support and advised Ms S in relation to family law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting Ms S out of that situation took a lot of planning and a lot of work, and it was no doubt a very harrowing experience for everyone involved in that. The case study goes on to state:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ms S's story took the dedication and collaboration of legal services, casework services, housing providers, DV refuge staff, Police and various Government agencies all working together. This case, whilst ultimately a positive one, really demonstrates how one service working in isolation cannot wholly support victim survivors and their multiple complex needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is from Western Women's Legal Support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also heard from other organisations in the region—the Central Tablelands and Blue Mountains Community Legal Centre, Yoorana Gunya Family Healing Centre Aboriginal Corporation and Binaal Billa. They have stated that urgent support for frontline legal services, community services and refuges is absolutely vital. Taylor Bliss from Yoorana Gunya Family Healing Centre Aboriginal Corporation and Binaal Billa Family Violence Prevention Legal Services in Forbes expressed the profound impact of such systemic failures, stating: 'The death of Molly in our small town is devastating. The legal system continues to let women down. How many more victims need to die before there is change to the justice system?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Arlia Fleming, who is a solicitor and chief executive officer of the Central Tablelands and Blue Mountains Community Legal Centre, said: 'As legal service providers for victims-survivors, we often find ourselves grappling with the challenge of ensuring safety. With refuges at full capacity, limited police intervention and insufficient community resources to provide support for women and children or hold perpetrators accountable, the options are severely limited.' Ms Fleming went on to state: 'Without adequate resources we are unable to meet the increasing demand for our services, leaving many disadvantaged individuals and families without the support they desperately need.' She said: 'We already have a consistent three-week waitlist. Without access to our services, victims-survivors may be forced to remain in unsafe environments. Furthermore, without early intervention and support, the long-term social and economic costs of domestic and family violence will continue to escalate.' Importantly, she also stated: 'We implore government stakeholders at all levels to recognise the urgency of this situation and prioritise funding for frontline services like ours.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have said it more eloquently than I could, but the message is clear: more resources are needed for those frontline services, including frontline legal services. It can make a real difference to the lives of victims and also their children. We need to act. All over the Central West we have seen a huge outpouring of support for immediate action on gender based violence and domestic violence. The message from across Australia could not be clearer. I implore all members of this parliament to do whatever they can to get more funding to the front lines where it's needed and take action so that we can finally put an end to this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the member for Warringah for bringing this motion to the House. This has to be an ongoing and sustained effort. I implore all members, from whatever party, to take action in their communities and in this place to end gender based violence.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  Grieving father Tony Ticehurst told the 2 May funeral for his daughter Molly, 'Every parent would like to see their child change the world, but not at this cost.' Tony always had an inkling that his daughter Molly would be somebody who would change the world. But her death, allegedly at the hands of a partner, on 22 April not only stopped Forbes, the wider central western region of New South Wales and the state but also the nation. It stopped people in their tracks and made them realise that much more needs to be done. It shocked the nation. Molly's funeral, at the local rugby field, was attended by Premier Chris Minns, and I commend him for the fact that he was at the service just a day after his father's death. That's leadership. The funeral was attended by senior police, and I know we have former senior police in this parliament. One sits right behind me—the member for Wide Bay. In my own party, the Nationals, our colleague the member for Cowper was a police officer, as was the opposition leader. Any police officer who has served any given time has been to far too many domestic violence incidents—in fact, attending one domestic violence incident is one too many.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Molly's tragic death at age 28 has brought home to many that enough is enough. There cannot be any more silence about domestic violence. At her funeral a small card was handed out in lieu of a service booklet, and it had her beautiful picture on it; her date of birth, 12th of the fourth 1996; and the date of her tragic death, 22nd of the fourth 2024.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, her friends and family have Molly in their hearts, but we need to, as a parliament and as a nation, have her foremost in our conscience and in our thoughts, and have Molly's memory as a driving force to do better. Men have to be better. Men have to end this gendered violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Wagga Wagga recently had a vigil—a rally of sorts, although it was more of a coming together of our community to say, 'We are not going to accept this any longer.' It wasn't a protest by any means, but one of the most passionate speakers at that vigil was Johanna Elms. She heads up the Wagga Women's Health Centre. She spoke with clarity, she spoke eloquently and she spoke with passion. There was fire in her voice because she is very worried about the fact that they are seeing too many women seeking counselling and support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that the government have addressed their 12-month funding gap. The centre was not promised funding of $200,000 through the primary health network, and they were worried. I'm pleased that I, with the government, was able to provide that extended assistance for another 12 months, but it still leaves instability in the future of this vital service, and it doesn't address the three- to six-month waiting list for counselling services. In the long term, increased and ongoing funding is absolutely necessary to ensure that adequate support is available for women and their children in the Riverina when and where they most need it. It's a growing need. The Wagga Women's Health Centre has been going since the 1970s. It has decades of experience in frontline support, counselling and services. When Johanna Elms speaks, our community does—and should always—listen. Similarly, the CatholicCare Wilcannia-Forbes, which does so much vital and important work throughout the Central West, was unable to access funding through the state government, and I would impress upon anybody who has the ear of the state government that that is a vital service doing vital work and it needs every bit of government support that it can get.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased with the measures that were announced in the budget, and I acknowledge the government for that. Anything that can help and build on the work that we did as a government is to be applauded, but more needs to be done. I do note that the $925 million of support has been rebadged. The coalition called it 'escaping violence'; Labor is calling it the 'Leaving Violence Program'. I do hope that money is not going to be drained in the areas of rebadging, graphic design et cetera, because name changes mean nothing. It's the action on the ground that we need to see money being spent on. To that end, I commend and thank CatholicCare Wilcannia-Forbes and I also applaud the work being done by the Wagga Women's Health Centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The memory of what happened to Molly Ticehurst and other women who lost their lives far too young is an abomination. The deaths of those women is an abomination on our nation. It should strike a chord in every one of us and lead us to all know that more needs to be done. Funding is absolutely commended and worthwhile, and men can, should and must—must—do better.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  In a month's time, 13½ million Australians will be paying less tax in every pay packet because of this Albanese government. In Macquarie that means 67,000 people will see more money in their pocket when they get their pay packet. For a worker on the average wage of $73,000, that's a tax cut of $1,500 per year. For a family on the average household income of $130,000, it's a tax cut of $2,600. This is money that will be directly in people's pockets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eighty-four per cent of taxpayers and 90 per cent of women will be getting a bigger tax cut because of the changes that are in the legislation in this budget, including, of course, nearly three million Australians who were going to miss out completely on getting any sort of cut under the previous tax regime—those who were on less than $45,000. They weren't going to get a single cent under the Liberals. But now they will, like everybody else, be better off because they will have a cut to the tax that they pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tax cuts are better for women, they're better for part-time workers, they're better for young people and they're better, also, for businesses and for workforce participation. In a month, along with that tax cut for every single taxpayer, there's going to be energy price relief for every single household, with $300 off the power bill for every home in Australia, and money to support small businesses as well with their power costs so that their bill is reduced. The way we're doing this means that inflation will also be cut at the same time as we're helping people. We know that this has very wide economic benefits as a consequence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to homes, there's also $32 billion that we're investing in more social housing, more public housing, more affordable housing and more construction. There are incentives for people to build more homes so that they can be rented. There's funding for the urgent works that are required by state governments so that you can do residential construction. These are things that are encapsulated in this budget, which is a commitment to tackling the issues of the cost of living, housing and many others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to break down some of the initiatives in our budget. I'm going to start by talking about women and how our budget helps women. Let's talk about women's safety. This budget includes key financial commitments that go alongside the package of work that we're doing to ensure that women and their children are able to be safer. There's nearly $1 billion over five years for the permanent Leaving Violence Program to help women who need financial support to escape. There's around $44 million to provide an immediate funding boost to the legal assistance sector. That includes the community legal centres in my electorate who provide extraordinary support for women. I know how stretched they are, and we know that this is just the start of getting the support that's needed into that sector. This budget provides a boost until the national partnership is renegotiated and comes into effect from 1 July 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also nearly $40 million to eradicate gender based violence from universities. That sits alongside a whole range of women's safety initiatives. For instance, in the meantime, as a whole lot of work is being done, Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety is being funded to further build the evidence base on pathways into and out of the perpetration of family, domestic and sexual violence. That is taking place at the same time as our rapid review of targeted prevention approaches to violence against women. All of these are being funded in this budget. These investments build on the $2.3 billion already in place to support women's safety and deliver the national plan. It's a huge important step for women's and children's safety. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also directs $1 billion towards social housing for women and children fleeing violence, and to young people, which goes to the next tranche of measures that are important for women's security—that is, investment in women's economic equality and financial independence. This budget includes initiatives in that area. For a start, more than $1 billion over four years has been set aside to pay superannuation on government funded paid parental leave for parents of babies born or adopted from 1 July next year. That means women won't go backwards with their superannuation. It's a huge long-wanted step, and of course only a Labor government will deliver it. There's also nearly $2 billion over five years for social housing, because we recognise that many women are in social housing or are supported in their housing. I include this one here, in terms of security, because housing security is at the core of being safe. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been around a 40 per cent increase in the maximum rates of government rent assistance since we came to government. About half the people who benefit from that are single parents, and the vast majority of those are women. So that's tangible support for women. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also providing financial support to the women who are students who do mandatory nursing, midwifery, social work or teaching placements. They'll be supported. This budget allocates the funds to ensure that they can be supported while they're doing their mandatory prac teaching. They will be able to survive and finish their course thanks to this support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've set aside funding in anticipation of the final decision of the Fair Work Commission on wages for aged-care workers—again, a highly feminised industry. That builds on the $11 billion increase that has already been provided for the wage increases that have been granted. We have also set aside funding for the wage increase for early childhood education and care workers once the details are finalised by the Fair Work Commission. Again, it is a highly feminised industry, and these things give women greater financial security. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also creating more training and job opportunities for women, including, for instance, $55 million over the next four years for a Building Women's Careers Program, to drive industry change and boost the number of women in high-paying careers in the construction, clean-energy, tech and advanced manufacturing workforce. We want to see women's participation increase, and everything we've done in government, including in this budget, speaks to that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women's health is absolutely crucial to their engagement in the workforce and their ability to be there for their families and to participate in our society. There is a dedicated $56.1 million women's health package in this budget. Let's look at some of the things that are there. A huge amount of it—nearly $50 million—is to introduce longer consultation items for patients with complex gynaecological conditions such as suspected endometriosis and PCOS but also many other conditions. That means that GPs will be funded to spend more time with women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's $3½ million over four years to expand indemnity insurance for privately practising midwives. I know in my community, particularly in the Blue Mountains, this will be a much welcomed investment. There's funding to support women and their families who've suffered miscarriage and pregnancy loss. There's funding for participating maternity services and First Nations communities to help prevent pre-term and early-term birth. There's funding to collect better data on miscarriages and on sexual and reproductive health—all things that were largely ignored by the previous government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also around $5 million to support the placement costs for health professionals to undertake training to support access to long-acting reversible contraceptives—another really significant women's health initiative. And there's $1 million to develop an interactive contraception decision tree to help women and their health professionals work through their best options. There will be $12 million for the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation to provide free period products, and $6 million for four years of outreach health care in crisis accommodation to support women and children who are experiencing family, domestic and sexual violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I have to put this one in: $1.2 million to support placements for health professionals to enrol in the professional development accredited course 'Managing menopause'. All these are things that have been previously ignored but make a profound difference to women. They come on top of initiatives we've introduced already, things like the endometriosis clinic that is available and close to my community in Rouse Hill. Women are winners in this budget. It's a budget for everybody and, for the first time in many years, I can see that, more than anybody, women are the winners here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people have also been placed at the centre of our decision-making. When I say 'decision-making', when we make decisions about what the priorities are and where the funding goes, it is so crucial to think about those who are coming up behind us, not just those in my position and of my generation. Every young person will get a tax cut. Every household that a young person is living in, whether they're renting on their own or whether they're in the very early stages of owning their own home, will receive support and relief from their energy bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to talk about those numbers. Around 1½ million taxpayers are aged 18 to 24. They're going to receive, on average, $1,000 from their tax bill. Around 1.6 million are in the 25 to 29 age bracket. They'll receive, on average, around $1,573 from their tax bill. We also know that for young people carrying a HECS debt or a HELP debt, it is another financial thing that weighs them down—I certainly see it with my own children who, quite frankly, are just outside that youth category now that they've hit their 30s. However, the relief in the HELP system to make it fairer for people carrying a student debt is immeasurable. We know that the wiping of around $3 billion off that HELP debt will help more than three million Australians. In Macquarie, around 16,225 people will benefit from the lightening of that HELP debt load. It is also young people who will benefit from the prac payments. It supports their teaching, nursing, social work, university placements. Around 73,000 eligible students are going to benefit across the board. For the young people I speak to, it's a huge relief to know that someone is listening to the challenges that they face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For other young people, the key to getting into university is going to be the $350 million that is being delivered for the fee-free uni-ready courses, to prepare them for university and open up that pathway. Others will benefit from the New Energy Apprenticeships Program so that more apprentices can receive up to $10,000 to be in those apprenticeships of the future, which we need to be working on now. In parts of the Hawkesbury, where there's a very high desire to go to TAFE, lots of families will look at that and say: 'Great. Here's a licence to go into that part of the TAFE system.' The expansion of that program, which comes into effect in just a couple of days time, means more clean energy apprentices can be in training to support that transition to net zero. Right now, there are around 2,085 apprentices in Macquarie. I look forward to that number rising. Training more tradies and construction workers to build more homes is going to benefit not just the workers who are working there but also the generation that really needs to see us boosting the housing supply. Our $32 billion of investment in housing is going to see them be the winners. There's funding for live music and for the arts—all of those things. Our investment in mental health will make things better for our young people.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="247742" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOWARTH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2024-2025 and related bills, and on what Labor has delivered in this budget. The reality is that for the people of Petrie there's very little in this budget that the government can be proud of. In the last two years, this government has seen people's cost of living rise and their finances fall through the floor, with rents up, mortgages up and homelessness up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government crow about tax cuts, but what they've done with tax cuts is basically legislate bracket creep for literally a million Australians around the country. The government would not be doing anything on income tax cuts if it weren't for the former coalition government delivering stage 1 and 2 tax cuts and legislating stage 3 tax cuts. Prime Minister Albanese promised not to change the legislation then broke his word and changed it. He has inserted the 37 per cent tax rate back into legislation. The coalition had killed bracket creep by making and legislating 30c in the dollar for incomes between $45,000 and $200,000. The Prime Minister said he wouldn't change that, saying, 'My word is my bond.' He has changed it. He's now put in the 37 per cent tax rate for incomes above $135,000. That's clearly a broken promise, and that's just one; he's done the same on superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He's done the same on electricity bills by throwing $300 around. A one-off payment of $300 is an absolute joke when most bills around Australia have gone up by $1,000 in the last two years. As the member next to me would know, the state Labor government has promised $1,000. It makes this government look absolutely lousy, with a lousy $300. Queenslanders woke up saying: 'Hang on. The state Labor government's giving $1,000, and the federal government wants to give $300. How lousy can you get?' In the next three years after that you get a one-off payment, but in years 2, 3 and 4 you're hit with higher electricity bills. That's since this government's come in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear that people in my electorate will receive tax cuts from 1 July. The coalition voted twice for that—previously, when we were in government, and now. Let it be known that if it weren't for the coalition there would be no tax cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's little for housing. We're in the middle of a housing and homelessness crisis. Rents have been up for the last two years. Mortgages have gone up 12 times in the last two years. Homelessness levels are through the roof—and this is after, according to the last census, the coalition government reduced rough sleeping around the country. There isn't a place in this country that you can go to now where you won't see more tents, more people sleeping in cars and more people sleeping in swags since the Albanese Labor government was elected. If they don't get their act together by 2026, if they're still in government, homelessness will be through the roof, and it rests squarely with Labor and the Greens party in the Senate. There's no-one else to blame. Labor is in federally. Labor is in in every state on the mainland. There's no-one else to blame.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the Commonwealth rent assistance increase by the government, but I would say that rents in the last two years have increased by more than the Commonwealth rent assistance payment to people on welfare. I'd also say that there is pretty much nothing for infrastructure in my electorate that wasn't promised under the previous coalition government. Queensland senators from the Labor Party are quick to open the projects that we announced, but there's no new money. There's nothing to improve communities for all those volunteers, those sporting community groups and those jobs that go along with the infrastructure needed. At the last election, I secured $25 million in election commitments from the former Prime Minister. Do you know how much the Labor Party promised? Nothing—absolutely zero for Petrie. The electorate is completely missing out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've engaged with the Prime Minister. I've always treated the Prime Minister respectfully. I've walked up to him and said: 'Prime Minister, here's a list of Petrie projects that need funding that will help my community. Could you please consider it?' I did it for last year's budget. There was nothing last year and nothing this year. These are projects like a high performance centre for the NRL Dolphins that would benefit Redcliffe high and other programs in the area. There's nothing for Redcliffe Tigers Australian Rules Club for women's change rooms. There's nothing for the Aspley Bowls Club to help people get out of the sun with a safe outdoor exercise area. There's nothing for the Redcliffe Leagues Softball from the Albanese Labor government. There's nothing for new lighting for the Peninsula Power Football Club, one of the best soccer clubs in Australia outside the A League. There's nothing for women's change rooms for the Aspley Hornets AFL Club in the southern end of my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government says they're doing a lot for women, but in the last two years we've seen more women and more partners—men as well, but a lot more women—having to go back to work. Why? Their cost of living's through the roof. This is the problem. They won't even fund women's change rooms at the Aspley Hornets AFL Club. I've got the sports minister in the seat next door in the seat of Lilley. There's nothing. They're missing in action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll continue to raise these issues to make sure that Petrie gets their fair share, but under this government they're not getting anything. There's also the Bald Hills Memorial Hall, where we need a toilet upgrade. That's a very important hall. It was an ANZAC hall, built after World War 1. There were masses of people down there for ANZAC Day, which I was at again this year. We needed $350k from the Albanese government to upgrade there. We got nothing. We got nothing for the lighting renewal for Langdon Park, which is used by Redcliffe Little Athletics. We needed $80,000 for Burpengary and District Men's Shed to install a new shed for a rapidly growing area where there are retired and other men. It helps with their mental health to get together and use their hands. We got nothing for them. We needed $5 million for the Singh Sabha Brisbane community centre. This is an area down in Taigum, on the border of my electorate, where people meet seven days a week, from dusk to dawn. The community needs some new facilities there. There was nothing for them either. The list goes on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke about roads yesterday. Six years ago the former coalition government put in 80 per cent of the funding to upgrade much needed roads in Griffin and Murrumba Downs. The people of Griffin in my electorate will know that when we get heavy floods or heavy rain in Queensland—and we've had a lot since Christmas 2023—Dohles Rocks Road completely floods. The former coalition government, the Liberal-National government, was able to invest with the Moreton Bay Regional Council to upgrade Henry Road, but a lot more needs to be done on Dohles Rocks Road. The Albanese Labor government has delivered nothing there. Six years ago, I got 80 per cent of the funding to do the on and off ramps at Griffin and Murrumba Downs as well. This was in Premier Steven Miles's electorate. What's happened in the last six years? Nothing. They couldn't get that done either. Four months out from a state election in Queensland, all of a sudden they're like, 'Let's get Linkfield Road going, or maybe we can get the on and off ramps happening.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's too little, too late. It should have been done 10 years ago. It should have been done eight years ago. It should have been done six years ago, when the former coalition government funded 80 per cent of these projects. They did absolutely nothing. That's because the Premier is a partisan premier when it comes to politics. If there's a good idea from the coalition, he'll say, 'No, we can't support that.' I've never met another state member like him. I got $2 million to build a new pool at the Mango Hill State Secondary College, and this bloke got Grace Grace to cancel that project. I had to give the money to the Lakes College, at North Lakes, who were welcome to receive the funding. They've got a new pool there—it's got eight lanes and is 25 metres long—at the North Lakes and Mango Hill swimming club. But this is what it means when you have Labor members that are partisan: nothing gets built.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say to the people of Griffin that I won't be letting this go. Dohles Rocks Road will be upgraded. Murrumba Downs and Griffin on and off ramps will be done, and whilst I'm your federal member I'll keep raising it in parliament. If we have to elect an LNP state government in October, under the leadership of David Crisafulli, to get it built, that's what we need to do. I also got 80 per cent of the funding for the Gateway Motorway between Bracken Ridge and the Pine River. That was six years ago; I got $800 million ready to go. Do you think the Palaszczuk and Miles governments could deliver that? No—absolutely nothing.</span>

                    </a>  You're right, Member for Bradfield. It's no good. The current transport minister, Minister King, also put a review on all these projects, which delayed the projects further in the last two years. Now they have capped that funding. What's happened in the last six years and after COVID? Everything has gone up. Projects that were funded previously, like the upgrade on the Gateway Motorway, which was worth about a billion dollars and to which we committed $800 million, will now probably cost $1½ billion to build. This is really important because the people of Griffin, the people of North Lakes, the people of Mango Hill, the people of Deception Bay and the people of Burpengary East who are coming down the Bruce Highway to work in the morning get stuck there in that intersection. Once again, it looks like we'll need to elect an LNP state government to get this flowing. The federal government can provide a lot of the money, but, if the state government—through their transport and main roads—won't get it started, we need a change in government. That's been a real issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget, too, there is no new funding for psychologists, to make sure that the Medicare subsidised mental health treatment plan got restored from 10 visits back up to 20. It was 20 under the coalition government. The Albanese government, under Minister Butler, has cut that down to 10 Medicare subsidised services. Just last week, I was contacted by Katherine in North Lakes, who has been seeking mental health treatment through the Medicare subsidised program. She has almost reached her 10 sessions, she's happy with how her psychology sessions are going and she wants the Albanese government to re-establish those 20 sessions. So I wrote to Minister Butler to assist this constituent as a mental health priority, and she should be able to get those 20 treatments. She has actually found a psychologist that is bulk-billing her, which is rare as well. So we need to be looking after people like Katherine to make sure that she can get the 20 sessions that she needs, under the Medicare subsidised mental health treatment plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under a Dutton Liberal-National government, if we're given the opportunity to govern next year, that will be restored. We will make sure that there are 20 subsidised visits to see psychologists, which was cut under the Albanese Labor government, with the support of the Greens party in the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those in the government talk a lot about Medicare, as though Medicare belongs to them. Well, guess what? These are the facts. Bulk-billing has dropped under the Albanese Labor government, in Petrie, in Longman—in seats right around the country. The bulk-billing rate in 2022 was 85 per cent. Guess what it is now in Petrie? It's down to 75.5 per cent. That's a 10 per cent reduction in bulk-billing since the Albanese Labor government was elected. It's not good enough, and we will keep fighting for better health services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition, Peter Dutton, also outlined in his budget in-reply speech that we will support the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Australian Medical Association, saying:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a Coalition Government will invest $400 million to provide junior doctors who train in general practice with incentive payments, assistance with leave entitlements, and support for pre-vocational training.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has welcomed the government's investment in longer consultations for women suffering from endometriosis and pelvic pain. This, they have acknowledged, builds on the significant work that the former coalition government did in this critical area, under the leadership of Greg Hunt. But more needs to be done to support women's health. As the opposition leader has committed to, we will continue to support measures and develop policy in this area, particularly in primary care for menopause and perimenopause.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to stand here today, in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2024-2025, to talk about the federal budget, which delivers for both Australia and Tasmania. Good economic management and addressing the cost of living with commonsense, practical measures are at the heart of the Labor government's third budget, delivered on 14 May by Treasurer Jim Chalmers. We know that Australians continue to do it tough from the enduring impacts of inflation and the household pressures that arose from two years of the global COVID pandemic. That's why our Labor government continues to offer cost-of-living relief. As the Prime Minister said to the Press Club in January this year, we, as politicians, cannot say, 'We are aware of the cost of living, and we are just sorry but we are not in a position to do anything about it.' He went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I'm the Prime Minister. I am in a position to do something about it. We are doing something about it. And it's the right thing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're good words to heed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Labor budget delivers tax cuts for every taxpayer, power-bill relief for every household, more bulk-billed Medicare urgent care clinics, more cheaper medicines, and student debt relief—all while keeping downward pressure on inflation. In two years of Labor government, we have already delivered more jobs, higher wages and bigger tax cuts than any first-term Australian government since Federation. And our Future Made in Australia plan shows that we've also got a plan to keep growing our economy and ensure that young Australians can look forward to better, higher-paying jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Liberals lost office, inflation had a six in front of it. Now it's a three, and we're working to get it even lower. Real wages have gone up for three consecutive quarters, and our closing of loopholes means fewer Aussies are getting ripped off at work. Labor has delivered two budget surpluses in two years, when the Liberals delivered zero in 10—and they call themselves the party of better economic management! Give me a break!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 July, the Albanese Labor government will proudly deliver tax cuts for every single Australian taxpayer and bigger tax cuts for most. In fact, 11.5 million Australian taxpayers—that's 84 per cent—will get a bigger tax cut under Labor than they would have under the Liberals' discarded stage 3, and 2.9 million Australian workers earning under $45,000 will get a tax cut under Labor, when, under the Liberals' stage 3, they would have received absolutely zero. In Lyons, the average tax cut will be $1,279 a year, with nine in 10 taxpayers in my electorate getting bigger tax cuts than under the Liberals. In fact, most taxpayers in Lyons will see their tax cuts doubled under Labor. A two-income household on average wages is looking at a tax cut of $2,600. That's real money going back into household budgets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our budget, we also deliver power bill relief. Every household gets $300 off their power bill, and eligible small businesses will get $325. That builds on the $250 energy bill relief that we delivered last year, which the Liberals voted against. Compare our plan to deliver power bill relief and to deliver cheaper, cleaner renewable energy with the nonsense from the opposition leader. Opposition Leader Dutton says he's committed to rolling out nuclear power but won't say when, where, how much it will cost or who will pay. The CSIRO has reported this week that nuclear power in Australia will be at least twice as expensive as renewables, and that means higher power bills under the Liberals. Under Peter Dutton, your power bills will go nuclear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget, we build on Labor's commitments to strengthen Medicare with the addition of 29 more Medicare urgent care clinics to the 58 that we opened over the last year, and we are funding more free mental health services and providing higher Medicare rebates for more common tests. Last Monday, health minister Mark Butler joined me to announce a new urgent care clinic for Bridgewater in my electorate. I strongly made the case for the people of Bridgewater to have an option that would be an alternative to driving into Hobart for non-emergency medical situations and that would also help people in surrounding areas. With no appointments and fully bulk-billed, a Bridgewater MUCC will help people in Brighton, Derwent Valley, Bagdad, Mangalore and Glenorchy, to name a few.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also expanding our cheaper medicines initiative to add more medicines onto the PBS, and we're freezing the PBS co-payment. We know that around 80 per cent of people who visit Medicare urgent care clinics would otherwise have visited a hospital emergency room, and only around one in 30 can end up having to be referred for hospital treatment. Medicare urgent care clinics are treating hundreds of thousands of people around the country, and they are taking pressure off our overstretched public hospitals. So far, Lyons residents have saved more than $800,000 thanks to Labor's cheaper medicines policy, and now pensioners and concession cardholders won't pay more than $7.70 for PBS medications for the next five years. Thanks to the Albanese government's tripling of bulk-billing incentives, residents in Lyons have made an additional 9,337 bulk-billed visits to their GPs since November. Tasmania's health system will receive a $660 million federal injection next financial year, delivering $30 million more into the state's public hospitals than in last year's federal budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Labor government knows that our economic sovereignty requires more domestic capability. COVID taught us not to be overreliant on a global supply chains. Our Future Made in Australia plan will deliver economic security and better, higher paying jobs for Australians. The opposition leader might be happy to see 'made overseas' on the things that Australians buy, but Labor wants to see more made in Australia. A future made in Australia is about creating new jobs and opportunities by maximising the economic and industrial benefits of the move to net zero and securing Australia's place in a fast-changing global landscape. Our Labor government's $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia package will encourage private sector investment in manufacturing, industry and tech—good for jobs and great for national economic security.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania's ambitions to become a key player in green hydrogen production received a boost, with $8 billion over 10 years to support the production of renewable hydrogen nationally and $1.3 billion allocated over the next four years for an additional round of the Hydrogen Headstart program.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty-three million dollars of federal funding went to continued improvements to the Tarraleah hydropower scheme in the central highlands in my electorate. Built in the late 1930s, it is one of Hydro Tasmania's oldest hydropower schemes, regulating flows to the Derwent system of dams and hydropower stations as well as the water supply to Hobart. This funding supports the Tarraleah scheme to deliver more renewable power with more flexibility in the future. </span>

This is something that the opposition leader, in his budget reply speech, said he will axe. He doesn't want government investment in this area. I note that the Tasmanian federal Liberal team have been silent on their leader's plan to gut investment in Tasmania and in renewables, which will put thousands of Tasmanian jobs at risk. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, Cement Australia, based in Railton, will receive more than $52 million to upgrade its kiln and alternative fuel facilities to enable greater use of waste. That will help to reduce coal consumption while also reducing waste going to landfill. Only Labor can support regional Australian jobs and manufacturing, all the while working towards net zero. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a sorry state of affairs to see on the front of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury</span> this morning that Tasmania's education system, after 10 years of state Liberal government, is running dead last in the nation. Tasmania under the Liberals has the highest rate of absenteeism and the lowest year 12 completion of any state. The Albanese Labor government will not stand by—and is not standing by—watching the Tasmanian Liberals continuing to fail young Tasmanians. Last week, I announced funding for schools in my electorate for much-needed upgrades and improvements. That's federal money being pumped into state public schools that have been badly let down by the Tasmanian Liberal government. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our budget delivers the skills we need for a future made in Australia, where no-one is held back and no-one is left behind. Labor's budget includes cost-of-living relief for students, support for people from the outer suburbs and regions to go to university and structural reforms to our tertiary education system. Labor is offering states and territories the largest investment in Australia's public education ever delivered. Three billion dollars in student debt will be wiped to make the HECS-HELP system fairer. In my electorate, 8,809 people—students and graduates—will see a reduction in their HELP debt. The Albanese government will also invest $350 million over four years to get students ready for university at no cost to them. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to one survey, 38 per cent of Tasmanian head teachers report a shortage of teachers in their schools. Labor is committed to funding wage increases for educators to fill the gaps. Students working hard to become teachers, nurses or social workers will receive $319.50 every week when they do mandatory practice. The same goes for those involved in vocational education placements. That includes more than 1,400 individuals in Tasmania. Tasmanian students will benefit from a $680 million budget allocation to education made through the Quality Schools funding scheme. Tasmanians received another $56.6 million under the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development, with a further $1.2 million to support fee-free TAFE. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to office, we said we'd open 180,000 fee-free TAFE places. We're well past 300,000 already and we're on the way to 500,000. That's half a million Aussies changing their lives and learning the skills that our country needs. We are so focused on closing the gap that was left to us in the key areas of skill shortages in agriculture, child care, aged-care services and construction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ten years of state and federal Liberal government smashed affordable housing in Tasmania. Tasmania used to have some of the most affordable property around, and now it's amongst the most expensive. Hobart is the least affordable city to live in relative to income, a title it shares with Sydney. Five years ago the average rent in Tasmania was $311 a week. Now it's $445—and that's if you can find a place. That's the largest increase of any other state. Under the Liberals, the number of applicants for social housing in Lyons doubled and the waiting time blew out from 16 weeks to 80. That's a year and a half on a housing waiting list.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government knows that the best way to solve this crisis is to build more houses and increase supply. We also know that one of the best ways is to allow more young people access to shared-equity schemes, which a lot of the states run, including former Liberal government states. But, for some reason, those opposite and the Greens in the Senate are blocking Labor's plan which would allow more affordable housing for young Tasmanians. The Minister for Housing, Julie Collins, is a proud Tasmanian who is striving to fix the Liberal mess. Labor already committed $30 billion to housing in our first two years in office, and this budget commits another $6 billion. We've committed to more social housing, and that means less pressure on private markets. We've increased the Commonwealth rent assistance by 10 per cent, the second consecutive increase in two years, and we're supporting veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is good for Australia. It's certainly good for Tasmania. More jobs, higher wages, bigger tax cuts, a future made in Australia—that's the plan. That's what Labor is delivering. Labor have delivered more jobs, higher wages and bigger tax cuts, and we are delivering a future made in Australia. That stands in stark contrast to the negativity and sheer incompetence of those opposite.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I'm pleased to rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2024-2025 and to make some observations about the impact of the Albanese Labor government's third budget, which was brought down recently. This budget was a missed opportunity that failed to address the multiplicity of challenges facing Australian households, families and businesses. Whether it's the poor design and strategy underpinning this budget, which is a missed opportunity to address the inflationary pressures that continue to surge in the Australian economy; whether it's not providing sufficient support to address the cost of living; or whether it's risking billions of dollars of taxpayers money on subsidising businesses chosen by politicians and bureaucrats, on every front, this budget raises very serious questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An aspect of the budget that I want to focus on in my remarks today is its impact in the government services portfolio and in the science portfolio. Both government services and science are very important areas of endeavour. The government services portfolio is all about supporting Australians who need the assistance of government in a range of ways. The science portfolio in many ways is not about this year, next year or the next five or 10 years; it's about the next 50 or 100 years. Activity occurring as a result of scientific research can deliver and repeatedly does deliver fundamental benefits to humanity. That's why every government funds and supports scientific research, and the Australian government is no different. However, I'm sorry to say that in the areas of both government services and science this budget has been a considerable disappointment, and I want to delve into some of the ways in which it has been a disappointment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's start with government services. I want to draw a sharp contrast between the philosophy underpinning the management of government services—if it can be dignified with the term 'management' under the present Minister for Government Services, the member for Maribyrnong—and the demonstrated historical behaviour of Australians to adopt technology enthusiastically and early in the growth of particular technologies. Consider the way that consumers in Australia have embraced the digital offerings of banks, telcos, supermarkets and airlines. As customers, Australians have demonstrated with their behaviour that they consider the digital option to be a fast and convenient one and one that can sometimes save you money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians bring similar preferences into their dealings with government. Around 90 per cent of Services Australia's customers choose to interact with the agency via digital means. Yet, curiously, in this budget we've seen an approach that, rather than bolstering the digital capability of Services Australia, instead takes away digital capability and re-weights capability towards person-to-person interactions. In many ways the Albanese government is taking Services Australia back in time by adding more Canberra based bureaucrats while allowing the digital capabilities of Services Australia to languish. Over three years, Labor will spend more than $1.8 billion on more than 7,500 additional Public Service positions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The justification for this is that there is a need to address a backlog in claims. Of course, that backlog in claims, which has exploded over the last two years, reflects the grossly incompetent management by the Minister for Government Services. Let's look at the facts. Based on the most recent published numbers, at December last year, Services Australia takes 82½ days to process a claim for a low-income card. Under the coalition, by contrast, it was 16 days. If you call Services Australia while it's under the care of the member for Maribyrnong, you need to be patient. For example, if you call the Disability, Sickness and Carers line, whereas under the coalition you needed to wait for 21 minutes—too long, it must be admitted, but that was the time under the coalition—now you will wait more than 48 minutes when you call this Services Australia telephone line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The premise of the changes made in this budget is that, after Mr Shorten created this catastrophic decline in service levels, the way to fix it is to put on more staff. But actually, if you look at the numbers, it's very clear that there is no correlation between staff numbers and service levels. The evidence of that is that under the coalition in 2021-22 the average staffing level at Services Australia was 26,838. In February 2024 that level was 28,570. So, staffing levels have gone up from 26,838 under the coalition to 28,570 under Labor while service levels have gone down. Far from a positive correlation between extra staff and better service levels under the member for Maribyrnong, as Minister for Government Services, we've seen the extraordinarily perverse outcome that staff levels have gone up and service levels have gone down. Yet Mr Shorten's only solution to this catastrophic cratering in service levels is to put in more people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who has said that they are pleased with this decision? You won't be surprised to hear that it's the Community and Public Sector Union. They are a big winner out of this. More public servants means more union members. It's all too typical of the Albanese Labor government to put the interests of the union mates ahead of the interests of the Australians that Services Australia is there to serve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A major contributor to the dismal and worsening performance of Services Australia has been the antipathy of the Albanese Labor government towards the use of technology. The minister, the member for Maribyrnong, has the wrong priorities and has made a series of bad decisions. The digital capability of Services Australia has been left to stagnate, and the recent budget continues that stagnation. Over the forward estimates, funding for Services Australia's technology and transformation program will decline. They're cutting money from technology and transformation. Automation processes for key Centrelink payments have been turned off. The guts have been ripped out of the agency's digital program suite. More than a thousand specialist ICT—information and communications technology—workers have been let go, and an axed contract with specialist outsourcing firm Serco has reduced the telephony capacity of Services Australia. These are the decisions that underpin the catastrophic reduction in service levels that I've spoken about.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has announced some spending for myGov, but that spending is doing nothing more than keeping this vital platform on life support. The myGov user audit—commissioned, as it happens, by the incoming government—recommended that there be a road map for the future of myGov. There has been no road map released, and it's unclear when new features of myGov will come online. This is, sadly, very consistent with the record and the form of the member for Maribyrnong. He's got form in promising big and delivering little when it comes to myGov. In February 2023, he promised that the Commonwealth's digital Medicare card would be available within the Service NSW app by mid-2023. Here we are in May 2024, and New South Wales residents are still waiting for this feature to show up. The efficient, simple, safe delivery of government payments and services depends critically on the effectiveness of the underlying technology platforms. The failure to transform and uplift Services Australia's core ICT systems by this current Labor government risks turning the current myGov platform into an empty shell.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget was, equally, a missed opportunity for Australia's very impressive—indeed, world-renowned—scientific and research sectors. Technology and innovation are absolutely key to our economic performance and to our future, and scientific research underpins technology and innovation. We have seen in this budget a boost in funding for bureaucrats in Canberra and for American technology firms at the expense of basic scientific research activity. The Albanese Labor government proudly trumpeted the decision to invest almost a billion dollars of taxpayers' money to an American quantum computing company, with no similar funding in the budget for the many promising Australian-based quantum computing companies. Labor's science funding priorities are bizarre. The government is cutting resources from Australian science while spraying around hundreds of millions to enrich American venture capital businesses which are investors in the American company, PsiQuantum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The deal between the Australian and Queensland governments and PsiQuantum has been cloaked in secrecy, but we do know that there's a further $27.7 million allocated for bureaucrats in Canberra to oversee it. There's no question that quantum computing has enormous potential, but it also presents daunting scientific and technical challenges in getting to the point where there's a robust, proven, commercially viable quantum computer in existence that is able to do a better and more cost-effective job than existing supercomputer technology of deploying large amounts of computing power to very quickly solve very big problems. Yet, despite this uncertainty which is acknowledged by all in the field, the Albanese Labor government has chosen to bet a very large amount of money on one particular company pursuing one particular technology path, and it must be said that there are many potential parts in quantum computing being investigated by a whole range of companies and researchers in Australia and around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has made this investment at a stage when, on any view, it will be at least several years and very possibly longer before the technology being developed by PsiQuantum is proven to work, and the decision to make this investment follows a highly questionable process which has failed to meet normal standards of transparency and contestability. Australians deserve to know why this deal was cloaked in secrecy, why there was no public, transparent expression of interest process to call for applications, why only a small number of companies were invited to participate and were all required to sign non-disclosure agreements and why the terms of the process made it look, according to many who participated, as if it had been written so that PsiQuantum was going to be the winner. It would be particularly concerning if this decision by the Albanese Labor government to invest so much money in a foreign quantum computing company ends up making it more difficult for Australian based quantum companies to compete for global investment because of a perception which will arise on the part of investors that their own government does not believe in these Australian based quantum computing companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All this is happening while, at the same time, we've seen funding cut in a range of other areas of the science budget. Labor has axed funding in the space sector by terminating the $1.2 billion National Space Mission for Earth Observation, which had been scheduled to launch four satellites between 2028 and 2033. CSIRO is having its staffing cut, and CSIRO is having its funding cut in 2024-25 by $14 million. The fact is that there's little good news for science in this budget and, where there has been significant funding allocated, it has been allocated in a highly questionable decision to make a single big bet on one untested and unproven technology. There has also been extensive criticism of a lack of attention to the importance of artificial intelligence in this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget has been a disappointment on many fronts. It is certainly a disappointment when it comes to both government services and science.</span>

                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:31</span>):  'I will deliver a surplus in the first year of a Tony Abbott government and every year thereafter'—so said Joe Hockey, the then shadow Treasurer, in 2013. Not once did the coalition deliver a surplus. The Liberal and National parties left us a trillion dollars of debt. We have turned a $78 billion deficit into a $22 billion surplus in our first year in office, and we've turned a projected $57 billion deficit into a $9 billion surplus in the budget, reducing government debt by $150 billion initially and then by $180 billion. So, in nine budgets, debt and deficit were worse under the coalition—the second-highest taxing government in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia, surpassed only by the Howard and Costello government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a macro level, through the budgetary process, we're getting debt and deficit under control. At a micro level, I know that people in my electorate find it hard with the cost-of-living pressures. The budget is designed to help people who are under pressure now, while setting Australians up for the future. I know that what's important to them is to make sure that, when they go to the shops and when they pay their energy bills, they can get a better deal for themselves. That's why every taxpayer in my electorate will find relief in the budget, due to the revised stage 3 tax cuts that we have brought in. Some 2.9 million Australians who would not have got a cent of tax relief under the coalition are now getting tax relief under the Labor government. Some 13.6 million Australians are getting tax relief. In addition, we're providing every household with $300 of their energy bills. We're investing in a future made in Australia. We're certainly seeing the expression of that in Ipswich in my electorate. We're investing in much-needed local road infrastructure projects in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a Labor budget for average Australians—working-class Australians and middle-class Australians. It's designed to take pressure off working families. We're talking about good news in my electorate. For example, from 1 July this year, there will be tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer in Blair. Eighty thousand people in Blair—every single taxpayer—will get a tax cut. The average tax cut for taxpayers in my electorate is $1,380, and 90 per cent of taxpayers will be better off. Critically, the tax cuts delivered by Labor will be bigger for low- and middle-income earners than those of the previous coalition government, and that'll help with cost-of-living relief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also delivering a better deal for working families by paying superannuation on government funded paid parental leave. This will make the super scheme fairer for families, particularly families with children. It will benefit 180,000 families a year. The government's also providing $3.5 billion in energy price relief. Of course, those opposite voted against the energy price relief when we put forward bills in relation to that previously, so let's get rid of the sanctimonious and untrue statements from those opposite saying they're concerned with energy price relief when they had a chance to vote for it and didn't do so. From 1 July 2024, more than 10 million households will each receive a total rebate of $300 and eligible small businesses will receive a rebate of $325 on their electricity bills through the year. This comes on top of the $1,000 Queensland government energy rebate, which means families in Blair will get $1,300 in total off their energy bills next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that note, by the way, it was terrific to have the Treasurer at the Ipswich Show on the Sunday following the budget to have a chat with locals about the cost-of-living relief measures provided in the budget. He had many chats with local businesses and individuals at my stall there. It was also an opportunity for local businesses who were exhibiting at the show to show their wares, and I congratulate the show society and encourage those local businesses who are having challenging times to make sure that they get the help they need and deserve and that they get access to people like the Treasurer to have a chat with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget also provides some very important and big investments in key projects like the Mount Crosby interchange and the Bremer River Bridge, as well as funding local roads. The budget provides $42.5 million for the Bremer River Bridge strengthening, and that's really critical. The bridge has been affected over time, including by the many floods we've had in Ipswich, such as the 1974 flood, the 2011 flood, the 2013 flood and, of course, the 2022 flood. There have been changes to the industrial precincts and housing in the area, and the hydrology and topography of the river have changed, so this is critical to make sure that the Warrego Highway and the conditions for the traffic that goes over that bridge and towards Brisbane and Ipswich and on to Toowoomba are upgraded. It's very important to make sure that bridge is stable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's $134.5 million for the Mount Crosby interchange upgrade, so that's a total of $177 million for these two vital projects on the Warrego Highway. That's really important. About 58,000 vehicles a day go through the Mount Crosby interchange. It's critical for the suburbs in Brisbane and Ipswich like Karana Downs, Mount Crosby, Karalee, Tivoli, Chuwar, North Ipswich and Brassall and even for people in suburbs like Booval, East Ipswich, Raceview and Flinders View. Big suburbs on the south side also benefit, because this is an important entrance into Ipswich. The Cunningham Highway, the Warrego Highway and the Ipswich motorway are the three main entrances into Ipswich from Brisbane. So this is absolutely vital. We're doing another bridge over the Warrego Highway. It will connect to a secured road corridor towards Moggill and the Brisbane River. That's a very important safety upgrade. It's important for the lives, livelihoods and lifestyles of the people in my community. It's absolutely critical for freight that goes towards Brisbane and Toowoomba and to the Lockyer Valley and the Somerset region as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Blair is one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. It's No. 2 in electoral enrolment in Queensland. So it's a very fast-growing community around Ipswich, with the satellite cities of Springfield and Ripley as well. So the budget is investing in infrastructure in our community. There's a record amount of Roads to Recovery funding as well. There is an additional $1.5 million for the Cunningham Highway Safety Package. We have $132.2 million, one of the largest funding commitments under Roads to Recovery in the country. My electorate includes parts of Brisbane and, of course, Ipswich as well as the Somerset Region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased, as chair of the Queensland Black Spot Consultative Panel, to see that the budget provides $10.8 million for one year for the national road safety education and awareness campaign, which is critical in Queensland. We have large roads and a large volume of traffic, including trucks. It's a really important education and awareness campaign. There's $21.1 million over four years to improve the reporting of national road safety data via the National Road Safety Data Hub. That's absolutely critical. This is so important for my community in our big regional and rural electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's providing assistance to make the HECS-HELP system fairer by cutting $3 billion in student debt for more than three million Australians. I've got two university campuses in my electorate: USQ Ipswich and USQ Springfield. That change will help 23,000 people with HELP debt locally. We're capping the HELP indexation rate to the lower of either the CPI or the wage price index—that's really critical—and we're backdating it to 1 June 2023. Those with a HELP debt will receive a credit, and HELP debts will never grow faster than wages—absolutely vital for people living in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're investing $2.8 billion to strengthen Medicare by providing additional Medicare urgent care clinics, more free mental health services, higher Medicare rebates for many common medical tests and over $160 million in a women's health package. Patients in my electorate had the benefit of nearly 6,000 visits to the Ipswich Medicare urgent care clinic, and I can see what a benefit these types of clinics will be elsewhere. This is ensuring local families can get bulk-billed care when they need it, reduce out-of-pocket costs and take pressure off the Ipswich Hospital emergency department.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're expanding Medicare coverage to four MRI machines in Blair, from the Mater in Springfield to Ipswich central. It's really important for my electorate to have that. The figures are quite clear: 73,376 residents in Blair will benefit as, in the past year, they have accessed 223,201 pathology services. It's very important to make sure these tests stay bulk-billed by extending the Medicare rebate for common medical tests, including waiting times, and catching health problems sooner. That's very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week I opened the new Ipswich Medicare Mental Health Centre, formerly known as Head to Health, in Nicholas Street Precinct in Ipswich, in the mall—delivering on another commitment I made at the last election. This vital service provides free walk-in mental health care in a safe and welcoming space without the need to make an appointment. And I'm very pleased with the engagement with local First Nations people in the naming of the various rooms. It's a large precinct and it's very important for local people in my electorate. It complements and adds onto the headspace that we've provided in East Street for younger people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're investing $4 billion to deliver cheaper medicines to ease pressure on household budgets by freezing PBS co-payments and adding more medicines to the PBS. Residents in Blair have already saved more than $2 million thanks to the Albanese government's commitment to deliver cheaper medicines. Everyone in Blair who accesses PBS medicines are set to save even more as a result of the freeze in the maximum cost of the PBS medicine. What's more, pensioners and concession cardholders won't pay more than $7.70 for their PBS medications for the next five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're investing $1.9 billion to help nearly one million Australian households with the cost of rent by increasing the maximum rate of the Commonwealth rent assistance by 10 per cent. That builds on the 15 per cent increase we announced in September 2023. Combined with indexation, we'll take maximum rates more than 40 per cent higher than when we won office in May 2022. This will benefit 12,630 households in Blair. This is the first back-to-back increase in rent assistance in more than 30 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to housing affordability, particularly in my electorate with young families and fast-growing satellite cities inside of the City of Ipswich, the Albanese government is delivering billions more in the budget to build homes across the country. I was pleased to have the Minister for Housing, Minister Julie Collins, out to my electorate recently. She was inspecting some of the housing boom that is taking place in the Ripley Valley. We need to boost supply. There is a $6.2 billion boost in the budget, taking the government's total housing investment to more than $32 billion. This builds on existing policies, like the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, which I wish the coalition had voted for. It opposed it. There's also the $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator and the Help to Buy shared equity scheme, which they did not approve of or support either. More than 1,600 people moved to Ipswich in the first quarter of this year, so doing this will help to ensure we have the increase in housing infrastructure we need to meet our growing population. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that is really important for the about 7,000 participants in the NDIS in my electorate is making sure that we get every dollar in the scheme to the people who really need it the most. One of the big issues for not just my electorate office but those elsewhere around the country is making sure that local people get access to the NDIS and get what they need. The budget allocates a further $468.7 million to support people with disability and get the NDIS back on track. There's $214 million over two years to fight fraud and to co-design NDIS reforms with people with disability. That's critical. I've seen evidence—and I've taken it to the minister—of occasions in my electorate where I felt people were not doing the right thing. If people aren't doing the right thing, I'm calling on people in my electorate to bring it forward to my office, to make complaints about it and to take it further, because we've got to make sure that people who are living with disability are not abused. There is a shocking power imbalance for those perpetrators of abuse, those criminals and thieves who want to abuse the system. The fraud needs to be stamped out. So I'm calling on people to do the right thing. This is absolutely vital to the thousands of people in my electorate as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we're making sure that we make a future made in Australia. This is critical—and I was pleased to see the Prime Minister in Ipswich for this. We're providing $15.3 million to support the manufacture and export of 100 Boxer heavy weapon carriers to Germany. That's provided for in the budget. They'll be manufactured by Rheinmetall Defence Australia at Redbank in Ipswich. The contract is valued at more than $3 billion. There will be 600 direct local jobs and hundreds of indirect jobs, involving 300 local companies. That's supporting small business. It's the largest defence export agreement in Australia's history and it makes sure that Ipswich is at the forefront of the global defence industry.</span>

We've seen, once again, through the government's homegrown inflation, that the cost of living is up, energy prices are up, mortgages are up and grocery bills are up. The latest inflation data shows that, under Labor, prices across the board have risen by close to 10 per cent, with increases even greater in essential items. Food is up 10 per cent. Housing is up 12 per cent. Gas is up 25 per cent. Electricity is up 18 per cent. But what do we see in this budget? Do we see any effort to address the issues that are at the root of this inflation? No, we don't. Labor have instead made budgetary decisions that only create a situation where inflation will worsen or the risk that inflation will worsen will increase. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen additional spending in this budget of some $315 billion in addition to significant increases in spending in previous budgets. This is some $30,000 of additional spending for every Australian household. It's this extra spending that doesn't take pressure off inflation but risks compounding the problem. Prolonged inflation, as we all know, means that your money is worth less. It means that your real income is falling and that costs are continuing to increase. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past two years of the Albanese Labor government, we've seen family budgets smashed by higher prices, higher mortgage repayments and higher taxes. The average Australian household with a mortgage—and there are many across the electorate of Forde—is now $35,000 worse off following three Labor budgets while they have been in government. This budget does nothing to restore what Labor has cost Australians, and we'll all be poorer as a result. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the electorate of Forde, Labor has failed to address the cost-of-living concerns for local residents. At the same time, they've failed to deliver support for important projects across the Forde electorate. For each of Labor's budgets so far in government, I've written to the Treasurer urging him to fund vital projects not just for the benefit of residents within the electorate of Forde but also for those living in his electorate, Rankin, which neighbours Forde. I'm incredibly disappointed to say that those budget submissions have gone unanswered in terms of funding being included in the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting to note that the projects that are occurring in the electorate of Forde at the moment were all funded under a previous coalition government. Other than some additional funding from this government due to project cost blowouts, there have been no new additional projects across the electorate of Forde that have been funded by this government. That includes those that I wrote to the Treasurer about again this year. They have been left unfunded and completely ignored. There are a number of worthwhile projects across the electorate of Forde which need to be built, particularly the priority road projects—and particularly the M1. I note from the budget papers that additional funding is continuing for those. But, importantly, those projects need to be fast-tracked, given the level of growth that is occurring in South-East Queensland. Can I also say that this is where the state Labor government, under the Premier, Steven Miles, is also at fault for not planning and progressing those projects anywhere near quickly enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the major projects we asked for on the M1 was the upgrade of exit 38 at Yatala, which we took as a commitment to the 2022 election. This is a vital exit that is probably the last exit between the Albert River and the Coomera River that needs to be upgraded. The coalition government successfully delivered upgrades to exit 54, an upgrade to exit 49—which is presently underway with a $55 million investment—and a $41 million investment to the upgrade of exit 41 at Yatala. We also provided some $10 million for a small upgrade to exit 45 at Ormeau. That exit will still require further significant upgrades as time progresses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Exit 38 provides access to the Yatala enterprise area, both on the eastern side of the M1 and on the western side. If you have a look at those two major business areas on the northern end of the Gold Coast and the sheer volume of traffic that goes through that interchange, it's extremely disappointing that the government hasn't seen fit to fund the $60 million that is required to upgrade that exit, in addition to an equivalent commitment from the state government. The state government has had the plan sitting on its desk since 2018 and done nothing—zero, zip. It's the same with the other exits I just mentioned. If it weren't for the funding that was provided by a coalition federal government, those exits would still not be getting upgraded, because the state government under Labor had no plans to upgrade those exits. It was only through the work by my former colleague Stuart Robert and me to get that federal funding that we got those exits upgraded. It just shows that Labor governments, both state and federal, don't care much for the electorate of Forde.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to exit 38, we called for funding to commence the duplication of Beenleigh Redland Bay Road to the tune of $40 million, and we called for another $40 million for additional lanes and upgrades on the Mount Lindesay Highway between Chambers Flat Road and Greenbank Road. Sadly, none of that funding was provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you, Mr Deputy Speaker Young, and others would know, our sporting clubs play a valuable role across our community. We have a number of major projects that we'd sought funding for. The funding for the Hammel Park upgrade, which would provide upgrades for Beenleigh netball, Beenleigh rugby league and Beenleigh baseball clubs, wasn't forthcoming. We also sought funding to assist the Ormeau Bulldogs AFL Club to install field and car park lighting as well as the implementation of the Beenleigh tennis centre's master plan. No funding was provided for those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, for the arts, which can often be overlooked—and, in this case, they were—the funding we sought to assist Phoenix Ensemble to upgrade some of the facilities within their theatre was not forthcoming. When we were in the middle of a youth crisis, it was disappointing to see that the Logan City Council's submission for funding to install 120 CCTV cameras around the City of Logan, which would have also benefited the electorate of Rankin and the electorate of Wright, was also not supported. Once again, we see that the current Labor government does not care for the upgrades of facilities that are required across the electorate of Forde.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is in contrast to what we did as a coalition government. We provided funding for clubhouse upgrades at Chris Green Park. That project is now well underway and will be finished hopefully in the next few months. We provided funding for the clubhouse and change rooms for the Ormeau Shearers Junior Rugby League, change room upgrades for Logan Basketball, field lighting for the Mustangs Brothers Rugby League Football Club, upgrades to the Mt Warren Park golf club and also upgrades to the clubhouse facilities at Cornubia Park for Logan Lightning Football Club. It is, once again, a stark demonstration of the difference between what a coalition government delivered for the electorate of Forde and what the current federal Labor government is failing to deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, in uncertain economic times such as these, we need a budget that gets back to basics, addresses the underlying issues and helps Australia get back on that. To do this, three key measures need to be met: the budget must restore our standard of living by addressing inflation and the pressures being felt by families at the check-out and from their energy bills; restore prosperity and create opportunity by supporting small businesses and helping young Australians into a home; and restore budget discipline and honesty by restraining spending, bringing back fiscal guardrails and a tax-to-GDP cap and delivering a structural surplus, not a windfall surplus. This is what a future coalition government will be focused on delivering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already recommitted to allowing Australians to access up to $50,000 of their super to buy their first home and extended this policy to separated women to help restart their lives. Additionally, we would support Australian families and businesses by implementing policy which takes inflationary pressures off the economy and provides it with the right environment to foster growth through measures such as: implementing a two-year ban on foreign investors and temporary residents purchasing existing homes in Australia; reducing the permanent migration program by 25 per cent, from 185,000 to 140,000, for the first two years in recognition of the urgency of the housing crisis; reducing excess numbers of foreign students studying at metropolitan universities, to relieve the stress on rental markets in our major cities; extending the value of the assets eligible for the instant asset write-off to $30,000 and making this ongoing for small business; removing red tape from business by restoring the pre-existing definitions of 'casual worker' and bringing back certainty for thousands of small businesses across the country; and doubling the existing work bonus from $300 per fortnight to $600 so older Australians and veterans can work more, should they wish, without reducing their pension payments. We also announced in the Leader of the Opposition's budget-in-reply speech the incentivisation for more junior doctors to become GPs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that people living in Logan and the northern Gold Coast are doing it tough and, for the third budget in a row, they've looked to this Labor government to provide relief and support through the cost-of-living and inflationary crisis. Once again, sadly, I can report that they have been let down by the current Labor government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  I'm really pleased to rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2024-2025 and related bills. On 1 July this year the Albanese Labour government will deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer. That's a tax cut for 13.6 million people, including 81,000 people in my electorate of Chisholm. Every taxpayer in my electorate will receive a tax cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The average tax cut for taxpayers in my electorate will be $1,640. Of course, we know that Labor's tax cuts will deliver a bigger tax cut for Middle Australia to help with the cost-of-living compared with the previously legislated cuts. Under our plan, an additional 2.9 million Australians earning $45,000 or less, who were excluded under the coalition's plan, will now share in the benefits of these tax cuts. These will provide greater tax relief to low- and middle-income taxpayers from 1 July. These taxpayers are disproportionately women, so these tax cuts will see 90 per cent of female taxpayers retaining, on average, an additional $707 per year compared with the previously legislated tax cuts. In our budget, we've also increased the Medicare levy low-income thresholds, ensuring that more than one million low-income taxpayers will continue to be exempt from the Medicare levy or pay a reduced levy rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are providing $3.5 billion in energy bill relief for all Australian households and one million eligible small businesses. From 1 July, more than 10 million households will receive a total rebate of $300, and eligible small businesses will receive $325 on their electricity bills throughout the year. I know that this is really good news for small businesses and households alike. We already know that our current energy bill relief plan has moderated electricity price increases. This is really important. Prices increased by just two per cent through the year to the March quarter. We know that, had that relief not been provided, prices would have increased by 14.9 per cent, almost 15 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget recognises that households and small businesses remain under pressure. We are going to extend and expand relief already provided. This is truly a Labor budget, and a budget designed to help people who are under pressure right now while setting Australians up for the future. This is a budget for the here and now but also a budget for a better future for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many are doing it tough right now, and our No. 1 priority is to ease cost-of-living pressures. We're also able, at the same time, to invest in a future made in Australia. This is a budget for every Australian and for every person in my electorate of Chisholm. Every taxpayer will receive a tax cut and every household will receive energy bill relief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An issue that I know is really important to my electorate is the issue of student debt. We're wiping around $3 billion of student debt, and in my electorate that will impact 24,430 people. Overall, it will impact three million Australians. I've had parents and students alike writing to me about the importance of this change. In fact, I made my own submission to the Universities Accord process that our government initiated. This was something that I heard loudly and clearly from my electorate. It was a really important step that we could take as a government, and I'm really pleased that wages will never move slower than student debt and that debt will never outpace the amount of money someone can expect to earn in their job. We're also introducing a Commonwealth prac payment for teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students undertaking mandatory placements. We're also delivering fee-free uni ready courses to provide more students with the enabling pathways to higher education. This is expected to increase the number of students undertaking these courses by 40 per cent by 2030 and double the number of students by 2040. This helps us with our ambition to see more Australians being able to realise their ambition of higher education. This is going to give more Australians the skills they need to get into the courses they want to study. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those in insecure housing, we're kickstarting the construction of more homes in every part of the country. For those who need access to medicines, we're cutting the prices of more common medications through our cheaper medicines policy. If you're a working parent in receipt of paid parental leave, we're providing a better deal by paying you superannuation. This is a really extraordinary step. I know there have been so many advocates for this in the community, and I want to thank them for their advocacy over the years. There is, of course, always more to do for a government, and we will keep working every day to deliver for all Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the added cost-of-living relief we've delivered in this budget builds on our work to take pressure off people, critically, without adding to the pressure on inflation. This is a budget to train more tradies, to build more homes, to boost bulk-billing and to give more Australians an opportunity to access university or TAFE. Our budget is investing in a future made in Australia—the transformative opportunities of clean energy and innovative technology. We're strengthening our defence industry and capability and investing in strategic industries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know how important sovereign capability and good, well-paid, secure jobs are for our communities, including mine in Chisholm. I speak to my constituents about this issue all the time, and I'm really privileged to represent a part of the country where we see a thriving hub of activity in these transformative industries. I have met with people working in innovation, in clean energy, in advanced manufacturing, in pharmaceutical and medical technologies, and I'm really optimistic about our future and about the opportunities that are possible for people working and living in my electorate of Chisholm. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, because of our responsible economic management, our government has been able to forecast a second consecutive budget surplus. This is quite significant. In addition to being able to forecast that surplus, we're building on cost-of-living measures that have already been taken, such as cheaper child care, cheaper medicines and fee-free TAFE. Really, this budget is about two things: acting on cost-of-living pressures and building our economy for the future—making our future here in Australia—a better future where nobody is left behind. Some of this can be seen in our ambitious Homes for Australia Plan, which will help more Australians rent, build and buy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we acknowledge that no single budget can fix all the problems that are being caused by global uncertainty and a tricky economic climate—not to mention an unfortunate 10 years of neglect and waste from those opposite—we do know that the measures we've announced in this budget will help make a real difference to people in Chisholm and right across the nation. This is a Labor budget through and through because it is a budget for every Australian, not just some, and it's a true Labor budget because, while it's designed to help people under pressure here and now, it also invests in the jobs, skills, energy and infrastructure to power our growth in the future. This is an ambitious and optimistic budget because we are ambitious and optimistic for Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this budget is framed in the context of challenging and fragile global conditions. The global economy is resilient in parts but subdued overall. We see tensions around the world and we know that global supply chains are still fragmenting. Despite all of this, we as a government want Australians to know that we are amongst the best placed economies to manage these uncertainties and maximise our opportunities. As the Treasurer pointed out in his budget address, we have an enviable combination of moderating inflation, record new jobs, new record participation, real wages growth, the lowest ever gender pay gap and expanding business investment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we know that annual inflation has more than halved from its peak in 2022, we know that people are still feeling pressures. That's why we've designed our cost-of-living policies to ease those pressures and take another three-quarters of a percentage point off inflation this year and half a percentage point off next year. Treasury is now forecasting that inflation could return to target earlier, with the possibility of this occurring by the end of the year. This is all happening while around 780,000 jobs have been created under this government, which is a record for any first term. These jobs mean security to people. They mean an opportunity to pursue ambitions for households. These are significant things. This is also a stronger jobs growth than in any major advanced economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this, real wages are growing again for the first time in almost three years. This is a really important development for our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget represents responsible relief that eases pressure on people and directly reduces inflation. We're delivering a tax cut for every taxpayer, we're providing electricity bill relief for people and small businesses, and we're making student loans fairer. I know that freezing the cost of medicines for pensioners and concession card holders for five years will provide meaningful relief. What this means is that no pensioner or concession card holder will pay more than $7.70 for the medicine that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget shows that we are realistic about the pressures that people face right now, but we are also optimistic and ambitious about the future. We are realistic—that's why we are acting to support Australians now—but we can see the optimism in the significant investments in the future for people in our country. To realise the opportunities of a future made in Australia, we are changing the way we attract and deploy investment in our economy. We know that the global energy transformation presents a generational opportunity for Australia. The world is changing and the pace of that change is accelerating. Our approach to growth and investment needs to change as well. We know that, if we hold back, the chance for a new generation of jobs and prosperity will pass us by, and that will make us more vulnerable and poorer. And that's not what we want to see for Australia.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really disappointed to hear, from those opposite, such negativity about some of these really positive steps. We don't have an energy policy from those opposite. I am really disappointed, too, at the lack of ambition and optimism that those opposite seem to have for Australian ingenuity and for our communities. We are trying to deliver to people who are under pressure right now, while making sure that our economy and our vision for this country are strong and ambitious for the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really proud to be part of a government that is managing to do all of these things at once. We're not just thinking about the here and now; we're thinking about the future. We're investing in education. We're investing in skills. We're investing in industry. We're investing in housing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think all of us in this place want to leave knowing that the country looks better at the end of our time than it did at the start. I think that, through a budget like this, and through the efforts that our government is continuing to make to invest in relieving cost-of-living pressures now but building a better future for Australians where no-one is left behind, a lot of us will be able to look back and say that that was achieved. I'm really proud to be part of a government that's continuing to prioritise the welfare and future of Australians everywhere, and I commend these bills to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  How can a government that knows the serious pain that people are in across this country give so much to billionaires and big corporations and so little—scraps—to the people doing it tough? We know there are millions of renters and mortgage holders in serious financial stress right now, making tough choices between paying the rent or the mortgage and feeding their families. We know that people are struggling to put food on the table because the supermarkets are price-gouging and are being allowed to do it by the major parties. People are sending their kids to school with hungry bellies. There are ordinary people being forced to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet and missing out on time to actually live a good life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows all of this—except, in this budget right now, every politician in this place will get $4½ thousand off their tax. That's at a cost of over $80 billion, just for the tax cuts for people earning over $200,000 a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has $175 billion in tax handouts for property investors over the next four years. That is money that goes towards property investors that allows them to go to auctions and beat out renters trying to buy their first home and bid up the price of housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite oil and gas corporations last year making $164 billion in revenue, the revenue that the government will make from their oil and gas tax this year is just $1 billion. That is a 0.6 per cent return on their oil and gas tax. That means a nurse pays a higher tax rate than some of the biggest multinational gas corporations, including Chevron, Santos and Woodside. That's outrageous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They've also announced and found in this budget, over the next 10 years, $50 billion extra in defence spending, to bring total defence spending to $750 billion over the next 10 years. Imagine how much public housing that could build. Imagine what that could do for putting dental into Medicare or making sure we could fully wipe student debt, not just tinker around the edges. Instead, that money is going to disastrous projects like the nuclear attack submarines, the AUKUS submarines, which have nothing to do with Australian safety and everything to do with backing up the United States' ambitions and backing in United States foreign policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the government has the temerity to brag about a $9.3 billion surplus. They're sitting on $9.3 billion; it's just sitting there. That could build over 18,000 public homes in a single year, changing the lives of tens of thousands of people. But the government is just sitting on that money.</span>

                    </a>  Reducing the national debt—there we go; we heard it from a member opposite. I frankly do not think anyone who is choosing right now between feeding their kids and paying the rent cares about reducing the national debt. What they care about is staying in their home. What they care about is not being on a public housing waitlist for 10 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to housing, let's talk about the housing crisis. This is the worst housing crisis Australia has faced in generations, and the most money that the government is going to spend—the biggest line items in this budget for housing—is on tax handouts for property investors: tens of billions of dollars, $175 billion over the next four years, in handouts for property investors. That's where the lion's share of government spending on housing is going. These are property investors who go to auctions and bid up the price of housing, beating out first-home buyers. Imagine how many public homes we could build if instead we were giving that money to build public housing and help out renters rather than to wealthy property investors. By the way—and let's be clear about this—over 70 per cent of the Labor caucus in this place are property investors; 65 per cent of the coalition members in this place are property investors. Remarkably, there are more Labor property investors than coalition property investors—something to reflect on. And the parliament, right now, with the support of the government, is refusing to change any of the tax handouts for those same property investors. How are members of the Australian public meant to look upon that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the huge, apparently really exciting announcement. But before we get to this announcement: it demonstrates how few members of this government probably get it, and how few people in the Labor Party properly get how serious the rental crisis is. Renters are in a massive crisis, and this is what the government announces: an extra $9 a week for people on Commonwealth rent assistance. Never mind that two-thirds of renters do not get Commonwealth rent assistance. That is $9 a week, when rents are going up by sometimes hundreds of dollars a week. In fact, we know that the total cost of increasing Commonwealth rent assistance by that much over the next year will be about $380 million. That sounds like a little bit, until you think about the fact that the rent increases over the next year alone, based on Parliamentary Library research, will be over $5 billion. So renters are about to cop a rent tsunami of $5 billion in rent increases, and the government is doing nothing for two-thirds of renters, and all that the one-third of renters who do get Commonwealth rent assistance will get is $9 extra a week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's worth reflecting on and talking about the human impact of the choices the government is making in refusing to freeze and cap rent increases, refusing to build enough public housing so that people aren't waiting 10 years to get into a public home, refusing to phase out the massive tax handouts for property investors. Here are just a few stories from the People's Commission into the Housing Crisis, from Everybody's Home. There are people like Lyn, who talks about how she's been homeless on and off since her marriage ended because she couldn't afford any rentals or because her landlord was selling the house. Now, at the age of 73, after a 50-year career as a nurse, she hasn't even bothered putting her name down for public housing, because they told her it would be a 10-year wait—10 years; what is she meant to do in those 10 years? Sleep in her car? By the way, if she does end up sleeping in her car, she doesn't get Commonwealth rent assistance. The way the rules are written is quite remarkable: if you do not live in a home, you don't even get Commonwealth rent assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about Joe who, at 73, has had to move six times in under 10 years. Again, landlords kept kicking him out so they could sell their houses for massive profits. By the way, when they sell their house for a massive profit, 50 per cent of that profit is tax free thanks to the Labor government. During one of those moves, Joe fell backwards down the stairs, breaking his spine and 14 ribs. Frankly, he's very fortunate to be alive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Racheal has been homeless three times since leaving a violent relationship 13 years ago. She is now facing homelessness for the fourth time in her life. Rents in her area have doubled since COVID—doubled by hundreds and hundreds of dollars—so what good is an extra $9 a week even if she were receiving Commonwealth Rent Assistance?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lucie is a single mother who has been forced to move repeatedly due to rent increases and evictions. I thought I'd actually quote from her story directly. This is from Lucie:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the last ten years my children and I have moved seven times. I have had to move as I couldn't afford the rental increases.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because I am paying my rent I probably won't be considered for public housing so this again puts me in a stressful situation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">$840! Let's just pause here for a second: this could have been stopped if the government froze rent increases. If the government froze rent increases, right now Lucie—working three jobs, raising kids, making tough choices in her life—could have stayed in her home. Those are the choices this Labor government is making. Here's Lucie again:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be a great shame on this government that when they have the power to freeze and cap rent increases, instead they choose to lock in unlimited rent increases. It should be a great shame that this government, over the next four years, will be dishing out $175 billion in tax handouts to property investors but won't spend enough money to build the public housing that this country needs to ensure people like Lucie aren't forced to make choices like this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is genuinely remarkable that the Commonwealth Bank can record a record $10 billion profit and just announce that, and the government makes no changes in the budget to make sure we take a large portion of that money back from the Commonwealth Bank, because we acknowledge that it is made off the back of the misery of millions of mortgage holders and renters, and put that towards building public housing. I thought Labor was meant to represent working people. Instead, in this budget there are vastly more amounts of money going to the super wealthy property investors than there are going to people like Lucie.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, there is something we could do about all of this. The Treasurer could have stood at the dispatch box and delivered a budget that fundamentally changed the lives of millions of people. I know people watching at home, whose faith in politics is understandably pretty low at the moment, watching the gap between the major parties shrink every single day, are starting to wonder what the point is of paying attention to this at all. The first thing I would say to them is that is part of the government's strategy. What they are trying to do is shrink the scope of what is considered possible in politics. All of a sudden, when we're in the middle of the worst cost-of-living crisis we've seen in a generation, the government isn't able to say, 'Over the next five years we could build enough public housing to clear the waitlist.' No, that's impossible. But what is possible, apparently, is giving $175 billion in tax handouts to property investors. They continue to shrink the scope of what is considered possible in politics so you switch off. That is their goal. The lower your expectations, the less they have to meet them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is entirely possible for the government to have announced this year that they were raising taxes on gas corporations, scrapping the stage 3 tax handouts for people earning over $200,000, making the supermarkets and the banks pay tax on their super profits and raising hundreds of billions of dollars. The government could do that. They could use that money to help coordinate a freeze and cap on rent increases so people who are one rent increase away from eviction get to stay in their homes. They could phase out the tax handouts for property investors and invest that money in not only building enough public housing so the most vulnerable in our society have a place to call home but building housing and renting and selling it at prices people can afford to anyone who needs one. European countries do that right now. That's the thing. Everything that I'm proposing right now is done around the world.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could entirely scrap student debt, not just tinker around the edges: scrap it entirely and make university free. There are a lot of members in this place on the Labor and Liberal sides who went to university for free. They're now denying it to millions of people, who are getting smashed by unfair massive student debts. We could bring dental into Medicare. We could bring mental health into Medicare. We could give people the things they need to get on and live a good life. Instead, this government is dishing out hundreds of billions of dollars in tax handouts and benefits to billionaires and big corporations.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  I'm very proud to be a member of the Albanese Labor government. They say that changing the government changes the country, and I think this budget was definitely evidence for that. Tax cuts, road and transport funding, placement payments for nurses and for teachers, and HECS debt write-offs are just some of the big wins for the country and for Macarthur residents in particular. From 1 July, our reformed tax policy will provide larger and fairer tax cuts to more Australian households, meaning that virtually every taxpayer will get more back from their tax return. Under our federal government, those earning from $40,000 a year will receive a tax cut, as opposed to the coalition's plan, which had no tax cut for the same income bracket. Your return increases with salary, so you'll be better off under our policy and you'll get much more back in the next tax year than you would have under the previous government. This means that you get more of your money back into your pocket to help with your financial needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're very much aware that there is a cost-of-living problem around the developed world. Our government is providing much-needed investment and support and helping people struggling with an economy that is under stress. We're getting inflation under control, and we're getting things done for our communities. In my community of Macarthur, we're getting funding for an upgrade to Appin Road from Appin to the Mount Gilead Estate and for the St Johns Road intersection on Appin Road, and further funding is planned in the future as we develop the new communities to the south of Appin. We're getting money for the south-west rail project, a scoping study to make the business case to extend the Western Sydney Airport rail link from the city of Bradfield to Leppington in my electorate of Macarthur. We're getting the rapid Sydney bus infrastructure upgrade of over $100 million and the Spring Farm parkway, connecting parts of my electorate from Camden to Campbelltown and Menangle across the M5 motorway. These announcements will make a huge difference to Macarthur residents, and they are a really great thing for the electorate. I'm very excited about them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to these important supports, we've announced that university students studying degrees in teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work will receive placement payments, as I said. I'm hoping that will extend also at some stage to medical students. The new payments will provide around 68,000 eligible higher education students and over 5,000 VET students each year with just over $300 per week during their clinical and professional placements. This will be means tested and available from 1 July 2025 and will be in addition to any income support the student may also receive. Further, we've announced that our federal government will cut student debt for more than three million Australians backdated to 1 July last year, and 23,500 Macarthur apprentices, students and trainees will benefit from this. This will help those with HECS debts. I know that in many families this is a big problem. It will reduce their HECS debts and reduce the increases in HECS debts that people have every year. Many people around the country will benefit from this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I strongly welcome these measures, and I know that whilst there's much more to do—especially when it comes to dealing with cost-of-living pressures—these are practical, important steps to handle these pressures while also tackling inflation and global problems. In terms of the other cost-of-living measures, there's the energy bill relief of $300 to every household. There's the rent assistance payments, the cheaper medicines policy, and in health we're doing what we can to improve access to primary care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's long been a concern of mine that access to good quality primary care through GPs in Australia has been deteriorating in many areas. It's particularly so in disadvantaged areas and in rural, regional and remote areas. Our GP workforce is ageing, and it's particularly so in the country and the bush. In some places—like in the Deputy Speaker's area of Tasmania—there have been huge problems with access to affordable general practices. Our bulk-billing incentives announced at the last budget and the measures in this budget for increased practice incentives, increased payments for long consultations and case conferencing with other health professionals—such as allied health practitioners like podiatrists, diabetes educators and community nurses for someone with diabetes—will enable people, often with chronic multisystem illness, to access primary care. They will be bulk-billed and able to access the type of health care that they need rather than going from place to place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are very keen to improve access to primary care in rural areas. That's why there are rural practice incentives, and there are incentives for medical students to enter into rural training schemes by increasing the number of rural placements in universities—particularly with what was recently announced in the Northern Territory with their own clinical school. This will encourage people who attend those rural and regional training schemes to become doctors. They are much more likely to stay in rural and regional areas than if they are trained in city medical schools. So that's a great thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also making medicines much cheaper, with the freezing of the co-payment for medicines for four years for those on healthcare cards and for two years for those who are paying privately. This will make a difference together with our 60-day prescribing that we introduced earlier this year. It will make medicines much cheaper, particularly for older people, people on welfare payments and people with chronic illness. A very important part of our health infrastructure will be much cheaper for people to access with pharmacies et cetera. Our national immunisation programs have increased, with better access now to vaccines such as those for shingles and the recently available respiratory syncytial virus vaccine. They are all federally funded and available through pharmacies and general practitioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're investing in a future made in Australia. That has very important implications for the health system by encouraging local manufacturing of high-tech medical products and other products that provide good, well-paying jobs in the longer term for Australians. We've had many successes in Australia in the health field, but we've also had many losses to overseas manufacturing, such as the Gardasil vaccine for cervical cancer. But we've had many successes, like Cochlear and ResMed, and we need to build on that by using our Future Made in Australia funding to improve access for startup medical companies to manufacture in Australia. There are also now lots of supports for pharmaceutical manufacturing in Australia. As we speak, the multinational company Moderna is building a messenger RNA, or mRNA, production facility in Melbourne for things like mRNA vaccines and biological products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are really important things happening in medicine, and our government, through the health team led by Mark Butler, is doing really great things to try and make sure that people can access health care on an affordable and equitable basis wherever they live in Australia, after 10 years of complete neglect by the coalition government. We've had more interest in trying to reverse the trend of pressure on our public hospital outpatient system and emergency departments with the development of the urgent care centres, and these are now becoming more accessible in all parts of Australia. In my own electorate of Macarthur, we have the Macarthur urgent care centre, funded by the federal government, and we've got the urgent care centre funded by the state government in Gregory Hills. That is making a big difference and taking a lot of pressure off our hospital system, and I'm very grateful for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the terrible instances of violence against women, we're making much more progress through our initiatives to provide victim support funding and to make sure that people are able to leave violent situations by increasing the grants available to them to $5,000. There's much more to be done; I know that. It is a blight on our society that we have violence against women occurring on a regular basis in all areas of Australia and that many women are losing their lives every year due to this. The government is working hard to look at what solutions are available. It is something that governments of all persuasions in Australia are supporting, and I know the Attorney-General is very keen to see if there are supports that can be put in place through the legal system to make it more responsive to the needs of women in violent situations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are managing our economy responsibly. We're doing many things for people who suffer from disadvantage, and this is something that Labor governments have traditionally done. I'm particularly proud of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The recent announcement of a new specialist disability employment program will make a huge difference to many of the patients I've looked after in my electorate of Macarthur and even in the wider community. We've committed an additional sum of almost $230 million to this. That'll make people with disability more able to access jobs, and that makes a huge difference. I was recently in the restaurant at the Campbelltown Catholic Club, and I was served by a patient of mine with Down syndrome who, through our disability employment system, has been able to secure a full-time job working in hospitality in the club. They have been very supportive of disability employment in Macarthur, and this will make it easier for them to employ people with even moderately severe disabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're investing in a modern digital program to deliver better supports to people in the NDIS, and that has revolutionised the lives of not only people with disabilities but their families in Macarthur. It is very important that we focus on the NDIS and its support for people with disabilities and their families. We need to bring costs under control, and the minister is certainly doing that. But we are also focused on the fact that this has revolutionised the lives of such a large number of people with disability in our communities. It means that families know that their children and other family members with disabilities have certainty into the future on things like housing, employment and support as they grow older. We are rationalising NDIS funding, and it's important that we use an evidence base to rationalise the funding for supports for disability so that those with the most severe disabilities can be guaranteed ongoing supports in our community. We are also increasing efforts to address tax compliance in the shadow economy, in particular with that multinational tax avoidance, which will improve tax takes and the pool of spending that we can use in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm very excited about the budget. It's made a big difference to Macarthur residents, particularly in areas like the tax cuts, in education supports and in the wider community. I know there is much more to be done. There is certainly much more to be done in health, and access to primary care is a really important part of that. There are also improvements that will need to be made in providing supports for people who are falling outside safety nets in terms of housing policy. The government has committed $32 billion for that, and it will make a difference, but it takes time. We can't redress the 10 years of failed coalition policy in housing in one or two budgets. This will take a long time. But we will do it, and it can be done. I'm proud to be a member of a government that has delivered a really wonderful budget that will make a big difference to the future of Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300127" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WATSON-BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  There is no new money for housing, nothing for mortgage holders, no new money for DV support services and nothing to stop corporate price gouging. HECS debts will keep going up. The cost-of-living crisis will continue to get worse. But there is room for $50 billion for fossil fuel subsidies, $12 billion for nuclear submarines and $174 billion in tax handouts that make the housing crisis worse. This isn't a budget for everyday Australians; it's a budget for fossil fuel corporations and corporate CEOs that actually locks in the cost-of-living and climate crises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That $9.3 billion surplus that the Treasury is so proud of could have supplied thousands of public homes. It could have put dental cover into Medicare. It could have raised income support. It could be wiping HECS debt. It could fund years of free public transport across the entire country. But, no, it's more important that the Treasurer positions himself as sensible to the political and media class.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here are three—let's put it politely—untruths that Labor is telling you about their budget. Untruth No. 1: there is $11.3 billion in new money for housing in the budget—not true. Most of that is an extension of the Morrison-era agreement with the states. So it's not new money. The rest is the $1 billion that the Greens secured in negotiations last year on the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill, and the rest is for housing-adjacent infrastructure, not actually building new housing. Untruth No. 2: they're wiping $3 billion in HECS debt. This was debt that they created last year by refusing to scrap indexation, leading to debts massively climbing by 7.1 per cent. But we're expected to treat retroactively changing that indexation as some kind of incredible generosity. It's like pulling the knife out after they've stabbed you. Finally, untruth No. 3: this is a responsible budget. I'll tell you who it's being responsible for—the big banks, the CEOs and the fossil fuel corporations, who will keep benefiting from massive subsidies and tax breaks. It's not sensible or responsible for everyday people, who will continue to pay for those tax breaks and who will continue to suffer as the cost-of-living and climate crises get worse under this government. If they want to actually curb inflation, just cap rents and stop corporate price gouging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of bread is up over 20 per cent in the last two years. Cheese and eggs are up over 20 per cent. Oils are up almost 30 per cent over two years. Supermarket price gouging is out of control, and there is nothing—nothing—in Labor's budget to stop it. They're refusing to make price gouging illegal or to empower the ACCC to break up the duopoly. But when governments fail we know that our communities will still go out of their way to support each other. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our community pantry in Ryan has been open for nearly a year now, and, sadly, its use increases day by day. It now empties almost every day. My office and I provide the basics that we need, and we have generous donations from many Ryan locals. We've also just launched a very popular weekly free dinners program at two Ryan locations. People really appreciate meeting each other and taking a night off from cooking, and I really love catching up, too, in a friendly, informal family setting. Thanks again, amazing Ryan volunteers. You make this possible. I love your tireless work, but you really shouldn't have to be doing it. We need real action from our government to urgently alleviate desperate cost-of-living pressures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other dark pressures on too many in our community. Women are being murdered at almost twice the rate of last year—four women a week. The Prime Minister stood up at the No More rally in Canberra and said that his government would do more for prevention, more for cultural change that we so need and more to protect women. These seem like hollow words in the face of the government's budget that does nothing to address men's violence against women. It's offensive. It's a betrayal. Australia has an epidemic of men's violence against women. One in four women will have experienced violence since the age of 15, one in two have experienced sexual harassment, and 39 women have been murdered this year—I keep having to update that number every time I speak—but there is not a single new cent from Labor to fund frontline services that are so necessary. How many more women have to die for the government to actually do something useful and practical? What is the price that women have to keep on paying?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget could have funded support services, prevention programs, JobSeeker increases and crisis housing. Instead, there's money for fossil fuel subsidies and wealthy property investors, and nothing for women. If Labor were actually serious about this, if the condolences weren't hollow, they would actually commit to the immediate funding of legal aid—$1 billion for frontline support services every year and actual funding for prevention and education work. Anything less is a betrayal of women. The more Labor ignores this crisis, the more women are hurt and will die. There's no new funding for women or for real cost-of-living relief, and there's barely any spending on public schools. This is a budget for the likes of Brad Banducci, for Woodside and for property investors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you send your kid to a public school in Australia, you're getting pretty much nothing in this budget. Actually, what the Labor government will promise you is a funding shortfall of $3 billion for public education. What a disgrace. Less than two per cent of the public schools across Australia receive the funding they're supposed to get. Meanwhile, 98 per cent of private schools receive excess funding from the Labor government. It doesn't make any sense. This is actually harming our kids' futures. In my own electorate, for example, the Gap State School is shortchanged by $1 million a year, Ashgrove State School is shortchanged by $1.2 million annually, and Ferny Grove State High School has a funding shortfall of $3.5 million. Indooroopilly State High School can't even get any new funding to build toilets, despite overcrowding causing long lines every lunchtime. They've been refused any new permanent classrooms, and they're having to beg for demountables just so kids can have a library. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this budget, Labor are saying that they would rather buy nuclear submarines, weapons and fund climate bombs like the Middle Arm gas project than fund libraries, science lessons or toilets for our kids. They'll give huge handouts to private schools, fossil fuel companies and property investors but cry poor when it comes to funding our public schools and our kids' futures. It's an absolute betrayal of everyday people who are struggling to pay the mortgage, to fill up the car or to pay school fees. The Treasurer may pat himself on the back and congratulate himself for a job well done, but if he had actually been listening to real people in the community he would know that this budget has crushed people—people who had hoped that Labor might listen to them; that they might have had the weight of HECS debt lifted off their shoulders or that they might be able to afford a roof over their heads or feed their families without fear of defaulting on another bill. But, once again, Labor have decided to listen to their wealthy corporate mates and have left everyday Australians behind.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265990" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  The simple definition of DNA is: 'a molecule that contains the genetic code that is unique to every individual'. The code is, if you like, an instruction manual for making all the proteins that form our bodies and help us thrive. These codes or instruction manuals are, of course, genetic—handed from parent to child. It's true that the fruit never falls far from the tree, and we all inherit bits and pieces and odds and sods from our parents and grandparents. Often these are physical, but many are not. Miraculously, no two codes of DNA are the same. I've always loved science, and now I'm not sure whether this was inherited, an aspect of my DNA, or something I developed at school—and perhaps it was just a bit of both. But surely the discovery and the study of DNA is one of the greatest scientific advances of all time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Science, much like history, is debated, so the question of who discovered DNA is a vexed one. Was it a Swiss chemist? Was it others? There are many who claim that they discovered it. As for me, I'll settle for the Eagle pub theory—it suits Australian larrikinism, I think—for it was in this pub that Crick and Watson, on 28 February 1953, celebrated the discovery of the structure of DNA, the building block of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As DNA is to people, budgets are to governments. No two are the same; they're codes or building blocks; they're often inherited—in the case of budgets, through ideology or history—and they are all unique, cut and tailored to suit the demands, challenges and pressures of the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget handed down recently is very much in the tradition of Labor, and it is unmistakably Labor. So today, in this place, I would like to outline the evidence for this and to ask: How is this a Labor budget? And how is it tailored for our times? But I also want to touch on my particular electorate's DNA and on how the budget will assist my constituents specifically. I also want to touch on some non-economic pressures and the pain that my community is feeling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget leaves no Australian behind—not one. That is, every Australian taxpayer receives a tax cut. In Werriwa, this means that 80,000 taxpayers will, on average, get a tax cut of over $1,400. That's real money, in real pockets, from 1 July 2024, and it represents a significant increase on the tax cuts proposed by the previous government. In addition, we have increases to the Medicare levy low-income threshold, ensuring that more than one million low-income taxpayers continue to be exempt from the Medicare levy or pay a reduced rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Difficult economic times require a government to respond responsibly and appropriately. The new power-bill rebates do both. Again, no-one—I repeat: no-one—is left behind by the Albanese government, including small business, in these power rebates. Every household in Werriwa will receive a $300 rebate, applied quarterly, and small businesses will receive $325—real money, real assistance and real help with the cost of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Honestly, there's not enough time for me to detail all the cost-of-living measures in this budget. The billions for infrastructure in my part of south-western Sydney would take a speech in themselves. So, in this address on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2024-2025 and related bills, I'll restrict myself to just four measures that are particularly relevant to my constituents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, there's more assistance to help nearly one million Australian households with the cost of rent, by increasing the maximum rates of Commonwealth rent assistance by 10 per cent. This benefits over 9,000 households in Werriwa and builds on the government's 15 per cent increase, which commenced in September 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, this budget strengthens our healthcare system yet again. Members will remember the government's previous initiative in this area last year—namely, the establishment of urgent care clinics; cheaper medicines, through the 60-day scripts; and a historic $3.5 billion investment to triple the bulk billing incentive. This budget goes further by freezing the PBS co-payment and adding more medicines to the PBS. Residents in Werriwa have already saved over $1½ million thanks to our early reforms. Now everyone in Werriwa who has access to PBS medicines is set to save more. Further, we are expanding Medicare coverage to an MRI machine in Werriwa, which will expand affordable access to imaging services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third aspect of the budget I'd like to highlight relates to HECS relief for students. Many in my electorate are the first in their family to attend university, while others pursue alternative post-school educational opportunities. They know that solid education is a foundation for their future career and economic wellbeing. Labor has always been a friend of universities, beginning with Gough Whitlam's reforms all those years ago through to the Dawkins reforms a few years later. This budget makes the HECS-HELP system fairer. It does this by cutting $3 billion in student debt for more than three million Australians. Our government is doing this by capping the HELP indexation rate to the lower of either the CPI or the wage price index. This means HELP debts will never grow faster than wages. In Werriwa this change will support over 26,000 people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly and finally, there was one item in the recent budget that wasn't picked up by many. It's the additional $67.5 million as part of the government's second tranche of reforms to crack down on scammers. Surely all Australians have either been a victim of a scam or know someone who has been scammed. In all their iterations—SMS, emails, phone calls, doorknockers and the like—scams are everywhere. We all know this, but it only really gets driven home when we experience it personally. Recently I was scammed. The exact mechanism by which I was scammed is still a bit of a mystery, which in itself is a worry. Thankfully I was alerted in good time and, to the best of my ability, have taken every appropriate subsequent action. I'm not out of pocket, which, unfortunately, cannot be said for some of the constituents of Werriwa. A few months ago, I was very grateful for a visit to my office by the Assistant Treasurer. He led a well-attended and very informative scams forum. In 2023 Australians made more than 600,000 scam reports, and they lost up to $2.7 billion to scams. These are terrible statistics. The Albanese government takes scams seriously, and the announcement of additional funds in the budget will help my constituents keep ahead of the scammers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic and cost-of-living pressures that Australians are facing are real. Equally real are the relief measures in this budget. The measures in the budget are founded in our ideology and our DNA: to help those who need it, to offer a helping hand and to reward effort. As much as the economy and budgets are important, so are communities. I started today by talking about DNA. I refer to the physical traits we inherit from our forebears, but I also refer to other characteristics that are non-physical. For as much as we are all unique and individual, we have far more in common. The bond of humanity far exceeds our differences. We all feel pain, and we all feel joy. We all experience disappointment, and we hope for a better future. I rise today to talk about how my community has been hurting. It's only right that I speak not only about the economic pain but also about the shared heartbreak that many in my community are experiencing and continue to experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza. I don't say that lightly. Aid workers, journalists and innocent civilians have been killed, and the world is much poorer for their loss. There has been a massive swathe of destruction which has crippled existing infrastructure. The horror that we have seen is unfathomable and condemnable. The blocking of humanitarian assistance is unacceptable. To forget the suffering we have borne witness to would be deplorable. We must never forget how this most recent conflict began, nor the countless tragedies that have led to this moment. I mourn each of them. I mourn the good. I mourn the decent who have struggled for a peaceful future that they, sadly, have not now lived to see. I fear this cycle will not end until we resolve the perpetually unresolved issue: the recognition of the Palestinian state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government supports a two-state solution as the best possible path to ensuring peace and prosperity. Australia has voted to increase the participation of Palestine at the United Nations. We have voted for the cessation of hostilities. We've called for a ceasefire. We've called for humanitarian assistance. I've spoken and corresponded with many in my community. I share their sadness, their anguish and their frustration. I recognise their pain and will always endeavour to act on their behalf, with their best interests in mind. For as much as budgets and the economy and cost of living count—and they do—so do communities and people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will do everything in my remit and power to listen, to encourage and to foster tolerance, both on a one-on-one level with individuals and on the broader policy front. I will continue to engage with all those with faith and those with none. I will continue to recognise those in my community who give selflessly of themselves for the benefit of others. I will continue to walk towards harmony, mutual respect and tolerance, and more than anything I will continue to listen. Genuine listing is hard, but if we all try then it will make a difference. Everyone has a story and everyone needs to be heard. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I genuinely feel that this budget is a response to listening to the concerns of everyday Australians and that it is a step in the right direction in addressing the economic hurt so many are feeling. It has much more to offer all Australians and in its DNA it is authentically Labor. It is a budget I'm proud to defend. In the same way, I am proud of my community, my home electorate and its constituents. They've been through tough times, and I hope this budget will be a solid step for them in addressing their economic concerns. But more than that I also hope that, as a community in its full diversity, we can begin to address those other deeper, longing pains that are shared by so many—these pains that desire a better tomorrow, a more peaceful future and an end to war and division. The responsibility for addressing those pains lies with all of us. I commend the budget to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="299498" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOYCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  I rise to speak on the appropriation bills 2024-25. The Labor government's 2024-25 budget is a betrayal of regional Australia. Labor's budget has stripped away funding from nation-building infrastructure in regional Australia and failed to provide new money for regional programs, while refusing to fix its self-made cost-of-living crisis. Labor's decision to slash funding to restore Paradise Dam is a kick in the guts for not only the Bundaberg area but the agriculture industry as a whole. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been fighting for Paradise Dam to be restored for many years, and the Labor government's announcement is an enormous blow to our region. The Bundaberg area produces 25 per cent of Australia's fresh food produce, and hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in agriculture have now been put at risk due to the Albanese government's inexcusable decision to slash funding to restore the dam. I recently directed a question to the Prime Minister in question time. To make matters worse, Prime Minister Albanese deflected and, when he was asked about the restoration of Paradise Dam, treated the issue as if it was a laughing matter. The Prime Minister handballed the question to Minister Plibersek, who could not answer it and could not provide certainty to agriculture industries in the Wide Bay area. I invite Prime Minister Albanese and Minister Plibersek to come to the Flynn electorate and meet with the growers and the communities set to be affected by Labor's decision to cut funding to restore this critical piece of water infrastructure. Why is the Labor government breaking another promise to regional Australia? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, the aspiration of homeownership has become out of reach, and all migration records have been broken. Even finding somewhere to rent is near impossible in many regional areas. Amidst a housing crisis, Labor is bringing in a record 1.67 million immigrants over five years, but, on available data, it has only built 265,000 homes. While we celebrate the contribution of immigrants, our program needs to be well managed. Under the Prime Minister, the great Australian dream of homeownership has turned into a nightmare. His decisions have made the housing and rental crisis worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To alleviate pressure on the housing market, Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, and the coalition have announced a reduction in permanent migration from 185,000 to 140,000 for two years, and then 150,00 in year 3 and 160,000 in year 4; the return of the refugee and humanitarian program planning level to the long-term average, from 20,000 to 13,750; a reduction in the number of foreign students at metropolitan universities and an increase in the student visa fee, to be applied to foreign students who change providers; and the implementation of a two-year ban on foreign residents purchasing existing homes. By getting the migration setting right, the coalition will free up almost 40,000 additional homes in the first year and well over 100,000 homes in the next five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are still a lot of questions that need to be answered about Labor's Future Made in Australia Bill. This includes $13.7 billion in taxpayer funded subsidies for businesses, which doesn't address the source of Labor's cost-of-living and cost-of-doing-business crises. I'm a proud supporter of job creation in regional Australia, but I am of the firm belief that a successful industry should be able to stand on its own two feet. Eight billion dollars has been announced for hydrogen hubs across Australia, and I suspect Gladstone will be one of these sites, in my electorate of Flynn. The Gladstone Ports Corporation have publicly stated that a hydrogen industry at Gladstone will need 110 gigawatts of renewable energy to produce four million tonnes of hydrogen. This will require 10,000 wind turbines, 2½ thousand square kilometres of solar panels to be built and 45,000 megalitres of water each year. This requires over half the capacity of Rookwood Weir, near Rockhampton, to reach this target.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The things that I want to know are: How much money will be directed at the Gladstone renewable energy hub in respect of hydrogen? Where will all of these wind turbines go? Are they proposing to put them out in the Great Barrier Reef? Where will all the solar panels go—on prime agricultural land? Is this funding for hydrogen more money and subsidies for billionaires like Mr Forrest? Where will all the water come from for Gladstone's hydrogen industry? I say this as the Fitzroy to Gladstone pipeline will provide 19,000 megalitres of water for industry at Gladstone. Even with the unlikely possibility of the hydrogen industry receiving the full allocation, where is the remaining 26,000 megalitres of water going to come from? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been speculation that large-scale desalination plants could fill the void. According to the Water Corporation, of Western Australia, seawater desalination is four times more energy intensive than groundwater collection and over 40 times more energy intensive than water sourced from dams. The maths and the economics do not add up. So the economics tells us that the plan to use energy to convert seawater into freshwater and then use more energy to convert the water to hydrogen is a ridiculous notion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of addressing the causes of Labor's homegrown inflation, Labor is spending up to $315 billion—that's $30,000 of extra spending for every Australian household. Spending does not take pressure off inflation. In fact, it makes it worse, which will affect families across the Flynn electorate. Labor's focus should be on dealing with the high energy costs, high inflation and out-of-control red tape. Instead, Labor continually fails to address the fundamental realities facing most Australian businesses. The latest inflation data showed that, under Labor, prices across the board have risen close to 10 per cent and that the increase is even greater for many essential items. Food is up 10 per cent, housing is up 12 per cent, gas is up 25 per cent and electricity is up 18 per cent. Australians are poorer under this Albanese Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a risk that this spending will keep inflation higher for longer. While we support any help for families and small businesses with high energy costs, this rebate is a bandaid on a bullet wound. It doesn't change the fact that Australians still won't see the $275 reduction in their energy bills that the Prime Minister promised before the election. In fact, many Australians would need to see a $1,000 cut in their bill just to get the $275 reduction. As the shadow Treasurer said, Labor waste seems to know no bounds. They spent $450 million on the failed referendum that has divided this nation, spent billions on corporate welfare, provided funding for anti-resource project activists, spent more than $85 million for spin units in the Treasurer's department, created 36,000 additional Commonwealth Public Service jobs and had $45 billion in off-budget spending, which we have opposed. When Labor runs out of money, they come after yours, and it is little wonder that personal income taxes are now 23 per cent higher than when Labor came to office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition have made it clear that we will unequivocally and unashamedly champion our mining and resource sector. We will stand up for our gas industry, recognising the crucial role it plays in meeting our national energy goals. We will support our farmers, including ending any bans on live animal exports. Indeed, we will not turn our backs on industries that make this great country tick, as Labor has done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional telecommunications are critical for rural and regional Australia. I'm bewildered at the fact that the Labor government has abolished the Mobile Black Spot Program and provided no ongoing funding for other key regional communications infrastructure projects. Buried deep in the budget papers is the statement that funding for communications programs will fall, including 'the conclusion of the Mobile Black Spot Program'. The budget papers confirm that funding for the Mobile Black Spot Program ceases in 2026-27, with zero dollars allocated for 2027-28. Improving connectivity for people in the bush shouldn't be at the whim of the Albanese government's political strategy. The Minister for Communications needs to explain why she is abolishing the Mobile Black Spot Program while failing to provide long-term funding for other mobile connectivity programs that so many Australians rely on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that the Labor government has heard my calls for change to the HECS debt system loud and clear. The changes will mean that if your student loan was indexed on 1 June 2023 you will receive a credit on your Higher Education Loan Program or other student loan account. This was needed because a higher-than-usual CPI resulted in an indexation rate of 7.1 per cent when applied to student loans on 1 June 2023. The government is proposing a retrospective change to reduce the indexation rate from 1 June 2023 to 3.2 per cent. This means you'll automatically be credited the difference on your student loan account. This will be welcomed by students across the Flynn electorate and by over three million students with HECS debts across Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the few positives that I've seen in the budget is the continuation of the $20,000 instant asset write-off until 30 June 2025. However, I would like to see the instant asset write-off increased to unlock investment and create more jobs, particularly in rural and regional Australia. I strongly welcome Peter Dutton's announcement that the future coalition will extend the value of the assets eligible for the instant asset write-off to $30,000 and make this ongoing for small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also welcome the $11.6 million over two years from 2024-25 to continue support for men's sheds and existing national men's health research and data collection initiatives, in line with the National Men's Health Strategy 2020-2030. Men's sheds play a vital role in preventing social isolation and mental ill-health. They offer thousands of men of all ages a safe and friendly environment where they can work on meaningful projects while building strong social connections. So I'm sure this funding will be well received.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also agree with the following government initiatives: the $3.4 billion addition of life-changing and life-saving medicines to the PBS; $1 billion towards accommodation for women and children fleeing domestic violence; and $925 million for a leaving-violence program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reiterate Peter Dutton's plan to get Australia back on track. As Peter Dutton explains, first we will rein in inflationary spending to take the pressure off inflation. As a start, we will not spend $13.7 billion on corporate welfare for green hydrogen and critical minerals. Second, we will wind back Labor's intervention and remove regulatory roadblocks which are suffocating the economy and stopping businesses from getting ahead. We will condense approvals processes and cut back on Labor's red tape, which is killing mining jobs and entrepreneurialism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, we will remove the complexity and hostility of Labor's industrial relations agenda, which is putting unreasonable burdens on businesses. For example, we will revert to the former coalition government's simple definition of 'casual worker' and create certainty for our 2.5 million small businesses. Fourth, we will provide lower, simpler, and fairer taxes for all, because Australians should keep more of what they earn. Fifth, we will deliver competition policy which gives consumers and small businesses a fair go, not lobbyists and big corporations. And, sixth, we will ensure that Australians have more affordable and reliable energy. Our economic plan is based on tried and tested principles and will restore competitiveness and rebuild the economy with confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is pressing ahead with its new fresh food tax. It's called a biosecurity protection levy. The fresh food tax is disorganised, shambolic and a terrible idea that is not even likely to work. There are 84 agricultural commodities set to be taxed to raise around $150 million over three years. Food costs will continue to climb, because Labor is refusing to reinstate the ag visa. Instead, it's introducing just $1 million in its budget for a skilled agricultural work liaison pilot to attract graduates to work in agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, regional Australia has been betrayed in Labor's budget. Sadly, it is clear that Labor has no plan to fix the cost-of-living crisis for regional families, and they will feel the pain in their wallets. Under Labor, regional Australia is the poorer for being hit with higher taxes, higher mortgage payments and higher grocery and energy bills. This is an inflationary budget that has no incentive for productivity whatsoever.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="299964" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FERNANDO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  This month the Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, delivered his third budget. This budget is one that truly delivers for Australian families and sets out a vision for our nation's future. As a representative for the people of Holt, it is my duty to advocate for policies that alleviate the burdens faced by families, particularly in the outer south-east of Melbourne, where the challenges are keenly felt. We all know that families are doing it tough, and that is why Labor is working very hard to support them. This budget builds on our plan to support families and address the cost of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, we delivered $23 billion in cost-of-living relief, fee-free TAFE, more affordable housing, cheaper medicines, cheaper child care, more bulk-billing, expanding paid parental leave, creating jobs and getting wages moving again. Building on our existing cost-of-living relief, Labor's stage 3 tax cuts represent the next step in this plan. Ninety per cent of taxpayers in my electorate of Holt will get a larger tax cut than they would have under the coalition—from fast food workers in Cranbourne to IT professionals in Clyde and from my former colleagues at Woolworths to migrants, like my parents, who have journeyed to our shores. Only the Labor Party stands up for Australians who are doing it tough, and these changes are proof of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan will give all 13.6 million taxpayers a tax cut. This includes minimum wage and part-time workers, like many of our nation's youth. These workers—I used to be one—received no support under the coalition's plan. This is the difference between Labor and the coalition. In Holt, where families are feeling the pinch of skyrocketing living expenses, these tax cuts will make a difference. For instance, a minimum-wage worker on $45,000 a year will be $800 better off under Labor's tax cuts. With the average tax cut for a resident of Holt being $1,320, this will offer significant relief to families. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also providing energy bill relief for 10 million households, who will receive $300 off their power bill over 2024-25. This is on top of the expected six per cent decrease in the price of the default market offer in Victoria, saving Victorian families a further $100 across the year. This will help families keep the lights on, and it will put downward pressure on inflation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget we are addressing one of the most pressing issues facing Australians today—affordable housing. The Albanese government is increasing Commonwealth rent assistance by 10 per cent to provide much-needed relief to renters. This increase will mean that Commonwealth rent assistance has increased by 43 per cent since we came into government, reflecting our commitment to ensuring that every Australian has access to safe and affordable housing. For many families in Holt and across this nation, rent is the largest single expense. The rising cost of living has made it increasingly difficult for low-income households to keep up with the rent payments, pushing many into financial stress and housing insecurity. By increasing Commonwealth rent assistance we are directly reducing the financial burden on renters, ensuring that more Australians can afford to stay in their own homes. This increase will benefit 6,000 residents in my electorate of Holt, providing them with an additional layer of financial support. From a single mum in Hampton Park to a pensioner in Cranbourne or an apprentice in Tooradin, this will make a tangible difference for those who are struggling the most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is making significant strides to address the housing crisis by boosting the supply of homes across Australia. In this bill, we are committing an additional $6.2 billion, bringing the government's total housing investment to over $32 billion. This substantial funding will support the construction of more homes, ensuring that every Australian has access to safe and affordable housing. We are allocating $3.5 billion to accelerate the building of new homes by funding essential infrastructure such as roads, services, sewers and parks. This is crucial for developing new housing projects in areas like Clyde, Botanic Ridge and Cranbourne West, where the infrastructure has been slow to catch up to new developments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, we are creating 20,000 new fee-free TAFE places, focusing on construction courses to address labour shortages and speed up housing development. Most importantly, the government is investing to support women and children fleeing domestic violence, with $1 billion for projects that support them to find a safe place to call home. This investment ensures that our housing strategy is inclusive and meets the needs of all Australians. This investment shows our commitment towards our target to build 1.2 million homes by 2029, as agreed with the states in the National Housing Accord.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we stand at the crossroads in Australia's economic history—one marked by the consequences of policy decisions that have undermined our manufacturing sector. A decade of neglect and short-sighted policies under the Liberal governments has led to the demise of national institutions such as our car-manufacturing industry. Instead of fostering local businesses, the Liberals chose to prioritise cheap imports over domestic production, sacrificing the livelihoods of hardworking Australians in the process. As we look to the future, it is imperative that we chart a new course: one that prioritises local industry and puts the needs of our communities first.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is steadfast in its commitment to build a future made in Australia. We are building a future where Australian ideas and industries thrive, benefiting every Australian and securing our place in the global economy. Labor's vision is anchored in our $22.7 billion plan, designed to unlock the full potential of our resources, transforming Australia into a manufacturing superpower. Our plan encompasses a bold agenda to drive innovation and industry growth, establishing Australia as a global hub for cutting-edge technology. With initiatives like the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund, the Hydrogen Headstart program, the Battery Breakthrough Initiative and Solar Sunshot, we are investing in breakthrough technologies that will revolutionise our industry. Moreover, we are building resilient supply chains and fostering collaborations between industry and academia to drive research and development. This isn't just about securing our economic future; it's about shaping a future where Australian innovation and creativity are celebrated on the world stage. In this future made in Australia, we see a nation that leads by example, a nation that not only meets the challenges of the 21st century but thrives in the face of adversity. It is a future where every Australian has the opportunity to succeed, where innovation flourishes and where sustainability is at the core of everything that we do. Labor embraces this vision. We are working tirelessly to make it a reality. This is a future made in Australia for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Higher education is vital to any future made in Australia. Our higher education sector is one of our national assets and contributes immensely to our national wealth. To transform our economy, we must continue to invest and expand the reach of our higher education system so that those from disadvantaged backgrounds and those from the outer suburbs can attend. The Liberals ran a crusade against the higher education sector, with cut after cut each budget and attempt after attempt to make students pay thousands more for their degrees. After a decade of attacks on our universities by the Liberals, it is exciting to see a Labor government which is supporting our students across many fields.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Students must undertake hundreds of hours of unpaid work placements to finish their degrees. I know that taking hundreds of hours of unpaid work to do placements is difficult, especially with today's cost-of-living pressures. That is why we have announced that, from July 2025, students studying nursing, teaching, social work and midwifery will be paid $319.50 per week while undertaking their placements. These are vital industries for the future of our nation. They also have some of the fastest-growing demands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Studying at university shouldn't burden a person with a lifetime of debt. Last year, we saw student loans increase at some of the fastest rates in history, and, if we didn't act, we would have seen a historically large increase again this year. This rapid rise in debt threatens to discourage young Australians from studying. This is why Labor is changing the indexation of loans in this budget, so that student loans will never increase faster than their wages. This change will wipe $3 billion in student debt for three million Australians. We are investing $350 million in fee-free uni-ready courses so that more students have a pathway to higher education, with a focus on students from underrepresented backgrounds. The funding will replace the current mixed funding system with consistent funding to deliver higher-quality courses. This will result in 30,000 students studying in fee-free uni-ready courses each year by 2030, an increase of 40 per cent in student numbers and doubling the numbers of students by 2040.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are continuing our work to strengthen Medicare so that all Australians have access to health care they need. We are investing $2.8 billion to enhance Medicare, including more urgent care clinics, higher rebates for common tests and improved women's health services. In Holt, Labor's investments have led to an additional 1,577 bulk-billed GP visits since November 2023, showing our commitment to make health care more accessible. Labor is also expanding Medicare urgent care clinics to 29 new sites nationwide, ensuring more Australians can benefit from bulk-billed walk-in urgent care. Moreover, we are bringing an MRI machine to Holt and ensuring that pathology tests remain bulk-billed, reducing wait times and catching health problems sooner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With one-quarter of my electorate being under 14 years of age, youth mental health is one of the top issues in Holt. Treating issues while kids are young is vital to ensure they start off life on a founding footing. Labor is investing $361 million to establish a free online mental health service to expand access to care. This means any Australian can access the mental health care they need at any time from the comfort of their bedroom. These initiatives demonstrate our dedication to a stronger, more accessible healthcare system for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is a responsible budget that delivers for Australian families. This is a budget that delivers on our core priorities of cost of living, housing, health care and education. This is a budget with a vision for the future of our nation. This budget will drive down inflation. This budget has delivered back-to-back surpluses for the first time in 20 years. I would like to thank the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, for their work on this bill, and I commend the budget to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  According to the Treasurer, Labor's budget 'is realistic about the pressures people face now', and apparently it's 'a budget for every Australian'. What self-serving rubbish! This isn't a budget which is realistic about the pressures that people face. It's not a budget for everyone. This is a budget that does just enough so that Labor can say that they understand the challenges that people are facing while continuing the special treatment for big corporations and wealthy property investors. This is a budget that puts people under more pressure. Under Labor, cost of living's up, rents are up, food prices are up and climate pollution is up, because this is a government that is more concerned with the big corporations and their profits. They're more concerned about the stock exchange than ensuring that everyone has a roof over their head or enough to eat. They're more concerned about CEOs' pay than workers' pay. To many people, Labor's so-called answers are just plain offensive. They're glib talking points, weasel words designed to allow Labor to say that they're listening and that they're a bit better than the Liberals, but in reality the problems people face keep getting worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor said that in this budget they're delivering cost-of-living relief, but a few hundred dollars off your power bill won't stop the international gas cartel making billions of dollars while driving up prices. A tiny chop-out for the fraction of people who are on rent assistance won't help the majority of those in the country who rent. The student debt indexation changes won't deliver cost-of-living relief to people now, when they need it, and people will still get stuck with completely unaffordable degrees. Saying that things like giving rent assistance to people will help when most of the renters don't even get it is exactly why people are losing faith in the major parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor say they're realistic, but what's realistic about spending $342 billion on nuclear submarines when 3.3 million people are living in poverty under the worst support payments in the OECD? What's realistic about spending $50 billion on fossil fuel subsidies in a climate crisis while not spending a single extra cent on underfunded frontline services for women escaping violence? What's realistic about banking a $9.3 billion surplus when every one of those dollars could help people who are now living below the poverty line in this wealthy country of ours? None of this is realistic. It is deeply unrealistic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Millions of people are trapped in a pressure cooker, and Labor is turbocharging inequality. The rent keeps going up, food prices keep going up, power bills keep going up, health costs keep going up and, despite working harder and harder, people are going backwards. Labor ignored these real concerns. They refused a rent freeze. They won't take on the wealthy property investors, and most of their MPs are property investors. They won't take on the big supermarkets and make price gouging illegal. They let big banks push up mortgage rates to slow down the economy while completely ignoring the big banks' massive profits that they're making off the back of people's pain. And now everyday people are paying the price. Parents are skipping meals so that their kids can eat. People are going hungry just to be able to pay the rent. And instead of ensuring that everyone has enough to eat or a roof over their head, Labor is spending billions of dollars on nuclear-powered submarines.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you one sure-fire way to make the problem worse: ignore expert advice. The government's own expert advisory body told them to raise JobSeeker by $17 a day, but Labor refused because apparently they know better. The parliamentary inquiry into supermarket prices, which heard from experts, farmers, economists from around the country, told the government we need to make price gouging illegal and break up the duopoly. But the Prime Minister apparently knows better, saying:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we do, Prime Minister, we do, and it's working exactly as the designers intended. We have a command-and-control economy, where the big corporations say 'jump' and Labor says 'how high?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and the Liberals have created an economy for the big corporations which preys on people for profit. They have created an economy where the share which goes to working people has never been lower and the share which goes to corporate profits and billionaires has never been higher. They have created an economy where one in three big corporations pays no tax! When a nurse pays more tax than a multinational something is deeply wrong. They have created an economy where the government is no longer in command and can't control the big corporations, but rather is at the mercy of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor there are fewer people in unions than ever before, more people living in tents and real wage growth just isn't keeping up. Labor has overseen an economy where billions of dollars of government services is spent on big consulting firms; where public housing is sold off; where energy, telecommunications, water and every other public service that you can think of gets privatised; where already wealthy private schools get overfunded, but public schools have to fight for every scrap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor says it's realistic about the pressures that people face. Well, why won't Labor stop increasing the pressure? Labor could reduce the pressure for a single mother couch surfing with her kids or facing the pressure of wondering whether the card's going to go through at the checkout. People's problems are caused by these big corporations, these wealthy property developers making massive profits from essential services like food and housing, but Labor can't even bring themselves to say that these big corporations are to blame. They blame supply chains and the global situation. They said the cost of living is moderating, but 'not as fast as we would like', but they never say a word about the price gouging or the profiteering of these big corporations, about the people who are charging too much for the things that we all need. How can you fix a problem that you can't even name? What we need is an economy that works for people. People need representatives who are going to fight for them, not fight for the big corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is more concerned with the future of coal and gas corporations and their massive profits than they are about the climate crisis or the cost of the gas that they sell us. For years we've known Labor, together with the Liberals, have been fully owned entities of the coal and gas corporations. Just look at how many frontbenchers, how many ministers leave this place to go and work in the coal and gas industries. Pretty much every former energy minister in this country now works for coal and gas corporations or their lobby groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor takes millions in donations from the coal and gas corporations. The one time that Labor, under Kevin Rudd, tried to make the coal and gas industry pay a fairer share of tax, the mining industry and its big lobby groups mobilised a massive campaign that saw Kevin Rudd turfed from office. It was a campaign which cost the industry millions and made them billions. Now, Labor does whatever the gas corporations want. That's what the Prime Minister means when he says this is a private sector economy in Australia. It's why students paying for their university education deliver more to the public purse than the entire gas industry does through the gas tax. It's why giant corporations like Woodside and Santos get the go-ahead to trample the land and water rights of First Nations communities, even though the Prime Minister wants to be remembered as a champion of the Indigenous people of this country. It's why Labor is backing climate bombs like the Scarborough gas field and the Beetaloo basin—and backing them with the public's money. The most recent budget has billions of dollars of your money going to coal, gas and oil corporations, the same companies who are causing the climate crisis. Labor's new policy, a Future Made in Australia, is a future for coal and gas past 2050, when they told us that we were meant to be at zero emissions. They're now saying it'll go past 2050. You can't put your foot on the brakes and the accelerator at the same time and expect to go anywhere. When Scott Morrison announced the gas led recovery, he was rightly mocked, but this is the same plan now. It's why so many people are telling me that it is getting harder and harder to tell Labor and the Liberals apart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Gas is one of the leading causes of the climate crisis. Australia is one of the biggest producers of gas pollution. Gas is not safe. Gas is as dirty as coal. It's not renewable. It's deadly, and it's massively expensive. It's going to cause more floods, more fires, more droughts and more diseases. It is going to smash people's future, all for the profits of these big corporations—profits which are largely sent offshore, tax free. Labor's plan is to back gas all the way until 2050 and beyond. The concerns from Labor backbenchers, like the member for Macnamara, have been licensed by the government because those seats are under pressure from the Greens, but, when it comes to parliament, those members all line up to vote to back new coal and gas mines in the middle of a climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's not even using this gas to lower the power prices for people struggling here. The whole strategy is about protecting the profits of big gas corporations, not reducing power prices or emissions. Eighty per cent of this gas gets sent overseas. The biggest user of gas in this country, the biggest source, is the gas industry itself. They use more than all of the manufacturing in Australia put together. That's what this gas strategy is about: propping up the big corporations and the massive profits that they pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We rank, together with Russia and Saudi Arabia, in the top three exporters of fossil fuel pollution. That is not a podium that you want to be on, but that is a podium that Labor puts us on. In the middle of a climate crisis, Labor is opening more coal and gas mines. You can't tackle the problem while you're making the problem worse. You can't put the fire out while you're pouring petrol on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is also clear is this: Labor is running the economy for the profits of big corporations, and it's selling off the future of generations to come. The Prime Minister, as he loves to tell us, grew up in public housing as the son to a single parent, to now become the most powerful person in the country. Now a family in a similar situation would face the risk of hunger, homelessness and poverty. When the Prime Minister was 21, university was free. You could see a doctor for free. You could buy a home on an average worker's wage. Working people didn't have to choose between having kids and buying a home. Now, 40 years later, the country is in a much different position. Going to university will saddle you with debt for decades, you will need to save for decades to have enough for a deposit to buy a home, you won't be able to see a doctor for free, food and power are more expensive than ever, and you'll face a growing climate crisis. All of this is because we have an economy that is working for the big corporations but not working for everyday people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decisions made by the Liberals and Labor over the last 40 years have made growing up today much harder than it needs to be. They have grown the profits and the power of the big corporations across the economy, whether it's the big banks, the big supermarkets, the big power companies or the big gas corporations. But the share of the economy that goes to working people and everyone else is at a record low. We know that corporate profits and their excessive price gouging are driving the cost of living and the climate crisis. We know that the cost of living and the climate crisis will hit gen Z and future generations the hardest. We know that they are the first generations in peacetime that face a declining living standard and a declining level of homeownership, and they are, rightly, pretty worried.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The price of housing is the clearest example. Homeownership was once a defining feature of life in this country, but now it is simply out of reach of a whole class of people. Renters are now worried about being thrown out onto the streets. Nurses and teachers aren't able to find properties near the hospitals or schools where they work, forcing them to travel for hours just to get to work. Young people are living for longer with their parents, and tent cities are springing up across the country. In a wealthy country like Australia, where on last census night a million homes were vacant, this is outrageous. Meanwhile we have this race to the bottom where they seek to blame migrants and say that that is somehow the problem. They are not the people who have caused this problem. The competition for a renter when they turn up to an auction is a wealthy property developer who has a big fat cheque in their pocket courtesy of Labor and who is able to push the price of housing out of reach of people in this country. In a wealthy country like ours, no-one should go without. It's time to fix this broken system.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  My community of Bennelong is just like many across Australia. We are a community that faces the very real consequences of a decade of inaction on housing, underinvestment in infrastructure and a lack of care for the environment, whilst we also navigate the cost-of-living pressures posed by global economic turmoil, inflation and rising costs of living. Recognising this, our government has made easing cost-of-living pressures its top priority in this year's budget. This budget shows a clear intent by the government that we acknowledge that many are doing it tough and that everyone needs support to deal with cost-of-living pressures. This budget is good for Australia and it's good for Bennelong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, this budget provides every taxpayer with a tax cut, directly putting more money back into the pockets of 92,000 taxpayers in Bennelong. Additionally, every household will receive a $300 energy rebate—much-needed relief as energy prices remain high. We are also investing significantly in our local infrastructure. There has been $115 million allocated for New South Wales's first electric-only bus depot in Macquarie Park and an additional $10 million for the Macquarie Park Precinct and Bus Interchange. Further, over $25 million will be dedicated to upgrading local roads, ensuring safer and more efficient travel for all of our residents. In health care, we are committed to making essential services more accessible to everybody. A Medicare urgent care clinic in Top Ryde—Bennelong's first—will provide critical healthcare services closer to home, and publicly funded MRIs will be available to locals for the first time from 1 July 2025 in Bennelong. This will ensure that everyone in Bennelong has universal and bulk-billed access to these important services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, this budget adds more funding to address the housing crisis we face, with an extra $6 billion in new measures to build homes across Australia, helping first home buyers and renters in Bennelong find secure and affordable housing. That's a total of $32 billion in funding for housing to address a decade of housing inaction by those opposite. In Bennelong, 23,805 students will benefit from the government's HECS and HELP reforms, making education more affordable and accessible, and wiping $3 billion in student loan debt across Australia. This year's budget is a comprehensive plan that provides immediate relief and long-term investments to strengthen our community, our economy and our nation. From tax cuts and energy rebates to significant infrastructure projects and improved healthcare services, this budget is designed to address the pressing needs of our economy and ensure a better future for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take the opportunity to go a little deeper into some of the measures in this budget that people in Bennelong care about, starting with housing. We all know that a secure and affordable home is a cornerstone of a stable and prosperous society. Housing is something I've cared about, and advocated for, for a long time during my decade in public life. I was proud to stand as a candidate for Bennelong in 2022 because I knew that our government was going to do something about the housing crisis. This budget continues on the monumental work we've done to date, but I also acknowledge that there is much more to do. As mentioned, more than $6 billion in new housing measures have been allocated through this year's budget, bringing the government's total investment in housing initiatives over the next decade to $32 billion. These investments will increase market and non-market housing supply. They'll support homebuyers and renters and provide assistance to our most vulnerable citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Breaking down this allocation, we are first and foremost allocating $1 billion to infrastructure projects to accelerate the construction of new homes. This funding will go to states to provide this essential infrastructure, including roads, utilities and parks, which are crucial for additional housing supply. We are also committed to providing more social and affordable rental housing. To this end, we are increasing the liability cap of Housing Australia by $2½ billion and providing an additional $3 billion in loans to support ongoing programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising the need for a skilled workforce to build these homes, we are creating 15,000 fee-free TAFE places and 5,000 pre-apprenticeship programs specifically for the construction industry. This initiative will ensure that we have the workers required in order to build the homes that we need. Moreover, we are unlocking up to $1 billion through the National Housing Infrastructure Facility to create more homes, particularly focusing on housing for women and children who are fleeing domestic violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are increasing the maximum rates of Commonwealth rent assistance by 10 per cent, on top of the 15 per cent increase last year, to further help one million households with the cost of rent. This measure is costed at $1.9 billion. We are also doubling Commonwealth funding for homelessness support and building more social housing through the new $9.3 billion National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness, with an additional $423 million in funding. Additionally, we are dedicating more than $100 million to build more transitional housing for women and children who are impacted by family and domestic violence and older women who are at risk of homelessness. Finally, we're providing $30 million to support veterans who are experiencing or are at risk of homelessness. Our veterans have served our nation, and it's our duty to ensure that they have a safe place to call home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These new measures build on our comprehensive Homes for Australia plan. Through the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund and the $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator, progress has been made. We understand the critical role that housing plays in our lives, and we are dedicated to ensuring that everyone has access to safe, secure and affordable housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, whilst housing remains a cornerstone of this budget, we must also take action to tackle the broader cost-of-living challenges that impact every household. Our government recognises the financial pressures that families, students and small businesses face every day. It was with this understanding that we presented a budget designed to ease these pressures and provide tangible relief to all Australians, not just some.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 July the Albanese Labor government will deliver a significant tax cut for every single taxpayer. That's 13.6 million Australians who'll get a tax cut—not just some but everyone. And we changed those tax cuts to ensure that they help those who need it most. These cuts are aimed squarely at middle-income earners and those who've been telling me that they need support. For example, a part-time worker on $40,000 would have got nothing under the Liberals' plan—nothing. Under this budget and this government, they'll get a tax cut of $654 a year—$0 under the Liberals, $654 under Labor. That's 2.9 million taxpayers who earn $45,000 or less. They will get a tax cut because of this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just tax cuts that will help with cost-of-living relief. Our government is allocating a further $3½ billion for energy bill relief starting on 1 July. We know that last year the Liberals and Nationals voted against energy bill relief. Last year's relief was targeted, as it should have been; that was right for the time. But locals in Bennelong over the last year have been telling me that they need energy relief too. In this budget we have energy relief for everyone. More than 10 million households will get a $300 rebate on their energy bills, while one million eligible small businesses will receive a $325 rebate. And this time there'll be no applications. You don't need to fill out forms; you don't need to apply for it. It will automatically be applied to the household's and small business's energy bill. The rebates from 1 July will be simple, universal and much needed by every household in Bennelong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On energy, it is great to see that this budget reaffirms our commitment to renewable energy and that renewable energy is paying off. Wholesale electricity prices in the electricity market have fallen by eight per cent in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same time last year. This decrease is a direct result of our efforts to increase the share of renewable energy, aiming for an 82 per cent renewable energy target by 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Very recently, the Energy Market Operator released its default market offer for 1 July, which will see energy prices for small businesses in New South Wales fall by eight per cent and for households by 2½ per cent. But there's more to do, and that's why this budget delivers billions and billions of dollars for the environment and not one cent of new money for gas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to another topic: education. Education should be a pathway to opportunity and not a lifetime of debt. That's why our government is cutting $3 billion from student debt for over three million Australians. We are capping the HELP indexation rate to the lower of either the consumer price index or the wage price, backdated to 2023. This means HELP debts will never grow faster than wages and will provide much-needed relief to students nationwide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health care is another critical area in which we are making substantial investment in this budget. There is nearly $4 billion allocated to make medicines more affordable by freezing the PBS copayment and by adding more medicines to the PBS. We have already saved residents in Bennelong over $2.4 million. For the next five years pensioners and concession cardholders will not pay more than $7.70 for PBS medicines, ensuring our most vulnerable citizens can access the medications they need without extra financial pressure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporting families is at the heart of our policies as well. From 1 July 2025 we will pay superannuation on government funded paid parental leave, an investment of $1.1 billion over four years. This measure will benefit 180,000 families annually and help reduce the retirement income disparity between men and women, who currently retire with 25 per cent less superannuation than men.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget lays a strong foundation for a future made in Australia, ensuring that our nation remains resilient, innovative and self-sufficient. We will invest heavily in the manufacturing sector, allocating $2 billion to the National Reconstruction Fund designed to support the development of critical technologies and industries, which will create jobs and foster innovation. Instead of chasing out manufacturers like the Liberals did, we will invest in them. We are prioritising sectors such as renewable energy, advanced manufacturing and critical minerals processing, which are not only essential for our transitional to a low-carbon economy but also essential to the world's transition to a low-carbon economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget lays a strong foundation for addressing the key issues facing our community and our nation by focusing on immediate relief through tax cuts and energy rebates, and by adding significant investments in housing and infrastructure, essential services and health care. By looking towards the future, a future made in Australia, we are taking concrete steps to improve the lives of our residents. This is a budget I endorse and it's a big and good budget for Bennelong.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWN" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  I think this might be my 16th or 17th budget appropriations speech. I have been listening with interest to some of the previous speeches and I just want to start by issuing a warning to the government and my colleagues in the opposition. I won't be here at the next election; I am retiring. I think the speeches made by the Greens members in this appropriation speech should be sent to every household in Australia. They are absolutely terrifying contributions, because if there is a hung parliament next time and the Greens get the balance of power, this country will be in a world of pain. I was listening to the member for Melbourne, the Greens leader, as he was admonishing coal and gas. He lives in an electorate that is completely altered. I've been there at night-time. They don't even turn their lights off in those office towers when they go home. It's an electorate that relies on the resources industry not only for its construction but also for its maintenance, and then to attack the very hand that feeds it—it is terrifying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should mention the irony in some of the previous contributions. The member for Melbourne talked about his concern for the Indigenous people. What about the 250 Aboriginal people who work for Whitehaven Coal at Narrabri? What about them? They would take their jobs away—good-paying jobs that support their families. Just a word of warning: the Greens are a very dangerous organisation. They're not environmentalists, and if they get any more influence in this country than they already have then we're in serious trouble. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I found interesting is the fact that this budget was quite narrowly focused. There was a lot of money for green hydrogen and not much else. There was some for other renewables, but the main focus was green hydrogen. Now, I actually believe that there will be a future for hydrogen, but at the moment it's an experimental fuel. There are a lot of issues around hydrogen, particularly green hydrogen, that have yet to be overcome—issues around transportation, the amount of water that it uses and, if it's going to be green hydrogen, the amount of renewable energy it takes to produce it. At the moment they don't stack up. Like it or not, in this country we are still reliant on traditional fuels to generate power. Whether the member for Melbourne or those opposite that admonish gas and coal like it or not, that's what is keeping the lights on in their houses at the moment. We don't live in a parallel universe where by wishing something it can happen. We live in the real world where we actually have to look after the industries that support us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate, the Parkes electorate, helped carry this country through the pandemic. It produces large quantities of clean agricultural produce, food and fibre. It produces minerals, coal, gold, copper, lead, zinc. Soon it will be at the forefront of rare earths and those minerals that are so important for modern technology. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think I should start by recognising what I appreciate in this budget under the Growing Regions Program. I should acknowledge the payments that came to my electorate for the Moree pool; for a Brewarrina PCYC and an indoor stadium—Brewarrina is a very good strong community on the Barwon River in my electorate, and this will be a wonderful proposal for them—and for the Gunida Gunyah Aboriginal Corporation in Gunnedah, for their community centre; they do a great job helping people in that area. In Dubbo the Wiradjuri cultural centre will be a great facility for the Wiradjuri people and the broader Dubbo community. It will not only be a keeping place and an important place for the Wiradjuri people; it will be an opportunity for visitors to the area to get an understanding of the Wiradjuri culture. I congratulate the Dubbo council for that. There's also the Narrabri tourism project. Once again, Narrabri is a very strong community, and having that addition to their tourism precinct, adjacent to the Crossing Theatre, will be of great benefit to them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened to the member for Bennelong's contribution. He spoke about all of the issues with health and the additional spending. My electorate is still reeling from the changes to the DPA, the distribution priority area, which was the incentive that took doctors to regional Australia. The first thing this government did was change that, and it decided to classify peri-urban areas like Wollongong, Newcastle and Geelong—and probably some areas in Deputy Speaker Wilkie's electorate as well—as regional. When that happened, western health lost six doctors in one week. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of concern for regional Australia, and areas like mine, is absolutely breathtaking. We talk about this government wasting millions of dollars and splitting the country on a proposal for a voice that was ill thought out and not wanted, and I've heard speech after speech in this place about their care for Aboriginal people, yet time after time the projects that are important to those people get ripped out. At the moment I'm dealing with the weir at Wilcannia, where people were promised a weir that would raise the river by two metres, but it got packed back to one metre. So, while we care for Aboriginal people in this place, something that would really make a difference to that community—something that they really wanted and that the land council and everyone was behind—got cut back. That's the frustrating thing about the hypocrisy in this place. This place is like a university debating room where we talk about our virtue but nothing equates to what happens on the ground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A great example is the Inland Rail north of Narromine. People in my electorate—not wealthy people but entrepreneurial battlers—saw the potential of the Inland Rail construction, went to the bank, borrowed money and bought trucks and excavators. Aboriginal people in Moree undertook training. They were working on that first section—Narrabri to Moree and Moree to North Star—and that all just got ripped out. I talked to a young fella the other day; he had to sell his truck and he's had to go and get a job because the work stopped.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the work on the Newell Highway now, the $250-odd million is still money that was allocated from the previous government. The Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program has been cut. With the Stronger Communities Program, there was just $150,000 to each electorate, which helped the local CWA hall maybe upgrade to a safety ramp or which got a barbecue for the Lions Club or some nets for the tennis club. Little things like that just got ripped out. Roads of strategic importance, where roads that would link onto the Newell Highway and help the productivity of the local area—gone. LRCI, one of the most popular projects with local government—gone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're seeing now is ministers from this government coming into electorates like mine to cut the ribbons of projects that they can—projects that they are taking credit for but that they didn't fund or construct. Just the week before last, Senator O'Neill had nearly a week in my electorate—fair enough. I've acknowledged the money under the Growing Regions Program, and, if she had asked me, I would have stood alongside her as those announcements were made. In the country, we are civil. We do know the right thing to do. When Senator O'Neill came to open the museum, funding under the Building Better Regions Fund, and cut the ribbon despite the fact she had no idea about the project, I was gracious and welcomed her. That's what country people do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in the electorate, she had the temerity last week to say that the rorts and the slush funds had come to an end. So the rorts and the slush funds had come to an end; she turned up in my electorate to announce this. What I've decided to do is ask the government and Senator O'Neill: which one of these projects is a rort, which one came from a slush fund and which one is not appropriate? Is it the $265 million for safety upgrades on the Newell Highway, the $176 million for a new bridge in Dubbo or the $39.4 billion for the Clontarf Foundation, one of the biggest game changers for young Aboriginal boys at school? I think 10 or 11 academies in my electorate have seen these lads stay at school and go on to employment and further education. Is that a rort? Did that come from a slush fund? There was $35.2 million for the Moree Intermodal Overpass. Well, they've withdrawn that—it's gone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was the Hargraves Lane and Federation Street bypass in Gilgandra, the Newell Highway and Oxley Highway intersection upgrades and the $25 million for the cancer centre. Don't they think the people of western New South Wales are entitled to have cancer treatment? Is that the rort? The Indigenous people and the people that live in western New South Wales who were dying because they couldn't get to Sydney were then getting world-class cancer treatment in their area, in Dubbo. There's a PET scanner. Professionals have come from all over Australia to staff that. Is that a rort, Senator O'Neill? I'd like to know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are more projects: Tooraweenah Road, another highway, the Wilcannia weir, which has now gone from a two-metre weir to a one-metre weir. There was $12.5 million for Pooncarie Road, because when the Menindee Lakes went dry because of drought, I went to the tourist association, and I said: 'We can't make it rain. What do you need?' They said, 'We need better access from the south for the tourists to come with their caravans because our economy relies on that.' So we funded the upgrade to Pooncarie Road. Was that a rort? A terrible thing to do—unbelievable! What about the $10 million for the Burke small stock abattoir that went to the council so they could put in the infrastructure for the abattoir that is now employing 150 people in Burke? Is that the rort? We gave $9½ million to the Australian Opal Centre—a centre that will highlight the unique beauty and the rarity of the Australian black opal from Lightning Ridge. That $9½ million in Commonwealth money came from the previous government, but apparently that's no good either. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on and on and on. There was $8.7 million for the Broken Hill CBD revitalisation and $8.2 million for the County Boundary Road at Croppa Creek. It doesn't sound much, does it? But what if you lived on that road and you had to get your produce to market and you couldn't do it after rain or you couldn't get fertiliser in because the road was wet and unsafe? What about the $7.6 million for the new rural medical school and for those young people who are actually doing their medical degrees in Dubbo and who are now in their second year? There are 520 applicants for those positions. They are some of the brightest young minds in regional Australia. Apparently that's not a good thing either. I've got another page of such projects here—so much frustration in this place. We've seen from the Greens that we live in some sort of a parallel universe where we talk about how we want to improve the lives of Aboriginal people, improve the environment, and do this or that, but they have not one single clue how, practically, to do that. Then all the funding that gives some quality of life to the people who provide the wealth of this country gets ripped out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is probably the last chance I will have to make a speech on an appropriation bill, and I find it incredibly frustrating. It shouldn't be like this. Good luck to the member for Bennelong with all the electric bus interchanges and medical centres and things that he's got in the inner suburbs of Sydney, but the people of regional Australia deserve better than this. They do not need to be ignored, and this budget, apart from what we've seen with the divisive Voice, has done very, very little for the people of western New South Wales.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="278522" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  I've got fantastic news for the member for Parkes: every taxpayer in his electorate will be getting a tax cut, thanks to the budget. I'm sure he will be glad to report back to every taxpayer in Parkes that he'll be supporting it and proudly voting for this budget—unlike what the previous government tried to do, which was to bring in tax cuts only for some people. Those on lower and middle incomes will be getting a much bigger tax cut thanks to this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget was absolutely responsible while it also met the times right now that many Australians are facing. We know that many Australians are facing difficult times right now. We know that many Australians are facing real pressures in their household budgets. We know that, for many Australians, mortgages have been a real stress. Rents have been going up significantly in my own electorate of Macnamara. Over half the electorate are renters, including myself. It is a real stress, if you've got a year-long lease, when the time comes and you have to renegotiate the terms of the lease. Sometimes rent has gone up by 20, 30 or 40 per cent in areas like St Kilda, Southbank and Port Melbourne. It's been extremely stressful, especially for those people who are low- and middle-income earners. This budget recognises that it's time to give Australians a bit more support in their cost-of-living-pressures not only for paying for their home but also for paying for the groceries and the bare minimum. That's exactly what this budget does, and there's a tax cut for every single taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All 95,000 workers in Macnamara will be getting a tax cut. On average, that tax cut in Macnamara will be $1,954. All 95,000 taxpayers in my electorate will be getting a tax cut. If you are a student at Monash and just got your first part-time job, you'll probably be getting a tax cut of around $500. If you're a nurse at the Alfred, one of the great hospitals in Melbourne, and you're on $75,000, you'll get a tax cut of $1,579. If you're working at one of our incredible local arts institutions—one of the fantastic world-class institutions in Macnamara that we are so proud to boast of—you'll get a tax cut. If you are at one of those incredible tech companies or at an engineering or manufacturing company at Port Melbourne, you'll be getting a tax cut as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to complement the tax cuts, we'll also be giving a $300 energy rebate to every single Australian household. You won't have to do anything. That money will go directly onto your power bill, and it will be a reduction of $300. It will also go towards the one million small businesses. They will get just over $300 for their energy bills as well. This rebate goes on top of the rebate we did last year, which was in legislation that we actually recalled the parliament for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you remember, those opposite like to talk about the cost-of-living pressures that Australians face. But despite being given the opportunity to put a cap on coal and gas prices, those opposite decided to vote against it. They decided to vote against a cap on gas and coal prices and to vote against a $1.5 billion nationwide reduction in rising power bills which have filtered down towards businesses and households. The price of power, especially gas on the international market, has gone up dramatically, and it's mainly due to the fact that Russia has invaded Ukraine. It's had a huge flow-on effect on the spot price and a whole range of other different factors, leading to a complicated energy market. So the price of energy has gone up, but these pressures will bring it down. The default market offer only last month reflected that that is now starting to turn, and, with renewable energy coming into the grid, the price of energy is coming down. These energy rebates will add to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other really important reforms of this budget is around HECS. HECS is such an important program. I had a HECS debt, but, like the hundreds of thousands of people around the country who have been able to access university since HECS was brought in, I paid a relatively low-interest loan—as HECS was designed to be. When HECS was introduced, it was designed to be an access point so that anyone who wanted to go to university could go to university. They wouldn't be charged while they were at university; they would be charged only at the point when they were earning enough money to be able to pay back a low-interest loan. We know that the design of HECS was in a low-inflationary environment where wages were traditionally above the inflation rate, and what we have done in this budget is reform it so that HECS is always going to be lower than the real wage increases of Australian workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What that means for Australians, in simple terms, is that there is now $3 billion of student debt that is going to be completely wiped out. Obviously, we have to pay for that, so there's $3 billion budgeted in this budget that will come off student debt. If you've been paying a higher rate of HECS interest, it will be reduced, and you will be getting a return or a credit in order to have a reduction in your HECS debt. This will mean hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands of dollars for most HECS-paying workers, and it is a fantastic reform. I believe in making sure that universities are accessible. The HECS system has been a program in Australia which has allowed governments to support people going to university from right across the country and provide an opportunity for people who otherwise wouldn't have been able to go or afford to go to university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we don't want in Australia is a United States style system, where only those who can afford to go to college go to college. What we want in Australia is to maintain that incredibly important Australian principle of opportunity. We know that education is most powerful form of helping people up the ladder of opportunity and giving people social mobility, my family included. My grandparents left school when they were 13 or 14 when coming to this country, but both of my parents were able to study in a higher education institution and both of my parents were able to go on to jobs that provided a life for me, my brother and my sister that my grandparents would have only dreamed of. My brother, my sister and I were all very fortunate to be able go to university, to have a HECS arrangement and to work towards paying it off. That is something that I completely support, and that change will, in this budget, affect roughly 27,000 people in Macnamara. So that, along with the tax cuts, along with the energy rebates and the HECS debt, will be very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to mention another key aspect of this budget—that is, housing. This budget is quite historic in the way the federal government is re-engaging in the housing system right now. For 10 years the federal government had the approach that it would not be at the table funding social and affordable homes. Previous governments had an ideological bent against investing in social housing. They said it was a matter for the states. Well, it's not. It's not a matter for the states. The federal government has to be at the table working alongside the states and territories in order to fund social housing, because if there are not enough social homes the price of housing will go up everywhere. We need to ensure that right across the housing spectrum there are enough social-housing homes, enough rental properties and enough homes for those people trying to buy their own homes, because if there are not then more and more people will be squeezed down the housing spectrum. That's why we have made these record investments into housing, and it is why we will be investing in homes right across the country, making sure there are new pockets of development, working with states and territories, making sure there are reforms to try and meet the target of building 1.2 million homes over the next five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also means we will be investing in trades and careers in the construction sector, because building homes creates jobs. It creates jobs, good jobs, and we want to make sure that we are not only supporting the training and the professional support and development of tradies, but we will also be investing in 20,000 fee-free TAFE spots for those people who want to help build homes for Australians. We are providing incentives to state and territory governments to get homes built more quickly. I know those opposite like to say housing is a responsibility of the states and territories, and I know the Greens, including in my own electorate, like to oppose the development of housing at every opportunity. They are very happy to say they want more social housing but are not happy to actually get on and help build it. But we are committed to delivering homes for Australians. It can't be fixed overnight. This is a very difficult problem, but we're going to be investing billions of dollars in building more homes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last part of this speech, I want to make some comments about the investments and the dollars in this budget that are going towards the future of this country, especially around the investments in transitioning our economy from a high-emissions economy towards a low-emissions economy. One of the things that was a real frustration of the previous government's budgets was they would constantly try and use the levers and the financial instruments of government to take away money from investing in and subsidising the energy transition from coal and other forms of fossil fuels and use that to prolong the fossil fuel industry. But this budget does not do that. This budget does not invest in new coal. This budget does not invest in new gas. This budget does not invest in CCS. This budget is a direct investment in the new and low-emission technology we need going forward. I'm incredibly proud of it for a number of reasons. First, it creates jobs. It creates jobs in the region and right around the country, because climate change is an economic opportunity. Deputy Speaker Vasta, you know this and I know this. Those opposite like to put their heads in the sand and pretend it's not, but it is. Instead of coming into this place and trying to do things like making the Australian Renewable Energy Agency invest in gas, in other forms of CSS—as the shadow Treasurer did when he was the energy minister—we have used every fund and budgetary measure that we can to invest in the transition towards a low-emissions future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't need to take my word for it. I'm going to quote the Climate Council, who said this about the budget:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Billions for green industry, no new money for gas—this is how we build Australia's clean future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I'm proud of that. I'm proud of the fact that, as part of the investments that we are making, we have allocated $22.7 billion to fund the transition towards net zero. There is our new money, including $28 million over two years towards a national adaptation plan, $1.3 billion over the next decade for the Hydrogen Headstart program, $121 million for Australia's first national independent environment protection agency, which the minister for the environment introduced into the parliament today and which is going to have strong new powers and penalties to better protect nature. This is a good budget and a responsible budget, when we look at how we are setting up our future and how we are setting up our economy as we transition towards a low-emissions future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a couple of other measures in this budget that I'm really proud of. The electorate of Macnamara is home to some of the best artistic institutions in the entire world, let alone the country. And we don't get that world-class creative sector that we've got in my electorate without training the young Australians and training the young artists in the fields of their talents, passions and expertise. That's why I'm incredibly proud of the $117 million in this budget that is going to eight national arts training organisations, including the Australian Ballet School, which I was pleased to visit with the Minister for the Arts last week, and the Australian National Academy of Music, whose home is in South Melbourne, in my electorate; it's currently got a residency in Abbotsford, in the electorate of the member for Melbourne. I'm looking forward to ANAM taking its rightful place back at home in Macnamara. We are investing in the future of these organisations and the future careers of these young artists, and I'm incredibly proud of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is a responsible budget. It's one that delivers a surplus for the second time in two years—something those opposite put on a mug but didn't actually deliver in the budget papers. This budget is a reflection of responsible economic management, while also understanding that Australians are facing cost-of-living pressures and while also investing in the things we need for the future—investing in more homes, investing in the future of education, making sure that more Australians can access university but not be burdened by debt. This budget also invests in the clean energy future that we desperately need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot have our heads in the sand. We need to do everything we possibly can to reduce our emissions. But we have to do it by creating jobs, bringing the country with us and investing in the sort of technology that is going to make Australia prosperous for the years to come. I'm proud of this budget. I'm proud of the impacts that this is going to have and the assistance it's going to give to the people in my wonderful electorate. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  I rise to speak on these appropriation bills which deliver this government's third budget. As the Independent member for Indi, I seek out my constituents' views on the issues that come before the federal parliament: the high cost of living, health and aged care, climate change and energy, housing, and much more. I approached this budget—and in fact every budget—no differently. I reach out widely across my electorate to understand where Indi is thriving and where we need a boost from the federal government to fully reach our potential. This includes the nine local government areas of Indi—health providers, including Albury-Wodonga Health; education providers, like GOTAFE and Wodonga TAFE; the peak tourism bodies, which are huge drivers of Indi's economy, like Tourism North East and the alpine resorts; and many, many more. These vital organisations have underscored for me the challenges that we collectively face: the impacts of severe weather events like the flooding in 2022 and the impacts of the pandemic-driven regional population boom. They've not gone away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The hardworking Indi electorate offices are the key point of contact for everyday Indi constituents. My staff in these offices hear about people's experiences and struggles and provide support to constituents in areas from health care, NDIS and social services to immigration, housing and many more things. I want to thank everyone of those groups and individuals that wrote to me, met with me, called and emailed my office about what they wanted to see in this budget. I'm proud to represent these voices. I'm proud to represent them in my annual budget submission, which I presented to the Treasurer before the budget. I now want to address that budget itself and whether it met the needs and the expectations of the people I represent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Macnamara just listed many arts organisations that have benefited from this budget, but he forgot one really important one, the only regional arts organisation that was included in that funding. I'm really pleased the budget included $7.3 million for the Flying Fruit Fly Circus, Australia's national youth circus located on the border of my electorate in Albury-Wodonga. This money will help fund additional staff, including circus program teachers. I called for this support for the fruit flies in my budget submission. It's a really significant investment in our region's talented young people, and the border community should feel very proud about this recognition. Congratulations to the CEO, Richard Hull, and all of the fruities, staff and students, for this absolutely fantastic boost—in fact, the best boost they've had in funding in their 48-year history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As in much of Australia, cost-of-living pressures are being felt strongly across Indi. I'm acutely aware that households are struggling to stay on top of daily expenses like energy bills, like rent or mortgage payments, like groceries and like trips to the doctor. These are all essential items. In my budget submission, I called for practical measures the government can take to lighten the load on households without increasing inflation. I'm pleased the government announced in the budget that it will extend and expand Energy Bill Relief Fund to provide a $300 rebate to all households and $325 to eligible small businesses. Reducing power bills will be a welcome relief to Indi households and businesses. This will help them, but really it is just a start. The government needs to follow the lead of the states and make it easier for households to access new rooftop solar home batteries and energy efficiency upgrades, because that's the kind of investment that will permanently lower energy bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also deeply disappointed that the government did not expand the energy efficiency grants for small and medium-sized enterprises. Making it easier for households and businesses to electrify is one of the best ways to reduce energy bills now and, again, one of the best ways for long-term savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have failed to improve cost of living for the most vulnerable by failing again to increase JobSeeker in this budget. Since 2019 I have pushed the government of the day to raise the rate. The experts are backing me in this call. It's a recommendation of the government's own Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee. Make no mistake—the government have the means to raise JobSeeker. They did it in 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, when JobSeeker was increased by $550 a fortnight. The positive impact of that was profound. The Productivity Commission said that, as a result, Australia experienced an unprecedented fall in income inequality. That this budget fails to increase JobSeeker, or any other related working-age payments, is truly a very big missed opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To address the cost-of-living crisis requires action on the housing crisis. According to CoreLogic just this week, house prices in regional Australia are the highest they've ever been and are growing faster than in the capital cities. Government action is desperately needed. For the 50 per cent of renters in Indi experiencing housing stress, the announcement to increase all Commonwealth rent assistance maximum rates by 10 per cent from September this year will help. An additional $1 billion in grants for transitional housing for women and children experiencing domestic violence and for youth is so important, but it must reach women and children in regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The additional $1 billion for critical enabling infrastructure provided in the budget is exactly what I've been calling on this government to deliver. Local governments in my electorate and right across regional Australia desperately need more funding to connect the utilities, including sewerage and water infrastructure, required to unlock new housing supply. This funding is a step in the right direction, but it isn't enough, and I'll tell you why. My proposal for a regional housing infrastructure fund shows that the regions alone require up to $2 billion for the crucial infrastructure that will help to address the housing crisis, but the government has only invested $1.5 billion to meet the needs of the whole nation, and, despite 30 per cent of Australians living in regional communities, there is absolutely no guarantee from this government that a fair share of this funding will flow to them. The government fails to answer why there is no dedicated amount of funding to build homes in regional and rural Australia. Regional councils and the communities that they represent should not be forced to compete with major cities for housing funding. It simply isn't fair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After assistance with social security payments and housing, one of the topics constituents call my office about most frequently is access to health services in Indi. Health services in my electorate desperately need government support, leadership and action. My electorate is serviced by the only cross-border health service in Australia, and we have been waiting years to see the funding for a fit-for-purpose single-site hospital. We know that, in a publicly released letter, the state governments in Victoria and New South Wales have been told their funding commitment to redeveloping Albury Base Hospital will not even come close to meeting the needs of this rapidly growing community, and the implications of this are truly dire. People across the Albury-Wodonga region will continue to face longer wait times. Doctors, nurses and allied health professionals will be spread across two sites, and our system will remain under stress and strain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was glad to see in the budget an increase in federal funding towards public hospitals from 2025 under the National Health Reform Agreement, with the Commonwealth government's contribution increasing from 40 to 45 per cent. This increase means there is now no excuse—no excuse at all—for the New South Wales and Victorian governments to withhold funding for a single-site Albury-Wodonga hospital. Indeed, I call on the Prime Minister and the health minister here to hold them to account on this. An increase in funding means they need to finally give due attention to Albury Wodonga Health and a single-site hospital on the border, because in the regions we deserve a hospital that puts people at the centre of service delivery and is capable of training and retaining a world-class healthcare workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional towns must be set up to attract and hold onto the skilled professionals required to meet our healthcare needs, our aged-care needs and our childcare needs. But to achieve this requires meaningful investment in regional development. The Regional Ministerial Budget Statement acknowledges this, stating that health and aged care are fundamental to making regions increasingly better places to live, work and invest. Well, yes, of course I agree with this. However, in addressing measures to improve regional outcomes, the budget statement simply repurposes budget announcements that apply to all Australians no matter where they live, like funding for an additional Medicare urgent-care clinic. Tacking the phrase 'including in regional Australia' on the end of funding announcements does not equate to good policymaking for regional Australia. It simply doesn't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget leans heavily on the Future Made in Australia as an investment opportunity for regional, rural and remote Australia—billions of dollars to produce renewable hydrogen, refine and processed critical minerals, manufacture solar panels and more. I welcome new investment in renewable energy, a necessity to get us on the pathway to achieving net zero by 2050. What I didn't see, though, was how regional communities will have a say in and benefit from these projects and the energy transformation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Climate Change and Energy knows all too well how I feel about this. It's why last year I worked with him to get up an independent community engagement review into renewable energy infrastructure, led by former Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner Professor Andrew Dyer. This review confirmed what I have heard right across Indi: that regional Australians feel like the renewable transition is happening to them; it's not happening with them. Over 90 per cent of the review's survey respondents were dissatisfied with the extent to which project developers engaged with the local community. This is serious.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've called on the government to implement Professor Dyer's recommendations in the federal budget, and I'm pleased to see a start on this. The budget provides $20.7 million to improve engagement with communities impacted by renewable energy projects; movement on national developer standards; and a package to realise community benefits—all recommendations of the Dyer review. With no information, though, about how this $20.7 million will be delivered, the devil will be in the detail, and I want to see these measures deliver long-term prosperity for regional communities. The government must offer meaningful, tangible, touchable community benefit, if it wants to make its Future Made in Australia plan one that will truly succeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like me, local governments in Indi are relieved to see in the budget increased funding under the Roads to Recovery Program, which will rise from $500 million to $1 billion per year. Regional and rural roads are eroding before our eyes after flooding. Councils are struggling to find the funds to repair them, let alone to build them back better to withstand future severe weather events. As a member of the Standing Committee on Regional Development, Infrastructure and Transport inquiring into roads last year, I heard about expanding Roads to Recovery as the type of funding our roads need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in many ways, this budget is a missed opportunity for investment in regional, rural and remote Australia. The government's flagship regional grant programs, the Regional Precincts and Partnerships Program and the Growing Regions Program, are not allocated additional funding rounds, despite the growing need and increasing price tag on development projects. In fact, the first round of successful and unsuccessful applicants has only just been announced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I'm pleased that two projects in my electorate—one in Mansfield, the Lords Reserve pavilion; and one in Benalla, the art gallery—received much-needed funding. The Benalla and Mansfield communities will see benefits from these projects for years to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the recent announcements left many, many people disappointed. Despite communities around Australia asking for more than $2.7 billion in projects, the government has funded just $207 million—only seven per cent of what regional Australia needs. It shows that these programs are underfunded and oversubscribed, despite the obvious need in regional communities. The ask is massive because the need is massive, and there's nowhere else to go. It's why, in my Indi budget submission, I made the case for increased and ongoing investment in these grant programs that specifically fund regional and rural projects. Regional and rural councils continuously make the case to me about how hard it is to compete with their metro and suburban counterparts for the same pools of grant funding because they don't often have the resources and the ratepayer base to match Commonwealth funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget has some welcome measures, and I understand the government's challenges in not wanting to fuel inflation. It's vital that we bring inflation down, to ease cost-of-living pressure. However, where the government has announced funding in their housing and their Future Made in Australia policies in particular, the regions remain a blind spot. I'm worried about it, and I want the government to step up to the challenge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional Australia powers the nation. We feed and clothe the nation. I want to see the government put focus on the regions so that we're not constantly competing with the cities for our fair share of funding, and I will keep advocating for measures that ensure a prosperous and thriving future for all regional and rural communities.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  From 1 July, the Albanese Labor government will be delivering a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer. That means every one of Newcastle's 78,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut. On average, Newcastle taxpayers will have, come 1 July, an extra $1,642 in their pocket. That's because the Albanese Labor government wants Australians to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. Our bigger tax cuts for more taxpayers will help make that happen. Nurses, teachers and truckies are some of those who will most likely benefit, among the more than 95 per cent of taxpayers now getting a bigger tax cut. And, from 1 July, all Newcastle households will have a $300 credit automatically applied to their electricity bills. That's a $75 credit each quarter. Then there are around one million small businesses who will receive $325 off their electricity bills over the 2024-25 year. This builds on the cost-of-living measures we've already put in place, like cheaper child care for families, tripling the incentive for GPs to bulk-bill and creating local jobs and getting wages moving again. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To support renters in Newcastle who are doing it tough, we're delivering the first back-to-back increase to the Commonwealth rent assistance in more than 30 years. We're increasing the maximum rates of Commonwealth rent assistance by 10 per cent, benefiting some 7,810 households in Newcastle. This builds on the government's 15 per cent increase in September last year. Combined with indexation, since the Albanese Labor government was elected, rent assistance has now increased by more than 40 per cent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're making student loans simpler and fairer, reducing the debt of more than 25,000 Novocastrians and backdating these savings to 1 June 2023. That date is important. We're making sure that student debt never grows faster than someone's wages or their ability to pay it off. Last year's indexation spike was unfair. Under our changes, that won't happen again. We've fixed the problem, and we've also backdated the fix to 1 June 2023 to take account of that big inflation spike that really hit students last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time ever in Australia's history, we're introducing a new Commonwealth prac payment to support teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students who are undertaking mandatory work placements as part of their degree. This payment will provide around 68,000 eligible university students and over 5,000 VET students each year with a payment of just under $320 per week during their clinical and professional placements. This will be in addition, of course, to any income support they might already receive and will help up to 5,200 students who are enrolled in teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work at the University of Newcastle.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is committed to delivering cheaper medicines. We know that six out of 10 PBS scripts go to pensioners and concession card holders, so we're freezing the cost of their medicines for five years. That means that no pensioner or concession card holder will pay more than $7.70 for their PBS medications for the next five years. Everyone else with a Medicare card will pay no more than $31.60 per script for PBS medicines both this year and next year.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a budget that takes important steps to build women's health into the very foundations of our stronger Medicare. As part of our dedicated women's health package, we're cutting the cost of a revolutionary new breast cancer treatment from $100,000 to just $31.60. We're establishing new Medicare items so that we make sure that women have got that affordable access to the longer specialist consults for endometriosis and complex gynaecological conditions like chronic pelvic pain and polycystic ovary syndrome. We're establishing new Medicare services for mothers to see midwives before and after birth. We're improving education on miscarriage support services and collecting data on miscarriages to improve care and support. More health practitioners will be undertaking training to deliver long-acting reversible contraceptive devices such as IUDs. We're improving the treatment of women going through menopause by training our health professionals. We're tackling period poverty by providing free pads and tampons to women in rural and remote First Nations communities, and there will be more access to professional indemnity insurance for midwives, which will improve birthing-on-country services for First Nations mothers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also putting mental health at the heart of a stronger Medicare. Almost half of all Australians will experience a mental health concern in their lifetime, and everyone's experience is different. Our $361 million package means Australians will get the right level of care for their level of need. Measures that shift away from the one-size-fits-all approach and relieve pressure on the Better Access initiative include: a new national early intervention service that anyone can access for free whenever they need to; an upgraded nationwide network of 61 Medicare mental health centres to offer free walk-in access for adults with more complex mental health needs; funding for primary health networks to work in partnership with general practices to commission mental health workers to offer wraparound care for people with high needs, in between their medical appointments; and a new national peer workforce association to help unlock the potential of the workforce. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're making big investments to support women's safety. Rates of intimate partner violence remain at epidemic proportions in Australia, with a quarter of women experiencing this in their lifetime. We know that violence isn't inevitable, and the high rates of gender based violence demand our full attention as we work to tackle the deeply ingrained social, cultural, political and economic factors that lead to violent behaviour. The National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children continues to guide the efforts of all Australian governments to end gender based violence within one generation. Funding in this budget brings the Labor government's total investment to support women's safety and the national plan to over $3.4 billion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that people's eyes gloss over when they hear these big figures. So what do they actually mean? They mean we're improving and making permanent the Leaving Violence Program. Too often financial insecurity can be a barrier to escaping violence, and this investment will help people experiencing intimate partner violence to leave those relationships. It will provide those who are eligible with access to up to $5,000 in financial support as well as important referral services so that they have access to safety risk assessments and proper safety planning. These are services that women are not currently accessing. We need to make sure that when women make the very difficult and brave decision to leave a violent relationship—because we know that's when they are most at risk—they have access to the financial means to get themselves and their children to safety and that they undergo risk assessments and safety planning. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're strengthening the social safety net through the back-to-back boost to Commonwealth rent assistance and by expanding eligibility for parenting payment single. Single women, including single parents, make up around 51 per cent of those claiming Commonwealth rent assistance, and they are now going to be eligible for this additional rent assistance. The maximum payment they will be able to receive will have a really positive impact on vulnerable cohorts such as women and kids leaving violent relationships. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also includes a new decision to direct $1 billion of funding from the National Housing Infrastructure Facility towards crisis and transitional accommodation for women and children fleeing violence, and for youth. We know we must do more to prevent violence from occurring, and indeed escalating, including targeting high-risk perpetrators and the risk of homicide. To address this, this budget provides funding for a rapid review of targeted prevention approaches to violence against women, with a panel of experts to provide advice to government on preventing gender based violence, including a focus on homicides. We're putting more funding into Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety, ANROWS, to further build the evidence base on pathways into and out of perpetration of family, domestic and sexual violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're establishing the National Student Ombudsman to help eradicate gender based violence from our universities, and we're establishing the National Higher Education Code to Prevent and Respond to Gender-based Violence. This budget also delivers investments to support the National Criminal Intelligence System, which provides Australian law enforcement and our intelligence agencies with secure access to a national view of criminal intelligence and information, including on domestic violence perpetrators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst this announcement didn't make the headlines, one thing we wanted to see in this budget—and that I, especially, wanted to see in this budget—was an expansion of the primary health networks' domestic and family violence primary health outreach program, which has just been trialled on the Central Coast. I am thrilled that an investment of $6 million over two years has been included in the budget. This will allow the program to expand both within the Hunter New England Central Coast PHN and across five other PHNs. This fantastic program provides trauma informed health care to women and their children residing in refuge accommodation. This care includes a GP, a mental health nurse and a paediatric speech pathologist working in partnership with the domestic and family violence sector. Its expansion means that women and children in temporary accommodation and refuges across our region will have access to trauma informed primary health care for the first time in a very long time—possibly the first time ever. The PHN team rightly argued that children and their mothers in refuge accommodation were some of the least likely to access health and early intervention services. Without attendance at early intervention nursing checks, unique developmental needs were not being identified until school age, resulting in children missing out on the important window for early childhood intervention prior to formal schooling. I look forward to seeing the continued success of this as it evolves across our region.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there is a massive housing shortage in Australia. Whether you're renting, buying or building, more homes are necessary for more security for everyone, especially those people I represent in Newcastle. That's why we've got a very ambitious goal to build 1.2 million homes by the end of the decade. I know that there are some people who scoff at this bill, but I say that, if you do not dare to be ambitious about addressing this housing crisis, then you are wasting your time in this chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If ever there was a region well positioned to do the transition to the net zero economy, it's Newcastle—I spoke earlier tonight on another piece of legislation on that—but this budget before us tonight is a budget for all Australians. It's not just for some; it's not just for the precious few. We know that there is much more to do in all of these areas I've outlined this evening. Our commitment is that we will work every day to deliver for every Australian.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249308" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:08</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2024-2025 and related bills. Whilst I won't oppose these bills, which ensure that the government's programs are funded, I must express my deep disappointment with this year's budget. The central promise made by the Prime Minister at the last election was that if you voted for him and the Labor Party, you would be better off. Life would be cheaper; life would be better. However, as we all know, the opposite has occurred, and the cost of living has gone through the roof, impacting every Australian household. Housing is up 12 per cent. Rents are up 12 per cent as well. Insurance is up 26 per cent. In many parts of my electorate it's up significantly more than that 26 per cent. Electricity is up 18 per cent, and gas is up 25 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the dozen interest rate rises that have occurred under this Labor government have amounted to severe mortgage stress for so many Australian families. Despite Labor promising cheaper mortgages, the typical Australian household with a mortgage is more than $35,000 worse off. The budget provided the government with the perfect opportunity to outline a plan to get homegrown inflation under control, which will in time enable the Reserve Bank to reduce interest rates. Unfortunately, the government are now doubling down on their big-spending agenda and failing energy and migration policies. It's not just the Liberal Party that is raising significant concerns with this year's budget. Steve Hamilton, a renowned economist, described it as 'reckless' and 'the most irresponsible budget in recent memory'. This budget means higher inflation for longer. A worrying sign today is the increase in CPI to 6.4 per cent, up from 5.4 per cent last month.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently caught up with a team at Foodbank in Geraldton. Incredibly, Foodbank are now servicing dual-income families who can no longer afford their groceries. How shameful for a country as rich as Australia that we now have the working poor. Sadly, more and more dual-income families are walking through the doors of Foodbank looking for help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this $315 billion of extra spending, the regions are still being left behind. Given the limited amount of time I have to speak in this debate tonight, I will swiftly remind the House that there has been a two-year funding drought for regional infrastructure after Labor abolished the Building Better Regions Fund and cancelled grants to the successful applicants under round 6. In October 2022 Labor announced the Building Better Regions Fund would be substituted for the Growing Regions Program, which sounded pretty good at the time. As to what could be expected with this funding drought, many applications were made under the new program. In fact, there were 440 applications initially assessed as worthy by the regional development department and a parliamentary panel which was handpicked by the minister for infrastructure. Incredibly, 90 per cent of regional projects were rejected despite the government confirming the program underspent $93.4 million or 31 per cent of the provided funding. So not only did Labor bin nine out of 10 applications, but only two-thirds of the funding promised for the Growing Regions Program's first round was actually spent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the Shire of Wyndham East Kimberley for their successful application for funding towards an extension of the runway at the East Kimberley Regional Airport, a very worthy project. I note the previous government had also provided them with important infrastructure funding also for their airport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to congratulate the Midwest Community Living Association, who will receive funding towards the creation of an inclusive multipurpose opportunity hub in Geraldton which will support independent living and training for people with disabilities. I am particularly pleased for this organisation, who provide such a critical service to those in need in the Midwest, so well done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, there were many, many other worthy organisations and local communities that had their projects rejected. These included projects like the construction of the Newman youth and community hub, the Broome regional resource recovery park, the Lower Chittering community centre and the new marine rescue facility in Port Hedland. This is just to name a few of the very worthy unsuccessful applicants from my electorate. Many of these projects could have been funded if the program had been delivered as promised—or perhaps from other areas of government waste and spending, like the $40 million the government has spent to advertise the revised tax cuts or the wasteful $450 million spent on the failed Voice referendum. As we see, once again, it's not about money; it's about priorities, and clearly regional Australia is not a priority for the Albanese Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that those opposite understand the disappointment and anger of the applicants that have missed out, especially the ones that, after the expression of interest process, were then encouraged to spend more time and energy to complete a full application. Not only did the government choose to gut the program but they failed to deliver the funding announcements on time. Amazingly, the guidelines for the program stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If you are successful, you must commence your project no later than 15 May 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, it's a little bit hard when the successful applicants were actually announced on 16 May. So they told you, 'You've got to have started spending the money and started the project by 15 May,' but they didn't tell anybody who was going to be successful until 16 May. Honestly, what sort of show is this mob running? The government's failures through the Growing Regions Program are simply indicative of a broader trend of neglect for regional infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also foreshadowed in the budget is the abolition of the Mobile Black Spot Program from 2026-27. People won't be surprised that this is a very successful program of the coalition. It funded somewhere in the vicinity of 1,500 new mobile phone towers in areas where the telcos tell us that it's not commercially viable for them to build the towers themselves. People will understand that in an electorate like Durack, the largest in our country, we were a major beneficiary, and I don't think anybody would hold that against the people of Durack, because there is such great need. But there is still great need, so I can tell you my constituents will be very disappointed to hear that in a few years that program will be gone. Not only will this have a drastic impact in case of emergencies, whether they're to do with health or with natural disaster, but there is also no escaping that mobile connectivity is so important to participating in the modern world, whether you live in Marble Bar, in Chittering or in Geraldton.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mobile Black Spot Program joins a long list of regional programs that have been abolished by the Albanese Labor government. These include, as I've said before, the Building Better Regions Fund and the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, which was so important during COVID and which kept local councils and local tradies afloat and enabled our local councils, of which I represent some 41, to get small low-hanging fruit projects done. For the last two years, all I've heard about is how important that Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program was, and it's a real shame that this government hasn't continued with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were also community development grants and, of course, the wonderful Stronger Communities Program, which my friend here, the member for Hinkler, will know was such an important program because—and I know the Deputy Speaker will agree with me—it was a program that the local member could control together with a community committee. It made such a difference to identifying those important projects throughout the whole of the electorate, and it's a real shame. It's a shame on the Labor government for not continuing with that program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I did have some hope that in the budget we would see a return of the Stronger Communities Program, which, as I've said, has helped so many grassroots organisations in my electorate. I thought this was a very strong possibility because I have seen so many of my colleagues on the other side, time after time, spruiking how wonderful the Stronger Communities Program is when they would get up and talk about it in a 90-second statement or a three-minute constituency statement. So I had great hope and faith that we might have had a return to the Stronger Communities Program. Alas, that program was not re-funded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, despite the government's obvious failures, they have not provided funding in the budget for any new programs to support regional economic development. It's clear to me that only a change in government will lead to the prioritisation of regional infrastructure, particularly in Western Australia and particularly in regional and remote parts. Likewise, only a change in government will result in a return to sensible economic management. We will get inflation down, restore the Australian dream of homeownership and abandon Labor's reckless renewables-only strategy. The election will provide a clear choice for Australians, and it cannot come soon enough.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  Thank you very much. In September, I would have been here for 11 years. This is a place of highs and lows, challenges and roadblocks. There are a lot of things that get in the way, I've got to say, Mr Deputy Speaker—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The DEPUTY SPEAKER:</span>  But not 7.30!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="148150" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PITT:</span>
                    </a>  Not 7.30! However, when you get something done here, it's usually a serious something. It is something that matters. They could be things that move the country. They could be things that are in the national interest. They can be things which assist your community. In terms of disappointments in the last budget handed down by the Treasurer, I don't think I've ever been more disappointed than to hear that the almost $600 million which we secured as the coalition government for the repairs to Paradise Dam had been cut. The budget paper has a line in it that says they are deferred. I can tell you they're not deferred; they are not there. In the five-year forecast of the budget, the money is not there. That is a cut. By definition, it has been cut from the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To give you an idea of just how important this is, this dam secures our agricultural region. It has been one of the highest-reliability dams in Australia for water supply, and it has been an absolute debacle. Make no mistake this is the biggest public infrastructure failure in this country's history, and it is all at the feet of state Labor governments and now a federal Labor government who will not fund it. The repairs are necessary. Some of the history—it has now been 4½ years since the Queensland state Labor government announced the dam had safety issues and capacity would need to be reduced. So they lowered the level of the dam and then spun that as 'free water'. So you were pouring literally thousands of megalitres down the river for people who may or may not be able to pick it up at the time it flowed past. Apparently, that was free and that was a great outcome. They then passed legislation to override all the other things they'd have to do in order to knock the wall down and reduce capacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, on 22 July 2021, in the ABC Wide Bay studio, my local studio, said of Paradise Dam, 'It should be fixed and it should be fixed as soon as possible.' Well, Prime Minister, you can't fix it without funding. You simply cannot. For the people in my region, this will have a direct impact on the value of their properties and on the reliability of the water supply for what is now a very expansive agricultural area that relies on water for tree crops, macadamias, avocados and horticulture. If you cannot guarantee your water supply, then potentially you lose decades of investment, because tree crops are lost in a drought. If you're growing high-volume, low-value crop, like sugarcane—I don't have wheat locally—the reality is that you can pick up next year and try and recover, but not with tree crops. So this is an absolute disaster, and the people of my electorate know it. They know that it has to be delivered. But the idea that the Commonwealth, this federal Labor government, will not contribute in the next five years—five years on top of the 4½ that we have already had. So nine years, no money, no action, not repaired—that is clearly the only option, because it's not funded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what happens locally? There is a loss of confidence. Potentially, you have a loss in value. You definitely have a loss in people forecasting, planting and investing. There is no doubt about that whatsoever. I'd say to the state Labor government and to my own side, the state LNP: you need to fast-track this proposal. The concept that an existing dam, which has now been reduced in capacity, which is allegedly going to be repaired and reinstated to the same capacity, has to go through every single approval again, to put it back to the same level of water, in the same place, at the same dam, with the same offtake—you do not need to do the environmental assessments again. You do not. There is no change in the impact; it is the same. It is the same level. So there are opportunities here for state governments to put legislation in place which will fast-track this dam and get it secured for the people I represent, and that is absolutely critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at a function over the weekend. The Bundaberg Fruit and Vegetables Growers do a biannual event. It's huge. The waiting list has hundreds of people. Unfortunately, none of the state Labor members, including the local member—the member for Bundaberg—could get there. The state minister sent a video. Can I say that it went down like a brick-and-tile glider. Minister Furner presented a video to the group, and I heard one person clap out of the hundreds that were there. They know the impact of this decision. This is the future of our region. It is about water security, which they had; they had made investment decisions on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can you imagine if you borrowed money for your home only to find later down the track that, actually, there had been an error and you would have to reduce it by three bedrooms back to five bedrooms, assuming you had a substantial palace, off the basis of a failure by the then government to build a dam which they actually built to a price and not a standard and which has now failed? It is outrageous. There should be more noise about this. Sunwater, the local operator, has said that it is now going to cost—on top of the existing construction costs and the couple of hundred million dollars to already knock it down and do repairs—more than the $1.2 billion we had allocated to repair it. This is an incredible failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate that state governments—and I don't care where they come from—have an opportunity to fast-track this dam. It will make no difference to the environment. It is the same footprint at the same level. They could give confidence to my community and commit the funding that is required, and the Prime Minister could meet the promise he made to the people of my region. He made it publicly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of other things inside the appropriation bill, there are a significant number of projects, and there's some argy-bargy. We heard from Senator Chisholm in the other place about how he, of course, always invites the local member. Well, he might have missed a couple. In fact, he was there for the opening of any number of the projects which were commenced by the coalition and completed in recent months. If we look at the Pacific Marine Base at the Port of Bundaberg, which was significantly delayed over a period of time, Senator Chisholm managed to open that in September 2023, but my invitation must have been lost—what an inconvenience! But that's great; we still got it delivered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a multipurpose conveyor at the Port of Bundaberg, which actually matters. Because the state took so long to approve it, the $10 million we had allocated wasn't enough. I had to secure another $7.7 million. The Port of Bundaberg has, for a long time, basically solely been a sugar port. The local sugar industry is in decline. It is much smaller than it used to be. In fact, in the nineties the local region probably grew six million tonnes of sugar cane. This season I expect probably 2.5 tonnes. That has an obvious impact on what is exported out of a sugar port dedicated to that. One of the ways to ensure that the Port of Bundaberg is maintained and becomes profitable is to ensure that they can actually ship other products, and the purpose of the multiuse conveyor is to do exactly that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer showed up for that—no, sorry, it was Minister Kristy McBain who came along. In fact, the Treasurer was for a different one. He managed to find his way up to our place and to the local region. I'm sure that, if I sent him a map, he'd be able to find it again—it would be all good. The Hervey Bay CBD redevelopment is part of the Hinkler Regional Deal, and Senator Chisholm came and opened that one too. I'm sure he did a good job. It's underway, and it's being delivered for the people I represent. That is the outcome that we need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear from the Albanese government—from Minister King and others—who are constantly in the parliament, who are out in the media and who are out in our regions, and they describe some of our funds and priority projects as rorts. I want to give the House and those listening an idea of what the Labor Party, the Labor government and the Labor ministry consider to be rorts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Building Better Regions Fund in my patch, we contributed to and helped to deliver the Royal Flying Doctor Service and LifeFlight joint base. The Labor government considers that to be a rort. Accommodation on site shortens the travel time, shortens the response time and delivers for the people at a time of desperate need. I've spoken about the Pacific Marine Base, the Burnett Heads town centre and IWC stage 2, but I'll give you an idea of just how essential the Stronger Communities Program was, which included $150,000 per electorate. In the last round that it existed, because it was cut by the Labor government, my office received 100 expressions of interest requesting $1,436,108 for the funding allocation of just $150,000. That is how desperate the need is in my local region, and this program is no longer funded by the Labor Party, by the Labor government, by this Treasurer and by this Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some things that the Labor government considers to be rorts. Outside broadcast equipment for Fraser Coast Community Radio: the Labor Party considers that to be a rort. A new kitchen at C&amp;K Oaks Beach Community Kindergarten: the Labor Party considers that a rort. Air conditioning at the Woodgate Community Hall: the Labor Party considers that a rort. The Hervey Bay Neighbourhood Centre Community Cafe, used to provide training: the Labor Party considers that a rort. A wheelchair-accessible bus for the Endeavour Foundation in Bundaberg: the Labor Party considers that a rort. Little libraries for Childers built by the Men's Shed: the Labor Party considers that a rort. Installation of a Liberty Swing at Hervey Bay Special School: because it's part of this program, this has been described by the Labor Party as a rort. A trailer for the Bundaberg Rowing Club to transport boats to competition: the Labor Party considers it a rort. New scoreboards for the Woodgate Bowls Club: the Labor Party considers that a rort. New change rooms and amenities at the Diggers Football Club: the Labor Party considers that a rort. The kitchen upgrade at the Elouera Girl Guides campsite at Mon Repos: the Labor Party considers that a rort.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is outrageous. They should change their language, because in the regions that is a lot of lamingtons.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We of course will support the appropriations bills, as all oppositions do. But I, for one, think the Labor government needs to reconsider its language on how regional areas are supported, particularly at a time like this where a cost-of-living crisis is in place.</span>

We will get on with it, but, once again, a Labor government needs to change its language and reconsider what it means to live in regional Australia, because they need the help.</span>
