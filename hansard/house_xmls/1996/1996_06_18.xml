        I do not know if the honourable member has actually seen the press release by Shock Records only this week, but I am pleased to say that it indicates that they have just announced that they will reduce the price of the top ten CD titles in Australia down to $25 from an average of $31. Polygram Records have also followed suit. So there is some movement now in terms of prices for the top titles. The government welcomes that move, but as I say we will be monitoring it closely. We will be consulting with the ACCC and also widely with the industry to get to the position where the government needs to be to see lower prices for consumers.

        I have recently agreed in principle to facilitate a proposal arising out of the demutualisation of Colonial Mutual. Colonial Mutual has purchased the State Bank of New South Wales and, as a condition of that, was required to demutualise.

        The takeover of the Bank of New South Wales by Colonial Mutual was done under a longstanding arrangement, a facility which allowed a holding company to take over a bank where the holding company was an Australian non&amp;hyphen;mutual life.

        I make it clear, however, that the government welcomes competition in the financial industry. It believes that there are enormous advantages from new entrants into the financial industry. With variable mortgage rates, we have seen reductions as a result of new entrants and new competition, and the government believes that, by improving the opportunity for new entrants and for more competition, it will be delivering the best results to consumers, both to home buyers and to small businesses, who have red&amp;hyphen;hot, full&amp;hyphen;blooded competition in the financial sector which will ultimately be to their benefit.

        I am digressing, though, because the real issue here is Australia being elected to the United Nations Security Council. I am cautiously optimistic about Australia's chances. We certainly have very strong support from the Pacific island countries and the east Asian region, from the Caribbean and the Gulf Cooperation Council. We still have more work to do with African countries and more work to do in Europe, including central and eastern Europe. But the simple argument that Australia can put—that the other two candidates are both European Union candidates and Australia obviously is not—is, in my view, a very strong argument for us to put.

        The European Union already has two permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, and it also has two of the non-permanent positions—the two for the West Europe and Others Group at the moment. For the United Nations General Assembly to elect two more EU members for the next two years to the non-permanent West Europe and Others Group seats I think would be a major mistake. I do not think the West Europe and Others Group representation on the Security Council should be dominated by the European Union—no objection to the European Union, but I do not think the council should be dominated by the European Union. It is very important, therefore, that Australia win this election, and the government will work hard to ensure that we do so.

         —I thank the honourable member for his question. I must say that, when I read the reports this morning of further amendments from the Labor opposition, I could only come to the conclusion that the confusion continues within their ranks. I was interested because it was only a couple of days ago that the number of amendments we could look forward to was around 200, but this morning it has grown to the precise number of 291. I can only assume that their confusion is so great that they are now amending their amendments before they bring them into the House.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In this latest set apparently they are supporting superunions and amalgamations to achieve them but they are also supporting disamalgamations—so we have them getting bigger, getting smaller. They are supporting the retention of the conveniently belong rule, but at the same time if that does not work they want a complete open slather. They really are all over the place. They seem to have a lot of problems coming to grips with some of the essential issues.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If there is any problem in publishing their amendments, I think we would be prepared to help. The government's bill is on the Internet. We have had 60,000 hits on the Internet in terms of people looking at our bill. I think a lot of people would be interested to know about Labor's amendments. So I challenge the honourable member for Canberra, if he has some amendments, whether the number is 291 or perhaps 334 by tomorrow, to let us have them by 5 o'clock. If he likes, we will put them up on the Internet for everybody to see and we can pore over them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        More seriously, though, it is in contrast to the government's position on disamalgamation and coverage issues, where our policy position is based on two very commonsense rules—firstly, simply that workers have a right to be in a union of their choice and, secondly, that businesses have a right to have effective redress when their business is being threatened by unsanctioned industrial action. It seems from the reports that the shadow minister's view is that, if a business and its employees are being threatened by industrial action and where that industrial action may
        <break page="2059" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         lead to unemployment, then as a result of a demarcation dispute the business must go to the wall, that there should be no effective means of redress.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is even further confusion because it is usually the position of the opposition that the Industrial Relations Commission should be the umpire to decide these issues. Yet, on one of the shadow minister's secret and mysterious amendments, the commission would have no such power. He really ought to make up his mind: which way is it going to be; what exactly is his position? I think the best way for him to perhaps come to grips with some of these issues is to release these amendments so that there can be fair public debate about them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Two other things need to be said which I think evidence the shadow minister's difficulty in coming to grips with these issues. He is wrong on a couple of points. He is critical of the idea of autonomy for union branches. But the fact of the matter is that that is not a new concept. If he knew his current act better, he would know that it was required by the Conciliation and Arbitration Act back in 1904 and, in fact, it was provided for in Labor's own legislation. Our bill simply gives real effect to that proposition. But it is, however, an old concept.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second point where he is particularly wrong is in the proposals the government has with subsection 118(a) and the right of people to choose the union in which they are members. The section relates to coverage, not to membership. So it would be open, for example, for a worker at a site covered by a particular union to appoint another union as their agent to negotiate an Australian workplace agreement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We, in fact, support the right of people to be in a union, and we back it up. But one of the real differences between our policy position and the opposition's policy is that we seek to protect the rights of individual workers. What they do is seek to protect union power to the disadvantage of workers. It is about time he released his secret amendments.

        I join with the member for Charlton in welcoming our American friends. Indeed, if our American government friends whom I had the privilege to meet a couple of hours ago knew the full story, they would advise the same conclusion; namely, in the 1993 elections, then Labor Treasurer Dawkins said that there would be no new taxes and no tax increases. The first budget you produced after the 1993 elections increased taxes in four areas, particularly with regard to fuel excise tax. It was your breach of promise on fuel excise tax which created the framework to enable us to win the election.

        Not even the courtesy of a reply. You were a government that presided over taxation avoidance and you would do nothing about it. I refer the House also to part of the September 1995 newsletter by the Auto Industry of Australia entitled, `The unfair advantage for council car trader'. It says this:

        No government could allow a situation where councils took out motor car licences to take advantage of sales tax exemptions to engage in motor car trading. As the Motor Trades Association said, this was unfair competition. This was an exemption which, in relation to the application of the taxation system, was unfair. This is an exemption which the Labor Party refused to do anything about because you loved this area of tax avoidance. I take it you are still opposed to closing it down. Is that right? Are you opposed to closing it down? You can't even announce a position on this because you know that to announce a position on this would expose the failures you had.

        Any state government that takes the opportunity to raise its taxes takes that responsibility for itself, and it is responsible. If they want to say there is any federal contribution in relation to their taxation regime, they can lay the blame with the person who is really responsible—the Beazley black hole. As the Prime Minister said, a Carr tax out of Beazley.

That initiative was to take effect as of 15 June and was put in action on 15 June—last Saturday. It is designed to ensure that aircraft can land from the south, approaching Sydney's Mascot airport over water, on runways 34L and 34R—the parallel north&amp;hyphen;south runways—whilst at the same time take&amp;hyphen;offs can be operating on the east&amp;hyphen;west runway in a westerly direction. No additional take&amp;hyphen;offs are required to the west, but landings that would otherwise have been coming from the north will now be coming from the south on those two runways—34L and 34R—subject, of course, to certain weather conditions prevailing and also operating during certain hours of each day.

        That initiative is a further fulfilment of the commitments the Liberal and National parties made in opposition that we are now delivering on in government.

The chief of those will follow the complete review of the airspace and flight paths around the Sydney basin area to ensure a greater usage of approaches over water, a greater usage of non&amp;hyphen;residential areas for aircraft flying into Sydney and the possible use of military controlled airspace. All of these initiatives, the culmination of which will occur on 16 December this year, are designed to do two things: firstly, to deliver on our promises made in opposition and, secondly, to overcome the unfair and inequitable distribution of noise that occurred under a Labor government that caused so much distress and harm to people in Sydney.

         —I thank the member for Makin for that question. The findings of the report are a damning indictment of Labor's commitment as enunciated by former Prime Minister Bob Hawke when he declared that no Australian child shall live in poverty by 1990. It is a fact that under Labor there has been a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor and a decline of 25 per cent in the number of households in Australia earning between $22,000 and $72,000 per annum.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact is there has also been a doubling of the number of people earning less than $22,000 per annum. Unemployment and family dislocation are two of the principal causes of growing poverty and of growing social inequality in our community. Younger single people, some of whom live in neighbourhoods where unemployment has exceeded 50 per cent, now make up 25 per cent of all Australians living in poverty. This is not to mention those of the indigenous population for whom employment is not an option in many parts of Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Now there is also Labor's legacy of 600,000 Australian children who live in families with income levels below $22,000 per annum. As the member for Makin has quite rightly pointed out, many of these children come from sole parent families—Labor's legacy. The report findings are a sad testimonial to 13 years of economic mismanagement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        By contrast, this government is committed to the most significant family tax initiatives this country has ever seen. This initiative is targeted at lower and middle income earners, many of whom found it increasingly difficult to make ends meet under the Labor government, as the UNICEF report has quite rightly pointed out. Our policy will mean an extra $21 per week for a single income family of five on average weekly earnings, with at least one child under five.

        In addition, the Prime Minister has recognised homeless youth as a particularly vulnerable group in our community and has

         implemented the homeless youth task force to address this growing problem. This is a practical policy, a practical reform, that will reduce the vulnerability of those young people—and there are some 20,000 of them every night in this country who have to seek shelter and who are, essentially, homeless youth. That is an indictment of 13 years of Labor's policy. Our government's approach is action, not rhetoric and humbug.

The Deputy Prime Minister will recall the government's election commitment to maintain and extend the export market development grants scheme and his categorical statement during the election campaign, `EMDG stays.' Does the Deputy Prime Minister recall meeting the Australian Publishers Association last year? Does he recall giving a clear and unequivocal personal assurance to the association that a coalition government would continue the EMDG scheme? Does the Deputy Prime Minister stand by his assurance or are his assurances worth as much as the assurance of support currently being given to him by his National Party colleagues?

We have a clear-cut policy position and there has been no announcement to the contrary with regard to that. The government has the challenge of working through $8 billion of deficit that has been created, and we are doing that in the fourth consecutive year of economic recovery. That is the chilling point. Ralph Willis, the member for Gellibrand, knows only well enough that it is that dimension which is particularly of concern to any reasonable thinking person. Here we are in the fourth year of economic recovery facing an $8 billion deficit. We have to deal with that as a legacy of a federal Labor government, and we will deal with it constructively.

All that is totally untrue. The fact is that they will be paid what they will be paid now. There will be no change, as we have said on numerous occasions—and the member for La Trobe can take this message back to his electorate—to the payment arrangements that they currently exist under because those arrangements are defined under the awards.

         —I say at the outset how regrettable it is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has decided to absent himself from the chamber for this debate on what is an extraordinarily important issue for the parliament and indeed for all of Australia. It indicates a certain cavalier and irresponsible attitude on his part. I dare say it is entirely consistent with the approach he took yesterday in his thinly veiled attack on the integrity of Richard Woolcott, the Chairman of the Australia-Indonesia Institute.

        All honourable members are aware that the United Nations has declared this year, 1996, as the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. No member of this House should question the necessity for intensifying our international efforts and making every effort possible to eliminate poverty and to alleviate social injustice.

        As the Australian Council for Overseas Aid declares in its submission on this year's overseas aid budget, the persistence of hunger and extreme poverty is the most profound moral and spiritual contradiction of our age. Despite 50 years of great achievement by international foreign aid programs, the gap today between rich and poor continues to grow. Today, in this age of immense economic and technological accomplishment, more than 1.3 billion people survive on an income

        Five hundred million of the world's 800 million most needy people live in the Asia-Pacific region; that is, they live in our region. I put it to the House that the problem of global poverty and social injustice is right here on our doorstep and we as a nation cannot turn our backs against it. It is against that backdrop that the Minister for Foreign Affairs last month established an independent review of Australia's overseas aid programs. In making his announcement, the minister rightly said that Australia has an overseas aid program of which all Australians can be proud. He put this on the record:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Millions of people around the world are now better off thanks to the help they've received from Australia. Our aid program, administered by AusAID and delivered by Australian companies, individuals, non-government organisations and academic institutions is highly effective.
       </para>
       <para>
        They are the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he announced the review. For our part, the opposition welcomed the establishment of the review, chaired as it is by Mr Paul Simons, the former executive chairman of Woolworths. It is our view that, in ever changing international circumstances, the continuous review of Australia's overseas aid program is crucially important for maximising its effectiveness and for making sure that we maintain its primary focus of contributing to lasting poverty reduction whilst also serving Australia's international interests.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Although many individual Australian aid programs and projects have been subject to comprehensive review down through the years, it is now some years since the Jackson report on Australia's overall aid program. We readily agreed that the new review established by the government is an appropriate and timely one to take place in this International Year for the Eradication of Poverty.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What the Minister for Foreign Affairs declined to mention when he announced his review was that, as a consequence of the government's ruthless slash and burn approach to the aid budget, Australia's commitment to provide development assistance and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         to alleviate poverty in and beyond our region is about to fall to its lowest level in more than 20 years; that is, it will fall to below 0.3 per cent of one per cent of our gross national product. As I pointed out when the minister made his announcement, any review will be a farce if the job of the review team is simply to pick up the pieces after the government has taken the axe to our overseas aid programs. Alternatively, the real purpose of the review may be just that: to work out what might be done with a greatly reduced aid budget.

       <para first-indent="16">
        On our side of the House, we are proud that Labor increased aid spending in real terms in each of our last six budgets. In 1995-96, we provided just over $1.5 billion; that is, 0.33 per cent of GNP. That is a proportionate decline only because of the rapid growth of the Australian economy, but it is a real increase in dollar terms and a substantial improvement on the OECD average of 0.3 of one per cent. That is the truth of it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under Labor, Australia was one of only four OECD donor countries to increase its aid budget in real terms. We did it year after year and we are immensely proud of it. In the lead-up to this year's federal election, the coalition publicly reiterated its support for the bipartisan UN goal of applying 0.7 per cent of GNP to overseas aid. For Australia to meet our international obligations and show Australia's international good citizenship, the government must demonstrate a serious commitment to achieving the UN target with, at the very least, annual real increases in the aid program as urged by ACFOA.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The abolition of the development improvement finance facility program was announced by the coalition during the election campaign long before any fatuous talk about budget black holes. If the money saved by the abolition is removed from the overall aid program rather than redirected to other parts of the program, it will represent a 7.9 per cent cut to Australia's aid program. That will be the first time that we will have seen Australia's overseas aid program fall to below 0.3 per cent of one per cent. It will have fallen to 0.29 per cent of GNP. It will be the first time in history that our Australian aid level has fallen below the weighted OECD average. No

        The foreign affairs minister has spoken at length about the need to respond to humanitarian concerns. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has promised to protect the needy against his government's budget cuts, but those words clearly count for nothing when the foreign minister has already axed the DIFF scheme without any reallocation of funds to other programs. Indeed, he is reported to have accepted the need for further aid cuts as deep as 25 per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What is perhaps most astonishing is the preparedness of the government to proceed on this course of action, which is so contrary to its stated commitment to achieve lasting poverty reduction and is so detrimental to our regional engagement. The across&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;board axing of DIFF funded aid programs without any evaluation of the merits of individual programs or recognition of the serious consequences for Australia has received near universal condemnation. It has been condemned universally both at home and abroad.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Thanks to the government's actions, Australia now faces a major regional backlash and serious damage to our international credibility as our neighbours are forced to cancel important development projects, including programs for the provision of clean water and electricity in rural and remote areas. In many cases, the recipient countries have already invested significant funds themselves. Those investments have been made on the assumption of the good faith of the Australian government.

        Across the region, our neighbours are being told that understandings reached in good faith count for nothing in the calculations of the new Australian government. It is little wonder that China, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines have all made official protests through their ambassadors and at our embassies throughout the region. As I pointed out in question time today, the Chinese ambassador has left the government in no doubt that the scrapping of DIFF projects in China will do Australia no good in terms of our credibility or business interests. Representations have been made by the Chinese government, irrespective of whether the minister admits it, at a vice&amp;hyphen;ministerial level on at least four occasions. They have sought a reversal of the government's decision to cut over 50 per cent of Australia's aid to China.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Similarly, the Philippines ambassador has stated publicly that the decision to scrap DIFF creates a perception that Australia was not serious in its engagement in the region, while senior Indonesian officials in Jakarta have said Australia is `shooting itself in the foot' by scrapping DIFF. In eastern Indonesia this is most certainly the case. The 21 environmental monitoring laboratories that I mentioned earlier were to be equipped by Australian companies. That work will now almost certainly go to Japanese competitors.

        That is what he said. But with the axing of DIFF, Japanese scientific equipment will become the benchmark for environmental monitoring in Indonesia, and Australia will effectively be locked out of this key export market.

        It is very hard to see the logic of the decision to scrap DIFF. It is absolutely impossible to see the logic as it affects the 52 individual projects in the DIFF pipeline. The comprehensive effectiveness review of the
        <break page="2077" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         program, the one conducted by AusAID with the assistance of independent consultants, released only in January this year, found that the vast majority of the projects carried out under DIFF contributed to the overall economic and social advancement of the recipient countries and met the primary objectives of our aid program.

        Moreover, the review found that DIFF had generated substantial commercial benefits for Australia. Almost all firms surveyed stated that DIFF had been important to their business, with half stating that it was either crucial or very important to their operations. Combined with funding from the Export Finance Insurance Corporation, the 51 projects examined in the review—involving some $285 million of AusAID funds—generated direct project expenditure in Australia worth $709 million.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition, follow-up business already won by the companies and directly related to the original DIFF project was estimated at $263 million, and the firms predicted a further $397 million of follow-on business to be achieved over the year following the survey. Total business generated as a result of the projects is therefore estimated at $1.37 billion or almost five times the original aid expenditure. For many Australian companies a DIFF project was also their first overseas contract. As a consequence, they changed their focus from solely concentrating on our domestic market to including a significant export orientation in their activities.

        For every dollar invested in DIFF, Australia received a fivefold return while contributing directly to long-term alleviation of poverty and economic development in the region. Unfortunately, however, DIFF is no more, though the government—and it is no surprise—has told companies that it may consider the establishment of a similar arrangement in the future. In the meantime, however, total Australian commercial losses on the projects in the DIFF pipeline resulting from the government's decision are estimated to exceed $67 million.

Across the country some 600 subcontractors are estimated to be affected—a state of affairs which makes an absolute mockery of the Prime Minister's statement that the government supports small and medium business. There is little wonder that the decision to scrap DIFF has been universally condemned by Australian businessmen and by such commentators as Bert Evans of the Metal Trades Industry Association, who described its abolition as `foolish' and as `the most short&amp;hyphen;sighted thing' he had seen in his career.

At the same time, the impact on Australian jobs has aroused condemnation from a coalition of opinion including business, aid organisations, union leaders, conservative state premiers and ordinary Australians who believe our nation should play its part and pull its weight.

He promised during the 1993 election campaign that the then government would lift the aid budget as a percentage of Australia's GNP from 0.36 per cent to 0.4 per cent during the period 1993 to 1996, where we find ourselves today.

        We said at the time that such a commitment could not be believed or trusted and, of course, he denied that.

This time it was Senator Evans—Senator Gary Evans as he is to be known henceforth, or Mr Gary Evans, the member for Holt—who said in a prepared speech that he delivered on 23 February—

        Back to the member for Holt: he said in this prepared speech that he committed the Labor Party to increasing the aid budget, again as a percentage of GNP, from 0.33 per cent to 0.4 per cent by the year 2000—once again, the same target of 0.4 per cent—and in doing so he drew a distinction between a commitment and a mere aspiration. I quote from his speech at the time:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        We retain the aspiration to continue real increases in aid to reach the UN target for official development assistance of 0.7 per cent of GNP, and the commitment to at least get to 0.40 per cent by the year 2000 . . .

        That is a pretty clear commitment. But the problem that this poses is that, to fulfil such a commitment, the Labor Party in government would have had to find an extra $1.2 billion. It would have needed $1.2 billion extra money, unfunded, to meet that commitment of 0.4 per cent.

He asked the House to ask itself how important this issue is to the opposition and why it was that the first question in this House about this scheme was made 98 days after this government was sworn in, despite the terrible consequences that the shadow minister alludes to—all this wailing and gnashing of teeth across the Asian region. This must have been plain from the moment we made the announcement during the campaign that we would abolish it. But no, it took 98 days and it was the 140th question.

        That said, let me talk a little more about why we settled on DIFF as what we were going to abolish. Quite plainly, you can sum it up in two words: fiscal discipline. Budgetary health is quite plainly the prerequisite for economic health and competitiveness in this region and the reduction of real interest rates. Having been in private enterprise for a while, I know that what a business has to pay for money is a serious cost to any business. The consequence of a country borrowing too much or a government being too profligate is
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         always that the companies, the enterprises and the individuals within that economy must pay more for money.

        It is plain to us and to the opposition, though they are loath to admit it, that we face very serious problems with the current account deficit and with our savings ratio. In order to arrest the trend of national dis&amp;hyphen;saving, we have to take some hard decisions in making reductions to all portfolio areas of the federal government, bar the defence budget. In saying so, we are quite clear that the aid budget cannot be quarantined from this sort of austerity. There is no reason why, in trying to reclaim some of the next generation's assets that have already been spent by the previous government, we should spare the aid budget when we are making the same difficult and hard decisions in other areas, especially where it delivers political pain to Australia in domestic terms. So fiscal discipline is quite plainly necessary if Australia is going to engage effectively in this region and if it is going to be a strong and growing trading nation.

        More particularly, the review did not ask whether or not DIFF supported activity was actually better or worse than other activity. For example, most of the projects in the DIFF pipeline—even in the latter days of DIFF—were infrastructure projects that took place in spoiled markets. Those spoiled markets are where companies, especially French, German and Japanese companies, competed for these projects with subsidies—subsidies which, in some cases, were not just from their federal governments but from their state governments. So it is fair for Australian parliamentarians to ask ourselves whether we should always be there with our cheque book in these spoiled markets.

When you look at other activities that take place as part of the aid program where we have to make a choice of what to cut, what should we cut? Should we cut the HIV&amp;hyphen;AIDS programs for people in Thailand, Papua New Guinea or the Pacific? These, in my opinion, are of far more immediate consequence to Australians and deserve a higher priority than any form of mixed credit scheme. Or should we make budget cuts to programs which support the education of women and girls? Should we do that?

        We have to set a list of priorities in this, and it is the problems of health, immediate poverty and sickness that strike us as deserving a higher priority than mixed credit schemes. That is why the minister said that, if there is room and if budgetary circumstances permit—that is, if we do our job in this year's budget and restore some rectitude to the federal budget—down the track, in the financial year after next, we may be able to reintroduce a form of mixed credit scheme and resume some of the projects that were in the pipeline. If it was the case that after the election we had been left with a budget that

I do not believe we would be responsible if we were to say, `We're going to cut the aid programs to these poor children and their families; we're going to take away the support for these people who are suffering from HIV, but we're going to continue to provide subsidies to Transfield, while we're battling in the domestic economy to bring this country back to proper management again.'

         If the opposition wants the government to be judged, the judgment will be that we will be encouraged by our regional neighbours for our forthrightness in saying before the election what our policies would be, for our initiative in having the review that should lead to very effective aid programs of the future and for being absolutely honest and pragmatic in saying that, in the case of humanitarian programs, when money is short, the Australian taxpayer wants the AIDS victims to be assisted first, before business.

         —We are dealing with the Customs Amendment Bill 1966 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1966. We support the Customs Amendment Bill 1966. In essence, it gives effect to what the Labor government proposed to do in the innovation statement toward the end of last year. We will be opposing the second bill, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1966. The reason we are opposing it is that it introduces a consumer tax—a GST on imports—and represents a massive breach of promise on the part of the government that is now bringing it forward. Just to remind people of what that promise was, I refer them to what the now Treasurer (Mr Costello) had to say at the Press Club last year:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        But what I am saying here is, we'll not be hiking the income tax rates or company tax rates or sales tax rates or extending the sales tax in any way that
        <break page="2087" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the government is proposing. That is not our agenda. It is not our agenda to introduce new taxes. It is not our agenda to bulk up the currently existing taxes. That's not our agenda.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I might also say that in the course of the election campaign that oft&amp;hyphen;repeated statement was made again by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer, `There will be no new taxes and no increases in taxes under a coalition government.' Yet today in question time we saw many examples of how those taxes are going to be increased under a coalition government. I will refer to those in a minute. I simply make the point that the reason we are opposing the element of this bill is that it extends the tariff concession order effectively to consumers which means an increased tax to consumers and, therefore, is a breach of election commitment to those consumers.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not the first time that the government has breached this commitment. There are least two other occasions on which the commitment of `no new taxes' has been breached so far, and we have not even got a budget. Those opposite went to the last election saying that there would be no new taxes, yet there have been breaches now on at least three occasions. What are those three occasions? The one we are dealing with today, which I will come to in more detail in a minute, introduces by the back door a GST of three per cent on all imports—a complete breach of the government's election commitment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         The other breach occurred when they introduced a tax on building workers' travelling allowances. We know this government does not like trade unionists and that during the last election they promised that no&amp;hyphen;one would be worse off, but by eliminating that exemption they effectively raised the tax of building workers. Members would be aware of significant demonstrations by building workers around this country because of that decision. But it is not just the building workers who are reacting to this. I understand from a newspaper report late last week that the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, Mr Collins, has written to the govern ment expressing concern about this decision and the impact that it will have in New South Wales. The simple fact needs to be underlined that these allowances were not taxed before this government came to power. They now are taxed and, apart from the fact that this breaches the government's promise of no new taxes, it also breaches the commitment that no worker will be worse off.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other place where we have seen a massive backdown by the coalition on their election promises was in the farcical Premiers Conference last week. It was referred to by the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, as the greatest shambles of a conference that he had ever participated in. It was referred to by the Premier of Queensland, Mr Borbidge, as representing the duplicity and the deceit of the Treasurer in trying to put something over them that he had not had the decency to come to talk to them about before. All these people are members of coalition governments in other states, I might add. The Treasurer of Victoria said that the decision on wholesale sales tax on cars was a breach of an election promise. It was a breach on at least three fronts according to the Premier of South Australia, and on five fronts according to the Victorian Treasurer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These people are not friends of Labor. You would have thought that they would have been allies of the current coalition government. Even they could not accept the fact that the government was seeking to introduce new taxes despite their election pledge that there would be no new taxes. I will repeat what they said during the election campaign and obviously well before it, `There will be no new taxes and new increases in taxes under a coalition government.' If one reads the reports in today's newspaper, what are the implications for the states after the fiasco that was the Premiers Conference last week? The coalition government failed to get its proposed tax increase through on motor vehicles because of the disastrous consequence it was going to have on the motor industry, quite apart from what it was going to cost the states.

        A compromise was hammered out. Who is going to pay for that compromise? The people
        <break page="2088" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         who are going to pay for that compromise are the residents in each of the states. In the case of New South Wales, we are looking at $100 per household per year being levied on council rates. Over three years—that is how long they are going to be collecting it—that amounts to $300 per household. This is Pete's poll tax. This is the Treasurer's poll tax.

         —The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 states an evaluation was conducted in 1995 into changes to the tariff concession system. The evaluation found that, while the system made concessions available for importers, Australian manufacturers were being adversely affected by its operation. The evaluation concluded that tariff concessions should be made only where there is no Australian manufacturer of goods substitutable for those imported. The aim of this bill is to align the operation of the system and make concessional entry readily available without adversely affecting the tariff assistance given to Australian manufacturers.

        The policy by&amp;hyphen;law system will be revamped to contain costs. The decision overcomes the unfair and unworkable proposal—put forward by the former government—to totally abolish tariff concessions on business inputs. Labor's proposal would have created an administrative nightmare. It would also have unfairly penalised Australian manufacturers by imposing higher costs on business inputs while at the same time competing inputs were to benefit from a reduction in the general tariff.

        The coalition solution is a pragmatic response to the concerns of industry. It spreads the cost more widely and provides relief to key industries that would have suffered under Labor's proposal. For example, under Labor's proposal the car industry and the textile, clothing and footwear industry would have had to contend with an increase in tariff paid on imported components and materials from zero up to 15 per cent, even 25 per cent and in some cases 37 per cent.

        The proposed revocation of the five policy by&amp;hyphen;law items and the introduction of the revised criteria against which requests for concessions under these items will be considered will result in considerable revenue savings. It is expected that, in the 1996-97 budget year, these will be $29 million; in 1997-98, $32 million; in 1998-99, $34 million; and in 1999&amp;hyphen;2000, $37 million.

        The changes in the tariff concession system arise from the government's election commitments and acceptance of tariff concession system reforms recommended in 1995 by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. The most important change is the removal of the so&amp;hyphen;called market test clause from the core criteria. The existence of the market test has meant that tariff concession orders have been granted to the detriment of Australian manufacturers, because it is very difficult for an Australian manufacturer to prove prospectively that the market for its goods will be adversely affected by the duty&amp;hyphen;free importation of substitutable goods.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Once the market test has been removed, the substitutability test will be the remaining core criterion. Therefore, the Australian Customs Service will not grant a tariff concession order where it is satisfied that substitutable goods are produced in Australia. Concessions will be made only where there is no Australian manufacturer of goods substitutable for those which are subject to the tariff concession application.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The present legislation allows the commencement date of a tariff concession to be backdated to 28 days before the lodgment of application. There is now no rationale for backdating tariff concession orders. Making orders operative from the date of lodgment of application should encourage importers to lodge their applications earlier. The bill will also enable Customs to commence revocation action for tariff concession orders where there are Australian manufacturers of substitutable goods and where the orders have not been used for two years.

        We are not prepared to allow, in any way, this dishonest exercise of trying to misuse this bill by bringing in a certain kind of consumption tax that would cover a significant number of goods which the Australian people certainly made clear in the 1993 election that they rejected.

        It is interesting that a quiet debate is going on within the government on this issue. This government consists—in philosophical terms—of people who are pragmatic and relatively moderate and then those who have absorbed the Fightback New Right agenda put down by the former leader and who are really trying to bring that agenda to pass. Even though John Howard, the Prime Minister, when he went to the Australian people, said, `We are not introducing a GST and we have rejected the key elements of Fightback,' what we are increasingly getting is policy after policy with elements of Fightback ideas coming in—and in this case a GST.

He has tried to bring it in in a number of ways: by creating this mythology of the $8 billion hole and using this mythology as an excuse to break all the promises which Mr Howard, as Prime Minister, made in relation to services.

They are now trying to bring in excuses to bring in that agenda. Here is another example. In this bill we effectively have the introduction of a consumption tax. It is totally unnecessary. We suggested the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) as a way of gaining some revenue in a responsible way. Instead of proceeding along the path suggested by the Labor Party, the government accepted part of the Labor Party's approach but then added on this other stuff—the consumption tax. Instead of agreeing to the original proposal, which even the honourable member who spoke on their behalf a little while ago said had reasonable elements to it in that business was required to give something back because they had received so much in tariff concessions—

Why was he forced to back off on his proposal regarding the imposition of new taxes? Leaving aside the fact that it was clearly a breach of a promise by the government that it would not impose new taxes, he failed in the most fundamental rule of administration. Even a junior minister would know that, if you are going to bring in something like that, there is a such a thing as consultation with people to see what the situation is.

It is wrong. We consider the onus to be on the government to produce the bill in a proper state.

          —Okay, I will come to the consumption side. What you were prepared to do was increase the cost by five per cent for all inputs imported into Australia for Australian businesses. That measure would disadvantage Australian manufacturers as compared with imported goods. You were not going to put anything on an equivalent good made outside the country and directly imported to the consumer. Therefore, you were prepared to tolerate a price differential of at least five per cent to the disadvantage of Australian manufacturers, Australian workers and Australian industries. You were prepared to promote that as a good decision and as a responsible decision. You were prepared to accept an additional five per cent input cost for Australian manufacturers and put them at a severe disadvantage against imports.

         That has been the life story of 13 years of Australian Labor Party government. Slowly but surely, as they proclaim the increase and betterment of Australian industries and Australian manufacturing industries, they ground them into the dust. For every year that the Labor Party proclaimed themselves to be the supporters of Australian manufacturing industries and Australian workers, more and more went bankrupt. Here was another decision in line with previous decisions of the Australian Labor Party where they were prepared to increase the costs for Australian businesses and disadvantage them as compared with imported goods.

          disadvantaging Australian workers as compared with workers in Asia, in Europe or in South America. Their proposal in 1995 regarding tariff concessions was that inputs into the plastics industries, the auto industries, tool making and most Australian manufacturing industries were to be increased by five per cent. A five per cent increase along the line of a charge is then multiplied as that item, that good or that equipment and machinery is added into production costs. So a five per cent downstream input charge can finish up as a substantial increase in the finished price of the goods.

They knew that, if the Australian Labor Party's proposal had been successful, there would have been a serious price disadvantage for locally manufactured goods. That is the complaint of the whole of Australia.

         There is a difference between the way in which the two main parties operate. There was no willingness on the part of the Australian Labor Party to look at the penalties and disadvantages in the industrial relation system. The proposals of the former Minister for Industrial Relations, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), on unfair dismissal wrecked business after business. The complaint right through the community was that business was disadvantaged in comparison with its neighbours. Labor's tariff concession proposals did exactly the same thing. They were prepared to penalise Australian manufacturers with an extra charge but they would not put a compensatory charge on all imports. They disadvantaged the price of goods that were manufactured locally and advantaged the price of goods that were manufactured overseas.

         The tack taken by the Australian Labor Party that this is a new tax is very strange. This legislation is not a new tax. In 1978 the Fraser government put a two per cent tariff across everything with a few exceptions. Just about all imports to Australia faced a two per cent tariff increase.

         That process remained in place for nine or 10 years.

We're quite entitled to put five per cent on Australian manufacturers. We took off the two per cent of the Fraser government.' At that time the Labor government had proclaimed the Fraser government's two per cent as an unnecessary burden on

Students, upon graduation, become liable for payment of part of their fees, about 20 per cent, when they hit certain income levels. Senator Vanstone is contemplating increasing that HECS charge. I think it is quite devious of the government to suggest, `We can increase the HECS charge on students but this is not increasing a tax.'

         —In rising to speak on the Customs Amendment Bill 1966 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1966, I have the honour of representing the electorate of Kennedy which produces probably $2,000 million annually in export earnings from mining and a further $1,000 million—arguably, $2,000 million—from agriculture as well. If we are talking about $3,000 million a year in export earnings from that very small proportion of the Australian population, then clearly we take very seriously the imposition of an extra three per cent cost upon our industries and their international competitiveness.

        Let us look at our mining and agricultural industries in Australia today. The sad fact is that in the four years leading up to 1989&amp;hyphen;90 there was a growth in agriculture of 14 per cent over that period. Similarly, there was a
        <break page="2103" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         growth of 25 per cent in mining. Over a four&amp;hyphen;year period these two giant industries increased by 14 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. If you go back through time, they are the average figures that you will find in those two industries. Every four years there is an increase of about 10 per cent to 20 per cent in our earnings from those two sectors of the economy.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Over the last four years leading up to the 1993&amp;hyphen;94 financial year, instead of getting a 14 per cent increase for agriculture all we got was a 1.9 per cent increase. In other words, growth in the agricultural sector has stopped completely. Instead of getting a 25 per cent increase in production and income from mining, all we got was a 3.6 per cent increase. In real terms there has been a decline in income from mining and agriculture over the last four years—one of the very rare times that has happened in our history. I daresay you would have to go back to the time of the Great Depression to find a precedent for that situation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not wish to canvass tonight the reasons for that dramatic collapse in our export industries. I point out to the House that our former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, used to make scathing reference to Australia no longer being an extended quarry or a giant sheep run. These comments, of course, were untrue. I simply refer to the heading `Exports of major commodities' which appears in table 2 on page 3. If you go through the list of those commodities you will find that the income from agriculture is 29 per cent and that from mining is 64 per cent. In other words, the much maligned extended sheep run and giant quarry that Mr Keating so happily used to refer to are supplying 93 per cent of the nation's entire income. But that income is drying up. Instead of an increase every four years of 14 per cent and 25 per cent respectively, we now have an increase of 1.9 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively. I urge the government to please understand that saddling these industries with extra cost structures is not the direction in which we should be travelling.

         —It would be fairly hypocritical for you to say true when your mob had a five per cent increase in the pipeline. I would not be butting in and provoking me if I were you. One of the ways exporting industries in Australia are punished is through punitively high interest rates—they are still around 12&amp;half; per cent for business loans. We find ourselves competing against countries like the United States whose business loans last time I looked—that was some time ago, I must admit—were around six per cent. The net result of this enormously high interest rate is propping up the Australian dollar. When you are trading at a loss of nearly $2,000 million every month and the value of your dollar is rising there is something very wrong with the way the economy is operating.

        I am known for not hesitating to make criticism where criticism is due, but I do not in any way wish my remarks to be construed against the Treasurer (Mr Costello) because it is very early days yet. I think it would be irresponsible for him to take precipitate action, in terms of his portfolio responsibility, as early as the present moment.

        I urge the Treasurer and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), who is in the chamber, to point out to the frontbench that we have very high interest rates in Australia. For over a decade we have had an enormously high interest rate regime which has artificially propped up the Australian dollar. I am on record applauding Mr Keating when he floated the Australian dollar. We knew it would sink, and sink it did. It sank from around 100c in the American dollar to 59c in 1986.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That enormous collapse in the Australian dollar scared the hell out of Treasury. It raised interest rates to enormously high levels—in excess of 20 per cent—and it started buying Australian dollars on the world market. I am not saying that there was not a case for propping it up a bit at the time. When the Australian dollar was allowed to free float, it immediately sunk to 59c. That was when this country had a debt of around $60,000 million. This country now has a debt many times greater than $60,000 million. It is some three times that figure.

         If when the debt was only $60,000 million and we were trading a lot more successfully than we are at present—our current account was nowhere near as high as it is now—and the Australian dollar still sank to 69c, then clearly if it were allowed to free float when we owe nearly $200,000 million and our current account deficit is nearly $2,000 million a month it would sink well below 59c. I do not think anyone looking at the figures would seriously believe that the Australian dollar, if allowed to free float, would rise any higher than 50c.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Since the dollar is hovering just below 80c that means that all of our exporting industries are being cheated to the tune of about 50 per cent of their present incomes. We are talking here about huge amounts of money. In the electorate of Kennedy, if we assume that we are exporting in excess of $3,000 million worth of product a year, that means we are being cheated out of $1.5 thousand million per year. If the dollar comes down to 50c then we will receive 50 per cent more for our product than we are receiving now. Heaven only knows, the cattle producers and the wool producers of Australia could desperately use that money.

         The copper industry is facing upheavals as a result of the machinations of speculators in the international marketplace. There have been a lot of articles about what has happened in the copper industry. One copper mine in Mount Isa earns some $1.3 thousand million a year. That mine would have an increase in its income of around $500 million or $600 million a year. A town like Mount Isa, which has suffered a lot of pain over recent years, could desperately utilise that money. I always make the point that if the unions are doing their job then that money should flow down to the average worker and employee in Mount Isa and circulate in the economy of that town.

         When we look at the western parts of Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, we see so many towns in a desperate state of decline, so many industries on the ropes after the body blow imposed upon them, yet we have a tool at our disposal right now to help them which is simply a reduction in interest rates. That would bring

          down the Australian dollar. If they got a fair go and if we stopped a practice that is grossly unfair to the exporting sectors of the Australian economy, which is based in regional Australia—that is, this constant propping up of the Australian dollar—it would result in an increase in income to every single western community of some 40 or 50 per cent.

         One can argue that the customs tariff bill only imposes a tax of three per cent on a small percentage of the cost structures of our mining and farming enterprises in Australia. That is true. We saw an increase in fuel taxes of some 20 or 30 per cent in real terms over the last decade imposed by the ALP government. We saw a 100 per cent, and in some cases a 200 per cent, increase in land rates for our pastoral industries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Each of these small cost impositions is eating away at our international competitiveness and imposing cost burdens which are rendering these industries non&amp;hyphen;viable. We see today that probably one&amp;hyphen;third of our pastoralists in Queensland, our cattle and sheep men, are in an almost terminal situation financially. We look forward to the coming debt summit which will try to help us. I emphasise the point that, while each of these little items may be small in itself, taken collectively, they indicate a huge increase in the cost burden placed upon rural industries in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To turn to agriculture for one small moment to compare our cost competitiveness in Australia with that of our major international agricultural competitor, the United States, let us go through each of the cost input items to farming. The first one is a sad reflection upon the industry, because the biggest cost input to farming is interest rates. As I said before, the last time I looked, the United States farmer enjoyed interest rates of around six per cent, and our farmers' rates are 12 per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break page="2105" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          The next cost input item—and I am proud of this fact, not ashamed of it, as it is an excellent thing—is labour costs of $10.50 per hour in the state of Queensland. I imagine they are roughly the same in the other states of Australia. California, the biggest agricultural state in the United States, enjoys labour costs of $4 per hour: less than half the cost in Australia. That is not something to be asham ed of; it is something to be proud of. All the same, it is a 100 per cent higher cost imposition than that in the United States.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The third cost input item in the state of Queensland, and also, I think, in New South Wales, is water. Again, in the largest US agricultural state, California, water cost $3.90 per megalitre, the last time I checked up on the figures. It costs $29 per megalitre in Queensland, a nearly 1,000 per cent difference. The fourth item is fuel and, even if we take the tax off fuel, it costs 42c per litre in Queensland—or in Australia, if you like. In the United States, fuel costs 26c per litre. Finally, the fifth major cost input item is fertiliser. In the United States, urea costs $206 per tonne; in Australia, it costs $396 per tonne.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Every single one of those cost input items is between 40 and 1,000 per cent higher than those of our competitor, the United States. People say that we should do something about that, but it is impossible for the farmer to do anything about the cost of water, since the government sets the cost of water. It is impossible for the farmer to do anything—not that he wants to—about the cost of labour, because that is set by the government. It is impossible for the farmer to do anything about interest rates, because they are set by the Reserve Bank.

         I would argue very cogently that our failure to legislate for the oil industry is the major reason that there is such a huge cost difference between ourselves and the United States, where they enjoy the benefits of the really wonderful anti&amp;hyphen;trust legislation introduced by Theodore Roosevelt specifically to smash up the oil companies in the United States. We do not enjoy such magnificent legislation in Australia. That is why we pay 42c per litre for our fuel and the United States farmer pays 25c per litre for his fuel. I would say that similar anti&amp;hyphen;trust legislation—or anti&amp;hyphen;monopoly legislation, as we call it here in Australia—for the fertiliser industry would also see a dramatic reduction in the inexplicable difference between the cost of fertiliser in the United States and the cost of fertiliser here.

         The biggest town in the electorate of Kennedy, Mount Isa, has suffered a population decline of probably a third of its population. Most certainly it was over 30,000 and now it is hovering around 20,000. The reason for that is that Mount Isa Mines has just had to adopt almost skeleton staffing levels because times have been very, very tough in the mining industry. One of the reasons times are tough is the cost impositions applied by government in this country.

It is incomprehensible to me, but even in Thailand farmers and industry enjoy subsidy levels of nearly 100 per cent, which is extraordinary, but that is the reality. They enjoy a price that is twice as high as the world price of sugar, and that is paid to them by the government.

As is my right, I made a brief passing comment to it. Having cleared up that issue, let me say that it is amazing how this government thinks that the electorate is gullible. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, this was the government that said that there would be no new taxes. Although the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) referred to the `read my lips' line, it is not quite the same as `read my lips'.

        Much was made of that promise in the electorate. When I went around the electorate during the election campaign, I was told that the then opposition had embraced all the policies that Labor had been embracing for 10 years, and the one thing that was constantly put to me when I went around to workshops and other places in my electorate was that this government was the government that was going to have no new taxes. However, it has many new taxes.

        In the days of the election campaign, the then opposition members, especially the leader, now the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), were running around the country, appearing nightly on television and being quoted in the newspapers promising no new taxes. As I said, there is going to be a tax that was not there. It is a tax of three per cent on something like 17,000 items. It is a GST on consumer imports, but the government will not tell the people, or indeed us, just what items are going to be slugged with this three per cent tax.

        So not only is it a consumption tax, but it is also a mystery tax—a little bit like Russian roulette. The consumer buys something and, bingo, he gets a prize.

        The government's decision to extend the changes to the tariff concessions will mean that all consumers will now pay the government three per cent more on the purchase of a vast range of products—some 17,000. It is a very wide&amp;hyphen;ranging list of items, including electrical appliances, sporting equipment, and even gym equipment. Those who go to the gym here each morning to exercise, such as the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and others, would find that if those items were being purchased now, there would be an additional three per cent tax on them. Musical instruments, domestic hardware and a whole range of things are included on the list.

        As I keep saying, and as other members have said, it is important to remind the people of this. The Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, and the now Treasurer (Mr Costello) gave a categorical assurance to the Australian people that there would be no new taxes, no increase in taxes and no changes to the tax mix—and that last one is very important. Within three months, the government has blatantly broken that promise with what, in effect, is a GST on imports. Every time families go to the toy store or the domestic appliance store, they will find the Treasurer's hand in their pockets.

        It is very interesting how this change came about. When it was first mooted, it was going to be a tax on business. There was an outcry from the business groups to change the decision to remove tariff concessions from business imports. Indeed, one of the coalition ministers actually admitted that it was dreadful to tax business. The government decided not to tax business, but it is going to tax the consumers instead. The mates are going to be supported, but the poor old consumer is going to be hit again and will have to pay this tax.

        A range of items is going to be taxed—some 17,000. Although these 17,000 goods will have a three per cent tax on them, there will be no tax at all on some goods coming through customs at Australian ports. I refer specifically to drugs, pornography and firearms. Why will there be no tax on them? It is

        This is very important because we are going to have officials in Customs checking on some goods to make sure that three per cent is paid income. However, other ports such as Port Kembla, which is one of Australia's busiest ports, will not be so lucky because the customs officers there have been decreased from 12 to five as part of a review of shift work designed to save money. Customs officers will no longer work on weekends or at night time at Port Kembla or Newcastle even though ships are often unloading at these hours. A reduced number of staff will be on duty at Sydney wharves. As one customs officer put it, `You'd have to be dead unlucky to get caught bringing something in during office hours, let alone at the weekend.'

        The minister has said that the new Customs Service will work through high quality intelligence and surveillance that will happen outside of office hours. They will have some sort of surveillance camera. But what will happen if someone comes in on a Friday evening? The surveillance camera will capture it but the customs officers will not be able to pick it up until Monday morning at 9 a.m. So the surveillance camera will capture unidentified people leaving the wharf on the Friday evening, but it will not be until Monday morning that anything can be done about it.

        There has been much talk here and in the media about the credibility of politics and politicians. Former opposition members had a very strong platform throughout the election campaign that there would be no new taxes. There is now a question regarding their credibility. Do they take the people of Australia as fools? How can we, as politicians, have any credibility when we tell people that there will be no new taxes and then break that promise? Some members of the government have said today that this is not really a tax.

        As a tax, it is completely contrary to the coalition's tax promise. They were the party prior to the election that would never introduce a new tax. They would not change the tax mix; they would not increase any tax. But barely 100 days into the Howard government we have a broken tax promise before the parliament which will place a three per cent tax on consumers. All those valuable items in the households, in the pubs and clubs and on the sporting fields of Australia are to be levied with an additional three per cent tax. This government has decided, contrary to its election promise and what the former government was intending, to place a three per cent tax on consumer goods imported to Australia where similar goods are not produced within this country.

But we know too well that this is the standard tory method in Australia for breaking promises. It was patented by Nick Greiner in New South Wales in 1988 and was then tried on in Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia.

        Tomorrow, we are having the report of the Commission of Audit. It will be bodgied up to try to legitimise things, to try to create the alibi by which this coalition government can break its promises. But the truth has come out: when the member for Higgins, the Treasurer (Mr Costello), made the allegation on 12 March, he said that the parameters had changed and that the problem was that the forecasted growth had slowed. The problem has now been corrected by the March quarter national accounts and, apparently, growth is going gang&amp;hyphen;busters. Even the Prime Minister has acknowledged as much in a very open account to the international bankers when he said that the Australian economy was in good shape. Let me quote from that conference in Sydney on 3 June. The member for Bennelong had this to say:

        The Australian people are quite entitled to ask this basic question: if things are so good and the Australian economy is in such good shape, why do the cuts need to be so big?

       <para first-indent="16">
        The government is seeking an alibi, an alibi that the Prime Minister has blown with his admission that things are in good shape. There is no reason to break the government's tax promises. We are now to believe that the five minutes of economic sunshine that the

         Prime Minister spoke of in 1995 have turned into the year's longest day of economic growth, the longest growth cycle in the nation's modern history. We have also had an understanding in recent times of the $3 billion hole that the coalition has dug for itself with its uncosted election promises. So much for transparency on the budget! The government will not release the Department of Finance costings on the $3 billion worth of coalition election commitments made prior to 2 March.

        The other interesting thing in relation to the fiscal position is that the coalition itself, throughout the course of 1995, became the poachers in the Senate, knocking $2.3 billion of revenue off the Commonwealth budget. The poachers, of course, have come into this House and said that they are the gamekeepers. But the gamekeepers are the ones trying to bodgie up an alibi by which they can break their promises to the Australian people. It was the member for Bennelong, supported by the member for Higgins, who throughout the election campaign chanted across the nation their mantra of no new taxes and no tax increases. They did everything within their power to chant that mantra—everything, bar asking the Australian people to read their lips.

        Indeed, at the Press Club before the election, the member for Higgins said, `It is not our agenda to introduce new taxes. It is not our agenda to bulk up currently existing taxes.' Bulk up?

This legislation reveals very starkly one fundamental truth in Australian politics, and that is this: how can anyone take the coalition's mandate seriously, if the coalition does not itself respect it?

The coalition has always claimed a mandate on those issues, but it has no mandate on any issue unless it is prepared to respect its own promises. It is an absolute act of disrespect to the

        What we are seeing is broken promise after broken promise. It was very interesting, in relation to this question, to recall the words of the Prime Minister on the John Laws program just before the election. He was asked, `If you were given a choice between keeping all your promises and running down the budget or breaking promises and bringing the budget back into surplus, what would you choose?' The Prime Minister said very clearly that, given that choice, he would keep his promises at any cost to the budget. That proves one basic thing: you cannot trust the Prime Minister on his promise to keep his promises. That is how bad it is. He is breaking his promise to keep his promise on no new taxes. This is a three per cent consumption tax that is being levied across most of the sectors in Australia.

        After the election, the Prime Minister said on the John Laws program, `I am desperate to be an honest man.' That is what he said: he is desperate to be an honest man.

They will think that he is a sneak, a welsher, a promise breaker, someone who made all those election promises for one purpose and one purpose only; that is, he made them to be broken. When he put his hand on his heart and said to the Australian people, `There will be no new taxes under a Howard administration,' he made that promise only to break it.

        One needs only to recall the debate in the House earlier. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) accurately described this tax as a mystery tax. So much for respect for the parliament ahead of the executive. The parliament does not even have an indication as to which items this tax will be levied on. There is one report in the media that 17,000 consumer items throughout Australia are to be affected by this legislation.

I can appreciate why the minister for industry was saying that it was a mystery ball, because his own delivery on this has bowled the Treasurer middle stump. He has rolled the Treasurer on this measure right through the cabinet process, and bowled him middle stump. He joins a long list of state and territory leaders who have been doing that in recent times. For the poor old Treasurer, it is duck after duck after duck as the middle stump is knocked back.

In that cricketing commercial the mystery ball starts out by going through the houses of Australia. It is very interesting to note that the mystery tax will be doing exactly the same thing. The mystery tax will be going through the houses—through the windows, through the doors—placing a three per cent consumption tax on all household items. It is a tax on baby walkers, battery operated dolls, bone china goods, can openers, candlesticks, coffee grinders, dolls' shoes, dolls' strollers, food blenders, microwave ovens, electric trains, food processors, knives, lint removers, men's and women's shavers, quilts, rice cookers, squeaky toys, toy music boxes, toy vehicles, toy washing machines, vacuum cleaners, video games and yoghurt makers.

We had at question time here today the rather bizarre notion constantly reinforced by both the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Treasurer that the $1,500 million worth of forced handovers or trade&amp;hyphen;offs coughed up last week by the state Premiers was not a new tax from the federal government, that it was not an impost from the federal government.

          There is another aspect of this legislation that I want to refer to briefly. One of the subsidiary items in the legislation is the restoration of agricultural use of diesel fuel in the mining of limestone to qualify for the diesel fuel rebate—something which we are quite supportive of. There is no problem there, but it does raise this issue of the diesel fuel rebate. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you represent a regional or rural electorate, as I do. You well understand that it is not just the farm sector which has received assurances about minimal change to the diesel fuel rebate. That is where they see themselves at the moment.

But, for heaven's sake, leave us with our untied grants.' That is how the Prime Minister explained it on the

The whole diesel fuel rebate issue exposes a lot about what is going on inside this government and helps us understand their lack of understanding about the task that faces them.

In recent days we saw the Treasurer lose another tax battle—his attempt to increase sales tax so far as the states are concerned.

        It can be seen as an increasing and growing agenda on the part of the government to encourage a debate on the introduction of a GST, leaving itself the space to introduce a GST in the course of this term or any other term that the Australian community might be unfortunate enough to be lumbered with.

        These items are strongly opposed by the opposition. The reason for that is succinctly found in the amendment proposed to be moved by the member for Hotham.

        If we look at the matters before this parliament at the moment, we find, in the industrial relations arena with the workplace relations bill, proposals that will directly adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers, particularly those in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania and, indirectly, throughout Australia through its attack on the three pillars of living standards of Australian workers—the Industrial Relations Commission, the award system and the right of workers to organise in their workplace. There you have one direct, immediate, adverse consequence for Australians in terms of their attempt to cash in on the rock solid guarantee that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave before the election—that no Australian worker would be worse off.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is very hard to convince the people I have met in workplaces, particularly those in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania, confronting these changes, that they will not be worse off. It is very hard to convince the more than 9,000 Australians in the Public Service who have lost their jobs that they are not worse off under this government. It is a very difficult argument to persuade those individuals, who thought they had a career and now find they are in search of a new career, that they are not worse off under this government. It is very hard to convince those people who will be paying the state taxes and charges flowing from that absolute debacle we had last week which went under the name of the Premiers Conference. It was nothing more than a debacle.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        State taxes and charges are flowing from that conference. I noticed the New South Wales Treasurer talking about the Howard and Costello tax that he was introducing, very reluctantly. With similar reluctance, the Premier of Queensland, the governments of Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and
        <break page="2120" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What we all know is that the taxes available to the states are inherently inequitable and regressive taxes. They do not have available to them the progressive taxes which are constitutionally the right and responsibility of this Commonwealth parliament. When you force the states to move in the direction of increasing their taxes and charges, the burden of that is principally going to fall on ordinary working men and women who are battling to earn an income and support their families. It is very hard to convince those people in those circumstances that they are not going to be worse off under this government—that after 100 days that rock solid guarantee is of much value to them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, the advocacy of this government is—and some states may respond in this direction if the press reports are correct—that they should not increase their taxes and charges; they should cut their services. All the evidence makes it very clear that the activity which government undertakes which does most to increase the equity in our society—that is the most effectively redistributive—is the way in which the government provides services, the expenditure of money raised on the provision of services. Services, by their very nature, predominantly go to Australians most in need—not everyone.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have to be rigorous in the review of expenditure and rigorous in our analysis of how revenue should be raised in terms of both efficiency and equity. Essentially, forcing the states to put up charges and to cut services is about making ordinary Australian men and women who depend upon those services to enhance their income, to provide opportunities for their children, health services for their families and support for their ageing parents suffer. Those are the things which are under threat.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When they are under threat those ordinary Australian workers do feel worse off. They do not feel that rock solid guarantee is giving them the security they felt they were guaranteed. All that occurs before we come to terms with this bill. Wages and conditions are under threat; jobs are under threat; state taxes and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         charges are forced up; services are cut; and the chance of people seeing opportunities for their children, such as getting into universities, is under threat. Against all that background, we now find a $100 million tax on consumer goods—a three per cent tax on consumer goods in blatant breach of the election.

        I did hear some very loyal backbench members of the government trying to say that this is not a tax. To the credit of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), he said, `It is unquestionably a tax on business.' So when it was proposed to abolish the tariff concession orders on business the minister for industry said it was a tax on business.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Now it is proposed to abolish the tariff on consumer items. It is very hard to argue that it is not a tax on consumers. The line of logic that would lead from the fact that it could be a tax on business to the fact that it is not a tax on consumers is a very tortured line of logic. If it is to be pursued it will be interesting to watch as a historical phenomenon in terms of tortured logic but not of any other contribution to the debate in this parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All we have to do is look at what are the criteria that any ordinary citizen might say constitutes a tax. They would say, `I went to buy this item and, as a consequence of a decision of the government, the item was more expensive than it might otherwise have been. I had to pay not only money to the person who provided me with the good but also something extra which went to the government. The combined effect of the payment to the provider of the good and the payment to the government made the good more expensive than it otherwise would have been.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Roughly, most people would say, `If that is the circumstance, we think we have been paying a tax.' It is money compulsorily paid to the government over and above the price of the good which you are receiving. By any reasonable measure, it is a tax. Consistent with the previous description by the minister for industry, it is a tax. So if it is a tax, how then does it not constitute a breach of that other promise about no new taxes, no increase
        <break page="2121" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         in existing taxes? If something wasn't the subject of any government revenue raising activity before this bill, it is the subject of government revenue raising after this bill.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Whether you want to call it a new tax or whether you want to call it an increase in the existing tax is an interesting semantic point of very little practical significance to the people who are paying the bill. One way or the other, if you have made a promise of no new taxes and no increase in existing taxes, you have broken one or half of one, depending upon how you define the extension of an existing tax to new goods.

       <para first-indent="16">
        More or less we have in that balance of items which affect the rock solid guarantee a very tried and true conservative government formula: you fight unemployment by sacking people and you fight inflation by putting prices up. I have never found either a very compelling argument. In combination they have never worked anywhere in the world, but that is what we have. We have a government saying its primary obligation is about jobs—

One is: how did their job creation over the last three years of their government compare to the job

          creation of ours? Did they create 700,000 jobs? The minister seems enthusiastic to be tested against that benchmark and we are very pleased to accommodate him.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I think on those three benchmarks they will be found wanting. But I do thank the minister for his proposal that I should add the third to the list because it is something which, over time, we will regard as important. There are other benchmarks on economic performance and performance of this government which we will put down in time and against which we will want to see the government measured.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Everybody in this place understands, or should understand, that governments need to raise revenue and that there is no popular way to do it. Increasing taxes is one way of increasing national savings to increase government revenue. There is no popular way to do it. No&amp;hyphen;one has ever been applauded for raising a tax, for raising a charge or for any other measure for increasing revenue. At least no&amp;hyphen;one has ever been applauded by the people who pay. You can sometimes get applauded by the people who do not have to pay if you impose the tax on someone else. I think there was a Queensland premier once upon a time who said the only good tax is a Commonwealth tax. There are many taxpayers who would say the only good tax is one somebody else has to pay. But revenue is important and this is about raising revenue.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition's quibble is not with the fact that the government has an obligation to raise revenue. After all, we made similar proposals which we would have implemented if elected. Our concern is that this is a revenue measure, a significant part of which this government promised it would not take. So this is, unequivocally, a broken promise.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Having spoken for the former government for three years in the Senate, often on tax and revenue matters, this government when in opposition almost inevitably took the soft option on every occasion. We are saying we will support those parts which went to the people. We work on the starting point presumption, which will not apply on every occasion, that a government is entitled to raise its revenue as it chooses and be tested by the public at the election as to the manner in which it has gone about doing it. That is a fair starting point presumption. Sometimes the taxes proposed and charges and revenue measures are so unfair that one has to qualify that position, and we will reserve the right to do that. On some other occasions, they are so fundamentally, flagrantly in breach of election promises that you cannot support them and you certainly feel free from that general starting point presumption. This is certainly just such a case—`No new taxes; no increases in existing taxes.'

       <para first-indent="16">
        Yet we have this very long list of goods, which is the best list that the opposition can come up with because the government is trying to keep hidden its list of consumer goods that are going to be taxed—thousands and thousands of goods, many of which are bought regularly by ordinary Australians for their children and for themselves for the conduct of their household and their family recreational activities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They were not taxed before. They are not taxed now. It will make them worse off. They are worse off after the decision than they were before the decision. It is very hard to

         explain to the working men and women of Australia how that conforms with the contention that no worker will be worse off under a Howard government. Today they do not have to pay tax on these goods. If this bill passes they will have to do so.

         —Tonight's debate in terms of the Labor Party's response to the government's customs legislation has been quite amazing. There has been one line, and the rest of the speakers have clearly trotted it out. While I thank them for their contribution, it has been a bit hard to warm up to it because there was really not much in it. When we look at the history of this, we find that

The reason for it was that someone had been looking at the Treasury figures and knew, as everybody else did, that those opposite were telling lies again. They knew as well as anybody else that the budget deficit was much worse than they were letting on. The former spokesman on finance said he did not know the figures but he was sure they were right. But Keating knew better. He had this new tax. He wanted to take away the concession and so forth, put five per cent on to business and completely eliminate the policy by-law.

        Having inherited this problem from the Labor Party after the election, we then found a very considerable reaction from the business community to another five per cent tax on inputs. There was to be a reduction and an add-on to costs. That is what you did for them. Needless to say, the business community had a few words to the government about the inequity of this new position they were in. With our being a reasonable government, we met with various interested business groups and discussed with them the impact of the proposed Labor tax.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In response to that, we met with people across the board and we discussed how much it would have cost business in this area. It would have cost them an enormous amount of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         money, and I am not surprised they were upset. Individual companies would be forced to bear additional costs—between $10 million and $25 million per firm. So quite naturally we had a look at what was going on.

        When they pointed out the implications of how this tax fell, we also found the enormous administrative problem that came with it. At no time in the hustle and bustle of the campaign did you bother to define what a business input was. You wanted to cover up the black hole. You had to get some money in after the election, so you did not define what a business input was and you did not define what a consumer good was. You just announced a broad decision.

       <para first-indent="16">
        When we looked at the administration of this tax, we found that the only way you could bring in the level of business inputs was to spread it across certain areas—not to consumers. As a consequence of that, we found it was necessary to look at how this new tax would be fitted. As a result of consultations with industry, the government introduced a measure which would effectively reduce the government's proposed area by 40 per cent.

        Tonight people over there have been jumping up and down about consumer goods. I invite them to look at what this really means. The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), during the debate, alluded to the fact that gym equipment would come under one of the special areas. There are numerous areas which have difficulties—not only mobile telephones, television sets or the various other items that no doubt you would call consumer items. If these items are used within a business context, then they are outside the game. How are you going to define in terms of administrative simplicity a television set that is brought in and used within a motel or taken home for use or something like that? As a consequence,

        The other aspect of the opposition's miscalculation—obviously done in haste during the election campaign, sent by the former Prime Minister down to the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) to give it the white stamp—was based on the assumption there would be a split of 70:30. The advice that I have is that the split between business inputs and consumer items is closer to 80:20. There is a huge difference between personal consumption and business inputs. The effect of this would be a difference in revenue of the order of $200 million.

As a consequence of that, the proposals put forward by the opposition are really quite poor.

In fact, it is carrying out an informal price monitoring. It is yet to be determined whether it will issue a report. The difference is that it is an informal, not a formal, monitoring.

        The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1995, Act No. 87 of 1995, the CELA Act.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The CELA Act made substantial amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 relating to the diesel fuel rebate scheme, to tighten the eligibility criteria for rebates of customs and excise duty paid on purchases of diesel fuel.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the course of the Senate debate on the CELA Act on 29 and 30 June 1995, 80 amendments were successfully moved to the CELA bill as introduced. In the course of translating those amendments into a final royal assent bill, several substantive problems with the commencement and the application and savings provisions were created which
        <break page="2129" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         were acknowledged as contrary to the expressed intention of the Senate.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The application and savings provisions problems arose because modifications were not made to these provisions to take account of amendments made by the then opposition and Greens, in particular relating to the law as it applied to quarrying and sand mining prior to 1 July 1995. Also, consequential amendments were not made to the commencement provisions even though it was agreed that particular amendments would commence at particular times. Several minor transcription errors in the CELA Act were also identified.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On 29 August 1995, the then government introduced the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 into the Senate. The purpose of that bill was to amend the CELA Act to correct the transcription errors and the problems with the commencement and the application and savings provisions. However, the bill lapsed upon the prorogation of parliament on 29 January 1996.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With the exception of one proposed addition which I will discuss shortly, this bill is in substantially the same form as the 29 August 1995 bill and is being pursued because the need to correct the problems with the application provisions and restore the Senate's intention still exists, particularly in relation to the law applicable to mining for minerals. The CELA Act amended the definition of minerals by excluding certain materials, with effect from 1 July 1995 only. Any existing rebate applications or any matters before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the courts that relate to the use of diesel fuel in mining operations prior to 1 July 1995 were intended to be decided in accordance with the law as it existed prior to 1 July 1995.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The CELA Act as passed did not give effect to this intention and without the corrections to the CELA Act proposed in this bill, these applications will be governed by the amended law. The principal effect of the bill is to allow those companies which had lodged applications before 1 July 1995 to have them considered on the basis of the law as it existed prior to 1 July 1995, thereby restoring the original intention of the CELA Act.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Passage of this bill will make those essential technical amendments.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill as introduced into the other chamber on 6 May proposed to make one minor addition to the CELA Act to restore diesel fuel rebate eligibility for the extraction of limestone for use in the de&amp;hyphen;acidification of soil in agriculture, post 1 July 1995. The government's proposal picked up the recommendation of the then opposition senators and the Australian Democrats in October and November of last year concerning this important landcare activity. The result of the restoration of this diesel fuel rebate eligibility would have been to ensure that the cost of lime to farmers would not increase.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        During the committee stage of the bill in the Senate, amendments were moved by the WA Greens to remove the items of the bill which proposed to restore this category of rebate eligibility. The Senate agreed to these amendments. The Senate also agreed to amendments moved by the WA Greens to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This amendment inserted new section 75E into that act to provide for the payment of a cash rebate in respect of activities undertaken to prevent land degradation in years when deductions cannot be made from income due to lack of assessable income.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government did not support these amendments at the time, and remains of that view now. I foreshadow that the government will be moving amendments during the committee stage of this bill to reverse the Senate's amendments, and effectively restore the bill to its terms as originally introduced into the Senate on 6 May.
       </para>

        The government is proceeding in this way because it is convinced that the limestone amendment it proposed was appropriate and consistent with the other types of diesel fuel rebate eligibility. It costed the proposal and considers it capable of being controlled through the audit mechanisms which accompany the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The same cannot be said, however, of the Income Tax Assessment Act amendment for the payment of cash rebates for landcare activities which replaced the government's proposal in the other place.

         The government is advised by the Australian Taxation Office that the Income Tax Assessment Act amendment could cost around $7 million per annum. It is also important to note that the proposed amendment could distort a taxpayer's choice of the most appropriate mix of landcare activities to undertake. The amendment would allow those entitled to the cash rebate a greater benefit—100 per cent of expenditure—than primary producers who are currently claiming deductions under the Income Tax Assessment Act and who receive a tax benefit based only on their marginal tax rate.

Similarly, the Commonwealth directs significant outlays into the national landcare program.

        The first 1995 amendment bill introduced by the Labor government implemented changes that we had proposed to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. In effect, the purpose of those changes was to tighten the eligibility criteria under the scheme. That became necessary due to extensions of eligibility over years through litigation and because of the refined definitions of agricultural and mining operations. As a consequence, we inserted a specific list of eligible activities into the legislation. It removed the eligibility for `residential purposes' and it narrowed the definition of minerals to exclude the eligibility for the extraction of certain substances because their extraction was not considered to be mining.

It should have been operational over six months ago. That would have happened but for the interference by the then opposition—the now government, which is bringing it back in—and the minor parties in the Senate.

        This was originally, as it should be now, just a correctional bill. However, the opposition and minor parties in the Senate used the opportunity to raise substantive issues of eligibility under the scheme, despite the obvious technical emphasis of the bill. For example, they sought to have the diesel fuel rebate for limestone extraction reinstated. We had removed this in the first 1995 amendment bill.

        The government's new bill before the House now, as it was introduced into the Senate, did contain one difference to our original bill. It sought to reintroduce eligibility under the scheme for limestone extraction—but for agricultural use only, that is, the extraction of limestone for use in the de&amp;hyphen;acidification of soil in agriculture. Obviously, this resulted from backbench pressure in the coalition ranks. It will have the effect of adding an additional $620,000 per financial year to Commonwealth outlays.

        We took the view that the limestone extraction, for whatever purpose, should be excluded from eligibility under the scheme with effect from 1 July of last year. Essentially, we took the view that limestone extraction was quarrying and not mining. I think that on any sensible reading of the definition that is a legitimate position to take. Given that the rebate under the act is available under the scheme only for mining operations, we thought it appropriate to exclude it.

We will support the government's bill with those amendments. We do so because, apart from the limestone provision, the bill will give effect to our 1995 changes. Those changes were important and necessary to ensure that the scheme was more effectively targeted at those the government intended to benefit from it, not others who were able to argue expanded interpretation of eligibility criteria through the courts—a very expensive process in terms of the litigation as well as the impact on outlays.

        It is interesting that the government is now supporting the passage of legislation to which it was vigorously opposed last year. It is also interesting that it has picked up only one of the concerns that led it to take that position in the Senate. Those concerns were raised by a number of the government backbench. They identified three areas of concern, and a number of newspaper reports have indicated that some are prepared to cross the floor if the government is not prepared to accede to the three of them. In fact, the government has indicated acceptance of only one of them. It will be interesting to see in this debate how some of those earlier critics respond to the other two areas of change that they proposed but which the government is not, in this legislation, seeking to pick up.

Farmers in her area, which has seen a huge growth in agricultural output and value added products, will suffer. They know the importance of living on the margin. They understand fundamentally what impact any cuts to this scheme will have on them.

          What the government are seeking to do by this bill is worthy. Essentially, it does what we wanted to do but what they opposed. I did want to take the opportunity in this debate to draw to the attention of the House that there is no point correcting the scheme by way of tightening it and making it more efficient if your hidden agenda is just to emasculate the scheme. There is no point pretending that you are into efficiency and making sure that only the right ones get it if you are then going to strip away the very means, resources and entitlement that many have so often relied upon in the past.

        This government was voted into power largely on the rural people's concern and great distress about the way the previous government's business costs rose over the last 13 years so that business found it very difficult to compete internationally. Over the last 13 years there were rising rates of rural youth suicide. In fact, over the last five years those rates of rural youth suicide have doubled. So, far from the previous government enjoying a sense of enormous fellowship and joy when it came to the rural sector, if those in opposition got out there they would find that the rural sector is now enjoying the fact that there is a government that appreciates the costs of doing business and is doing all it can to assist primary industries and mining to be world competitive.

        This amendment is all about making sure that farmers can afford to apply lime as an agricultural additive to their land. We have an incredible history in Australia of managing to produce, in particular, crops and pasture from country which is largely not terribly fertile, especially when compared with our competitors in Europe or the USA.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Up to the turn of the century and a little beyond, farmers were trying very hard to compete on international markets, but with very low productivity levels. They tried, therefore, to clear more land to produce crops over a number of years—until the invention of superphosphate. Superphosphate was a miracle for these croppers and pastoralists. When they worked out their equipment so they could spread the superphosphate along with the seed, they found their productivity
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         increasing 10 per cent and more per annum for a number of years.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It meant that we produced a surplus of good quality grain, for example, that helped us to establish ourselves on the international markets as a reliable supplier of high quality cereal. Superphosphate meant that we could start to increase our dairy production to a point where we went well beyond our domestic needs. Again, we could start to develop our processing sector and put our processed product onto international markets.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So superphosphate was a miracle substance. It was not all that expensive because the governments of the day supported farmers by providing subsidies for applying that material. It was used in such a way that some of it entered into the watertables and the nutrient levels went up there and then it flowed into our streams. But that was not the biggest problem. Over a number of years, despite the ongoing application of the superphosphate, it was noticed that fertility levels were again declining. We discovered that we had what we now call soil acidification—a result of long-term use of superphosphate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As with all things affecting Australia, we take problems in agriculture very seriously. After a period of research it was found that one of the most successful ways to overcome soil acidity was the application of agricultural lime, or calcium carbonate. The trouble with calcium carbonate is that you have to use it in fairly heavy doses—something like four tonnes per hectare—you need to use it over a number of years because it takes a fair time to be watered and absorbed into the soil process, and it costs about $50 per tonne.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I said, you have to repeat the applications for quite a number of years. Soil fertility does not very rapidly improve but it does over time. Improvement is steady. To ask a farmer who is presently experiencing a downturn in trade to put something worth $50 per tonne onto his property is a big ask.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Because it supports those who are mining the lime product and because they are then able to pass on the saving to the primary producer, this diesel fuel rebate is a very substantial measure assisting the primary producer to restore fertility to the country. It
        <break page="2137" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         also means that over time the effects of superphosphate are less detrimental. As has been said, superphosphates can end up in our streams, leading to blue&amp;hyphen;green algae outbreaks and the other results of nutrient laden waters getting into our major waterways. Fortunately also, the lime can be quarried throughout large areas of the country with fairly low technology.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The amendment to this bill gives us the ability to put back into the system access to calcium carbonate, or agricultural lime, which we believe will be of enormous benefit. In my electorate we produce something like $1.5 billion worth of export product. That product comes from agricultural land all of which over many years has used superphosphate. We also grow cereals. The cost of the diesel rebate for one year—which, as the previous speaker referred to, is something in the order of $2 billion—is not much more than the value of the export production of my electorate. When we look at it in those terms, the value of this diesel rebate overall is an extraordinarily good investment in our agricultural output.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Lime is a natural substance—it is calcium carbonate. When we export products with a clean, green label we are in no way interfering with the concept that our primary production is without chemicals or artificial additives that could be seen to be detrimental, particularly to our Asian food markets. Furthermore, the diesel fuel rebate in no way could be challenged as being GATT inconsistent. It is not a subsidy; we are simply not applying an excise.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So in every way you care to look at this particular amendment, as our previous speaker said, there is a very important outcome. It is an amendment that all of us in this House could readily agree to. It is of great benefit to the environment because agriculture can be sustained as long as we maintain fertility and overcome the major problem of soil acidity.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Our primary producers often have to compete against corrupt markets, in the sense of having to compete against subsidised product. Costs of production in Australia are extraordinarily high. Our farmers need all the help they can get. In my electorate, the dairy
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         farmers are competing against New Zealand to earn the title of the world's most cost efficient dairy producers. The availability of agricultural lime is of enormous value and benefit, so I very strongly support the previous speaker and, of course, my government in endorsing this amendment which will make agricultural lime a part of the diesel rebate scheme.

        Having put those two positions in place, let me comment on some of the `pontificating' of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) in lecturing us on breaking promises—breaking promises, and then starting to talk about fuel tax! I have a reasonably long memory. I reckon that I went around Australia telling people that we had a tax proposal in Fightback that would remove fuel tax but impose a 15 per cent GST. I can remember the member for Hotham, joining with his then Prime Minister and others, saying, `We can do all of that; we can give you personal tax cuts, we can give you everything you want, and we don't intend to raise any taxes at all.' What was the result of that on their re-election? They put 6c a litre on the price of fuel.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, when I was putting this proposition around Australia, I painted a little picture. The picture was of the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, being kidnapped by the KGB as a child and taken over to Russia for the purpose of being brainwashed and sent back to Australia to become a politician and wreck the Australian economy. I was able to point out that, as time went by, the trip was proved not to be necessary. The reality of it all was that, when they gave him his book of instructions to come back to Australia, on the front page they would have written in thick black texta `tax transport'. Why? Because Australia is just so dependent on it.

         The previous speaker, the member for Murray (Mrs Stone), was at pains to point out the huge cost of transporting limestone, a product that has almost no value at all as it sits in a quarry somewhere. It is worth  only a few dollars a tonne. By the time it is delivered to the property that needs it the freight cost can be 10 times the value of the product in the back of the truck. That freight cost is directly proportionate to the amount of tax we apply to distillate. When the then Keating government, the opposition as it is now, added 6c a litre to the cost of fuel, the effects flowed through the entire economy. It put up the cost of groceries in the supermarket; it put up everybody's operating costs.

         I welcome the fact that we have this legislation before us today. This is legislation which originally was aimed at making sure that certain areas of operation liable for fuel excise tax but avoiding it be brought to account. The original legislation, which was passed by the previous government, prevented some loopholes which a former tax avoidance industry was trying to establish. But here we are today making sure that such an essential product as lime, so ably referred to by the previous speaker, will not carry the burden of a fuel tax of 36c a litre—and that is up, as I recollect, from 6c a litre when we lost office back in 1983.

         Nevertheless, having said that, we recognise the hypocrisy of these statements—this hand wringing, `Keep your promises.' John Dawkins, the poor old Treasurer who had to implement this thing, left the parliament because he was so ashamed. He had to go before the people and promise a tax regime like `l-a-w and no additional taxes' and then had to present his first and only budget which broke all those promises. So we do not want to hear any more about broken promises from the other side; it is just embarrassing. The reality is that we on this side have to keep our promises, and there is nothing more important to consider than the diesel rebate scheme.

         I have been around this parliament long enough to remember its history. In fact, when I first entered the parliament we had a very simple system of tax exemption for all off&amp;hyphen;road use of distillate. It was as simple as that.
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          The entitlement was established by the issuing of a number which was quoted on purchase and which in fact applies today in the sales tax system. However—and I do admit it to be true—certain fuel agents, having obtained the number of a particular eligible client, maybe a farmer, started filling up trucks of other ineligible operators and then simply writing in the number that applied to one of their eligible clients.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It was Doug Anthony who, having had this drawn to his attention by the department, introduced the current rebate system. To that point, off&amp;hyphen;road distillate attracted no tax. It was not a revenue item; it was not an expenditure item. It just did not exist. I corresponded with Doug at the time, saying I thought there were other administrative alternatives. I argued for a plastic card which could be held at the point of delivery and franked onto the delivery documentation to establish the exemption right of people. It would not be available back at the depot to be used for some truckie. I thought that was administratively better.

        <para first-indent="16">
         But suddenly, 10, 12 or 15 years later, from the moment we established the rebate scheme, which simply said that everybody pays the tax and those eligible get a rebate, we created a revenue item and an expenditure item. Of course, the expenditure item is now referred to by the bureaucracy as an outlay of government. It was never money to which we were entitled; it was never money that we took. We did it for administrative reasons. I felt it was a very complex and unnecessary system. But the bureaucrats knew where they were heading.

         I express my concern that in defence of the sorts of cuts that they should take in terms of their administration of our nation, they are saying, `There are other ways.' I do not doubt for a minute that they are coming to my senior colleagues and saying, `You don't need to take my job away, mate. We've got this expenditure item of $1.2 billion and you're committed to cutting expenditure. It's not a tax. The fact that you add 36c a litre to the operating expenses of farmers, fishermen or miners—don't you worry about that. My job

         I have got to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, my view is this: it is not an expenditure cut, if such a decision were taken. I am confident that we will stand by that promise, but if it were taken—and this is a message to the bureaucracy who I know promote these sorts of ideas—it would have a substantial effect on various sectors of our business community. It is the worst form of tax. As I said, it would have been the first one which the KGB would recommend for increase in the context of Australia, with its diversified and distant resource developments, spread all over the place.

         It is a huge cost. It must be recognised for what it is. I think the case has been put for farmers. They have a huge cost in cropping today. To be efficient within world markets, they use extremely large equipment. They no longer use horses; they no longer use little equipment. Manpower has been replaced by huge horsepower and large fuel consumption. They should not have to pay that when everything they sell is subject to international competition—often corrupted international competition.

         Let us quickly move to the fishing industry. I have a constituent who sends three trawlers from the town of Geraldton to the Gulf of Carpentaria every year. The cheque he writes to fuel up those three trawlers, to get them there to fish for a week or so, is $600,000. If you were to add the 36c a litre to which the opposition raised the diesel fuel tax, you would then see his outlay go to $1.2 million, in order to position his boats and get them fishing for a product. Once, you could sell prawns or shrimps anywhere in the world. Today, there is huge competition from fish farming in Asia. They are no longer in a market where you name the price and someone takes the product. They are now in a market where there is intense price competition and they are only hanging in there by marketing their product as being fresh and from the sea, instead of raised in a mud hole.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We then move to mining. Mining has been transformed. The fundamentals of mining today are no longer burrowing through the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          earth in narrow tunnels and finding the very high&amp;hyphen;grade ores. We have gone back into all of those old workings; today we open&amp;hyphen;cut them. That is achieved by shifting huge volumes of earth at very low percentage mineralisation. We have new technology that deals with that.

         Whereas the use of diesel fuel was minimal in many mining establishments, today it is one of their principal costs because they are shifting all this dirt—huge quantities. Everything is running around on rubber tyres. I was told the other day—and I will stand corrected if I am wrong—that the major fuel agent in Kalgoorlie now distributes more distillate than is consumed in the whole state of Victoria. I would not be surprised. It is massive—low grade, big volumes and very profitable for the nation. We see it in the massive rise in gold production and exports, paying off that international debt.

         When one talks about minerals, the most commonly heard phrase that is greatly misunderstood in the community is `recoverable reserves'. Recoverable reserves are not what someone has established as being the mineral in the ground. It is the amount of mineral you can get out at present day prices and present day costs at a profit. The minute, for instance, someone was to impose that fuel excise tax on the mining industry, every mine in Australia would have to downgrade their recoverable reserves. Salomon Brothers would be on the phone possibly downgrading Australia's credit rating because our assets had been diminished. Those that have a prospectus in the marketplace to start up a new mining venture would have to recall it and rewrite that component. Investors would, in many cases, see that. Every mine in Australia would have its life reduced by the imposition of that tax. These are the reasons why I know we are not going to do it. We have made a promise and we will keep it. Furthermore, it has got to be understood what a negative situation it would be.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There is an argument of simple arithmetic. If you add 36c a litre, which would be a doubling in normal terms of the fuel cost of any business venture, and particularly mining, it is obviously going to have an effect on the
         <break page="2140" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          bottom line—the taxable profit. So the first thing government would forgo would be the 30c in the dollar company tax. Add to that whatever other rationalisation they attempted to achieve by sacking workers and everything and you would lose some PAYE tax. You would be lucky to recover 50c in the dollar anyway. These are the figures that bureaucrats do not always provide when they come up with these smart ideas.

         I stand by our policy. Our policy was that we would not impose or change the arrangements of the diesel fuel rebate. It should not be changed for farmers, fishermen, foresters and miners. We show our credentials in this legislation by making sure that, although it might be perceived as an industry where you mine limestone for the purposes of building blocks, household construction or the creation of cement, there is a component that goes in very large quantities to rural activity. It is ridiculous to add to that cost.

         The member for Murray went so far as to point out the huge quantities required. When you are talking about 5,000 acres of land and three or four tonnes to the acre, an extra dollar a tonne is huge money. That is the sort of cost that people in my electorate are confronted with. They also do that with other sites of minerals of that nature. It is an environmentally good practice. It should never be forgotten that, when you apply these sorts of minerals and regenerate soil and its productivity, the soil is not deteriorating; it is not being abandoned. It is as positive a move as you can make.

         The other product I was thinking of in that regard—it is now getting huge usage in my electorate—is gypsum.

How stupid can you get? That is the greatest description I can give. I will forgive them some of their fibs and their broken promises, but do not come to this place being stupid. The question that should be coming from you people—I say this with respect—is, `Where can we get together on some of these important issues?' Where is the middle ground?

We should give them, firstly, the right and, secondly, the responsibility to raise some money in their own right and be answerable. You could do the same with local government.

If you went for a GST and wanted to impose it at 11c and we wanted it imposed at 12c, I am quite relaxed about that. That is the sort of thing that you can argue in an election. But it is about time some of the fundamentals were addressed. The reality is that if we did it people might remember us and put our position somewhere above that of a second&amp;hyphen;hand car salesman.

        The annual additional cost of restoring the diesel fuel rebate eligibility for the extraction of limestone is about $620,000, which, in terms of lost revenue, is negligible when compared with the substantial benefits that would flow from increased agricultural production after the introduction of limestone to reduce soil acidity. I notice that the honourable member for Page (Mr Causley) is in the House at the moment. He was once the minister for agriculture in New South Wales. He would well know the value of adding lime to soil. It is imperative that the government provide incentives to the limestone quarrying industry to extract limestone as economically as possible in order to make its use economically viable and to encourage farmers to use the product in greater quantities as a remedial strategy in the fight against acidity.

        The total area of acid soils in Australia, defined as soils with a pH of less than 4.8, is about 29 million hectares, of which some 24 million hectares are used for agriculture. New South Wales, with about 9.5 million hectares of acid soils, is most affected, followed by Victoria—and I notice the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) had a lot to say about this—Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. These statistics are a stark indication of the full extent of the soil acidity problem and the ongoing need for it to be addressed by the introduction of limestone to the farming cycle.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Accurate diagnosis of acid soil infertility, coupled with sound advice on the need for lime and other fertilisers, is critical if farmers are to obtain the productivity gains needed to offset their costs. Using lime to raise the pH in our fine soils to a pH of around six is essential for optimum plant growth and an important tool in countering the negative impact of acid soils on future farm productivity and profitability.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The process of acidification is a natural one with soils tending to become more acid over a period of time. Australian farmers have
        <break page="2142" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         started with fairly acid soils and, in a bid for higher productivity through the use of nitrogen fixing legumes and nitrogenous fertilisers, farming practices have hastened this process.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Farmers with a soil acidity problem basically have two choices to maintain productivity. The choice is between having a fairly high productive system and taking lime as an extra cost or taking a low intensive, low yielding system and using no lime, but their income will be reduced because of this. Farmers wanting to maintain the productivity of their land must use lime. The higher the system in terms of yields and inputs, the more lime is needed to maintain an adequate pH level. Lucerne growers, for example, have to look at liming as part of their regular costs because irrigation and high productivity tend to acidify the soil extremely quickly. The higher the returns the more it will pay to lime.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the major problems with soil acidification is that the more the pH is allowed to drop the higher the cost will be to rectify the problem. If the problem is allowed to develop to the extent that the subsoil is affected, there is no solution. Once the subsoil goes acid, only the most acid tolerant plants such as oats and sub&amp;hyphen;clovers can be grown. Acidification of the subsoil is a form of permanent degradation, leaving a massive problem not only for today's farmers but also for future farmers and the environment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The big danger is that if farmers with soil acidity and aluminium or manganese problems do not start to use lime the soil will continue to acidify, which means that they will have to put on more lime and it will cost more money to increase the pH level. Soil acidity is an increasingly serious problem affecting a large part of the south&amp;hyphen;west slopes of New South Wales, parts of which are in my electorate of Riverina.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In response to this problem the New South Wales Department of Mineral Resources has been actively undertaking a campaign aimed at identifying and assessing potential sources of agricultural limestone in the southern part of the state. This campaign has been in recognition of the need to develop new sources close to areas affected by acidity in order to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         substantially reduce the cost to farmers because of the lower transport cost component, and thereby encouraging greater use of limestone.

        In addition to boosting sustainable agricultural productivity, winning the fight against increasing soil acidity has important ramifications for the environment. Poorer plant growth due to acid soils means less ground cover and the result is increased soil erosion which seriously damages the environment. Combating soil degradation is vital and is an important element of the coalition government's commitment to integrating the joint interests of sustainable development, especially in primary industries, and environmental protection.

        The government, by restoring the diesel fuel rebate eligibility for limestone quarrying operations, has recognised the importance of the mining industry's contribution to the Australian economy. This contribution must be at the forefront of any debate on the future of the diesel fuel rebate and its application to the broader mining industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It must be emphasised the diesel fuel rebate scheme is not a subsidy—and we have already heard the member for O'Connor make that statement. It is a legitimate recognition of the fact that the mining and agricultural industries operate in remote areas, off&amp;hyphen;road, and is an exemption from an Australian duty to ensure our exporters compete on a level playing field.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Australian miners typically pay 27 or 28c per litre for diesel. This would increase to about 58c per litre if the rebate were abolished. The mining industry's competitors in countries like Indonesia or Chile pay only 20 or 24c per litre.

         Both the mining and agricultural industries are the mainstay of the Australian economy and their export capabilities and earning power must be protected in the national interest. In many cases, the mining industry is a price taker and not a price maker, so any new cost imposts simply reduce the industry's global competitiveness and the end result is a detrimental impact on the Australian economy.

         A case in point is the Normandy group, one of Australia's largest miners and its biggest gold miner, producing from its mines nearly 20 per cent of the nation's gold production. This company also employs about 5,000 people. The group's mines consume some 100 million litres of diesel fuel per annum and removal of the current exemption from diesel fuel excise would result in an additional direct cost of $30 million per annum. Nearly 100 per cent of mineral production is exported into markets where the price is dictated by global market forces and the seller is unable to pass on cost increases.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It must never be forgotten that the mining industry is the single most important industry contributor to the Australian economy, representing nearly 40 per cent of Australia's total exports and operating in a world market where there are no safety nets. In 1993-94, in current price terms, mining gross product totalled $16.5 billion or 3.9 per cent of total GDP. This compares with 3.1 per cent in the rural sector, including farming, forestry and fishing; 14.5 per cent in manufacturing; and 78.5 per cent for all other industries. The removal of the diesel fuel rebate scheme as it applies to the mining industry would result in a cost impost of $700 million.

          Because of the importance of resources to Australia's export trade, policies or actions which damage the international competitiveness of Australia's resource sector can have serious adverse implications for Australia's balance of payments. Increased costs mean higher cut-off grades and, as a result, minerals which at current fuel costs are economic to mine will become uneconomic and the impact will be disastrous in terms of closures of marginal mines, especially those small to medium sized mines which are already suffer ing under different policies of the previous government which we will have to overcome. Job losses will emanate from that, including the impact of a mining employment multiplier of over four to one, reduced export revenue, lower company profits depressing the share market and a reduction in government revenues via corporate and personal income taxes.

         As I have already stated, almost 100 per cent of mine production is exported. In 1994-95 minerals and energy exports totalled $29.8 billion, representing 50 per cent of merchandise exports—goods only—and 40 per cent of total exports in goods and services. The strong performance of the minerals industry has had important positive implications for regional economies, such as direct employment and the establishment of supporting industries such as geophysical analysis and exploration services. It has also had positive implications for power generation, steel production, ports, shipping and transport services.

These statistics serve to graphically highlight the mining industry's significant contribution to the national economy and bring into sharp focus the need for government to pursue policies which protect the viability and future of Australia's largest exporter.

I certainly support the maintenance of the diesel fuel rebate for limestone quarrying operations.

I therefore take great pleasure in having the opportunity to talk on the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) as this topic will have strong ramifications to Australia's economic wellbeing, pending the final outcomes.

The wealth producing sector of Australia is sick and tired of successive governments whittling away their hard won gains in productivity. It is virtually impossible to win a game where the goalposts and the rules consistently change against them. We cannot afford for that to happen. The mining sector and the farming sector provide the largest percentage of our export earnings. Reduce this and we will continue to have a serious economic problem in this country for a long time to come.

        There are a considerable number of mining industries operating in my electorate of Capricornia covering such sectors as coal, gold, minerals and gemstones.

         —Today is a historic occasion in the history of Australian industrial relations. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill put forward by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and strongly supported by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) represents a shift from the 100&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old culture of centralised wage fixing and addresses Australia's arthritic labour market structures, dominated by unions and arbitral tribunals resembling the craft based guilds of medieval England.

        This is the backdrop to the debate on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill.

        This sea change had its early beginnings in the backbench committee of the coalition opposition in 1986. In this context, I place on the public record the great contribution to the public debate by the honourable member for Barker, the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan). Events like the Dollar Sweets case, Robe River and the landmark Mudginberri dispute drew attention to the reality that unbridled union power was alive and well. But there were other positive forces, such as the member for Barker and his ally Paul Houlihan, Peter Costello, the Treasurer, and Charles Copeman, who sought to find a better industrial relations system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The backbench industrial relations committee, which I had the honour of chairing during these early debates, developed the early proposals for enterprise bargaining. For his part, John Howard lent his formidable talents to arguing and supporting the case. He has remained one of the strongest advocates for change to the system on the Australian political scene. The ongoing debate was ably assisted by the former shadow minister, the Hon. Neil Brown QC, and the current Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). In the end, the Hawke government changed its longstanding opposition to enterprise bargaining, albeit a little too late.

        Today I feel personally very proud that those strenuous and hard&amp;hyphen;fought debates have finally found a more complete manifestation. Big business leaders said it could never be done, living as they did in a cosy system where all workers were paid according to the award no matter what their attitudes, skills and capacities. Today, in 1996, the system of industrial relations remains highly centralised, heavily regulated and dominated by the `Industrial relations club', first talked about by Gerard Henderson in his 1983

         Awards remain complex and detailed, leaving little scope for enterprises to agree on specific terms and conditions of employment. Enterprise agreements must be approved by the IRC and can be rejected even when a consensus of employees supports the agreement. Union structure is tightly regulated, giving large established unions monopoly rights over workers due to the `conveniently belong' rule. The monopoly position of the union movement is entrenched by preference clauses, which are still prescribed in several awards, giving union members preference in employment over non&amp;hyphen;union workers. Laws on unfair dismissals are prescriptive and technical, providing a strong disincentive to small employers to hire new staff.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This centralised and regulated industrial relations system had its advent in the 1907 Harvester judgment delivered by Justice Higgins. It was then that the foundations were laid for the system which has handicapped Australia's economic development for the last 100 years. The background to this case was that a tariff of £12 was charged on imported harvesters and a tax of £6 was charged on Australian produced harvesters. Manufacturers were exempt from the tax if they paid wages which were deemed to be fair and reasonable. So Justice Higgins set about to determine whether the wages paid by one particular manufacturer were fair and reasonable, thus ascertaining whether the company was eligible to have an exemption from the excise.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Rather than relying on the company's capacity to pay or on the productivity of individual employees, Higgins decided wage levels could be determined only on the basis of a crude estimate of the cost of living. There was no suggestion that the price of labour be determined by the realities of supply and demand, as in the case of groceries at the supermarket. Instead, His Honour took expert testimony from a number of housewives on the cost of a number of goods. In the compilation of those goods, His Honour took into account a number of items that were considered to make up the basic wage for the case. In compiling that list, the items added up to the cost of living that was taken
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          into account in drafting his famous Harvester proposal.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Having the Harvester proposal and the tariff regime surrounding that proposal in place meant that from 1907 to 1996 Australian industrial relations were dominated by the feature of a non-market arrangement. So industrial tribunals came down with awards and had arrangements that had no relationship to the marketplace. These awards were prescriptive and had no relationship to the way in which Australians worked in the factories and on the farms.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So the manufacturers were able to live in this protected environment, which meant that the exporters, the farmers and the miners had to compete on the world markets. On the one hand, the farmers were receiving the price for their wool and their grain as the world market might decree. However, other people in the manufacturing area were receiving a price that was largely determined by the cost of labour which, in turn, was arbitrated by the Arbitration Commission.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This process went on and on and on. People in Australia considered that this was the normal order of things, so much so that, until there was a challenge to the award system by the likes of the Minister for Industrial Relations, who is at the table, Ian McLachlan and others, people in Australia thought that there could never be a change to the position that the Harvester award had created—a basic wage for all Australians. From that point on, the changes would take a long while to be introduced.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So big manufacturing companies maintained this ancient system that had no relativity to the genuine marketplace of the productivity and capacities of individual Australians. This wage fixing system developed in those early years by the Harvester judgment led to the H.R. Nicholls Society being formed in the early 1980s.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That society developed a questioning attitude to the current arrangements of Australian industrial relations. The activities of that group challenged the status quo of industrial relations in Australia. I pay tribute to that group. It developed some arguments that were followed up in this parliament and argued in
         <break page="2149" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          many forums around Australia. I pay tribute to the minister at the table for having reached this landmark decision.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also pay tribute to the arguments put by a former member of this House, the Hon. Bert Kelly. He had long debates about the tariffs that were related to the Harvester judgment and about the fact that certain industries enjoyed this protection whereas their workers were protected at a level of wages and salaries that had no relativity to the outside marketplace, let alone the Australian marketplace.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The key objectives of the bill are to promote cooperation in the workplace and a world competitive industrial relations system. Awards increasingly will be determined in the enterprise rather than the hearing rooms of the industrial relations system in a quasi&amp;hyphen;legal manner. Awards will be simplified. The new awards will deal only with core matters—sick leave, annual leave and jury leave.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Other terms and conditions will be determined at the workplace. The new legislation before the House will require management and employees to discuss and work out their own work conditions rather than rely on comprehensive awards to dictate every last detail.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There will be a new stream of non&amp;hyphen;union enterprise bargaining, the very thing that we on this side of the parliament say will put thrust back into enterprise agreements. Workplace agreements will be introduced and made possible without unwanted union interference, and they can proceed without the approval of the Industrial Relations Commission.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As all members of this House would know, Labor's enterprise flexibility agreements, supposedly designed for the non&amp;hyphen;union sector, required union involvement and approval by the commission, even when management and work force had agreed on various working conditions. What a strange set of arrangements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A union with no members at the workplace could argue against an agreement in the Industrial Relations Commission, and the commission could then reject it. We on this side of the House find it amazing that you
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          could have a union member with no connection to the workplace arguing against a set of conditions. The Tweed Heads case regarding sick leave was a classic example of the unions and the Industrial Relations Commission thwarting a legitimate enterprise agreement.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under coalition policy, approval by the commission will not be required, nor will unions have a guaranteed role. Safeguards will ensure that workers are not exploited and include a guarantee that take&amp;hyphen;home pay will not decrease relative to the award. Agreements will be lodged with employee advocates—funded by the government, I might add—who will act for the employees to ensure that they are not being disadvantaged.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I now turn to freedom of association. A key element of the bill before the House is that workers will be able to choose whether they join a union. No more the old story of no ticket&amp;hyphen;no start on building sites, which was strictly enforced by the militant BLF in days gone by. Preference clauses, giving union members preference in employment in several industries, will be removed from awards altogether. That in itself will be a major breakthrough for a number of industries where no ticket&amp;hyphen;no start has been very much the order of the day and no legal process has been able to overcome that long tradition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Preference clauses are one of the primary reasons for several industries being characterised as closed shops here in Australia and also in the UK. The coal industry, the oil industry and the waterfront are all characterised by compulsory membership of unions. All members of this House would be very aware of the impact monopoly coverage has had on those industries. It has ensured that they have had more than their fair share of strikes and industrial disputes. The current battle involving the CFMEU and Australian coal ports is a case in point, illustrating the way the union controls the waterfront.

        <para first-indent="16">
         No longer will what was once the only remaining issue—which union will be granted coverage of a particular workplace—be made on high in the Industrial Relations Commission. No longer will the commission or the union dominate over the freedom of choice

         There will be no more union monopolies. The `conveniently belong' rule will be done away with, with new unions being able to challenge the position of established unions.

No longer will the unions enjoy what union leaders have come to expect as a right—a total monopoly position.

         There will be a return to the secondary boycott provisions. Sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act will return to provide employers with injunctive relief against unions which engage in secondary boycotts. The Prime Minister, in 1974, was instrumental in bringing this measure in. It will provide protection for employers who find themselves the victims of industrial disputes which have nothing to do with them.

         The unfair dismissal laws will be amended to provide a fair go to employers and employees all round. It seems to me that an unfair dismissal action is about $7,000 a pop at the moment.

With the new bill we will get rid of the unfair dismissal laws, and I think there will be a great sigh of relief around Australia that this terrible provision full of legality has been removed.

         I will conclude by making the observation that at long last industrial relations will be related to the marketplace; they will be related to the ability of employees to work hard, to improve their capacities and their skills and be rewarded for merit and effort. No longer will Australian employees be regarded as one with no recognition for performance and no recognition that they might have different skills from their fellow workmates in the workplace. They will be able to be compensated for improving, for doing a better job.

         Therefore, with this new bill, productivity and efficiency in Australia will be improved immensely. We will have a highly competitive, export driven economy where workers know that the prosperity of Australia will depend on their efforts—and not on the decisions of the Arbitration Commission or the history of Justice Higgins, who brought down the famous Harvester judgment. This is a historic day in the Australian parliament.

         —I wish to bring to the attention of the House tonight a serious issue of injustice which has been suffered by two constituents of mine who were involved in the lease of a hotel. Patricia Lorraine Williams and Ernest Arthur Wilson were made bankrupt by virtue of sequestration orders made on 17 February 1986 and 23 April 1986 respectively in the Federal Court of Australia in proceedings No. 114 of 1986, No. NB 426 of 1986. They were
         <break page="2151" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          discharged from their bankruptcy three years later. The Official Trustee in Bankruptcy was appointed their trustee and has administered and continues to administer their bankrupt estate.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On 10 August 1988 a company, Welona Pty Ltd, lodged a proof of debt with the Official Trustee which resulted in a hearing arising out of the proof of debt taking place in the Federal Court before Sweeney J. on 6, 7 and 8 October 1992. In these proceedings, evidence was given by a director of Welona Pty Ltd, Ronald William Charles Bowen, in relation to certain photographs taken of the Gardeners Inn Hotel around which the dispute revolved. Welona Pty Ltd was the registered proprietor of the hotel. This led to photographs being identified by a witness, Mr Nigel Richmond Bell, and tendered as a result of direct evidence given by Mr Bowen, being exhibits 6, 7 and 8 in the proceedings. These photographs were all said to have been taken on 29 January 1985. An investigation has been carried out by Mr Wilson, Ms Williams and Mr John Whitfield as to the accuracy of the evidence given by Mr Bowen as to the date on which these photographs were taken.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It appears that a substantial number of the photographs could not have been taken on that date. There is one photograph, the subject of evidence given by Mr Bowen, that establishes that the evidence given in these proceedings was untrue. This is evidence given on page 103 of the transcript as to exhibit 8. In short, the evidence is that the photograph was taken in January 1985. From other evidence in the proceedings, the date in January is said to be 29 January 1985. The evidence is that a newspaper bearing the same date as the photographs was placed in the photographs to prove the date on which the photograph was taken, being January 1985. The date of the newspaper in the photograph is 14 March 1985.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are other photographs tendered in evidence which were definitely taken at a time other than 29 January 1985. Some of these photographs bear dates in 1983 and it is believed they were taken by Ronald Benson, who is deceased. Other photographs were taken later in 1985 after the hotel had been
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         renovated. This can be established by independent evidence.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other disturbing aspect of this case relating to the photographs is that in 1986 Wilson gave certain photographs which he says were taken earlier in the lease to James Thomas Garrett, an officer of the Insolvency and Trustee Service of Australia. On his own admission, Mr Garrett has sworn affidavits that these photographs were lost. However, some of these photographs formed part of exhibits 6 and 7 in the proceedings and more than likely exhibit 8, which was supposed to hold one photograph, and were eventually located by the writer with exhibits in the file of Wilson and Williams in the Federal Court, although said to have been missing at the time of the hearing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no explanation from Mr Garrett as to how this occurred and subsequently it is the contention of Wilson and Williams that the photographs were misused. The Official Trustee in Bankruptcy has been most reluctant to allow access to their files to investigate what occurred. They have had an internal investigation without allowing access to files and without interviewing Wilson and Williams. Their only conclusion is that the photographs were mislaid and this would result in updating internal procedures in the department.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Wilson and Williams are requesting investigation into this matter as to the evidence given by Mr Bowen as to the photographs and, in particular, the photograph containing the newspaper and the obvious discrepancy. My constituents are further requesting investigation into the matter of the photographs leaving the possession of the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy and who had access to such photographs. The possible misuse of these photographs is of great concern to my constituents.

         —I wish to raise tonight the issue of the formation of the Sydney Airport Community Forum—or, as it will be known from today, the North Shore hockey club. The composition of this committee is an absolute farce. This committee has excluded the area in which Sydney airport is actually located. The local government area of Botany, the state seat of Heffron and the federal seat of Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith will have no input into the future direction and operations of Sydney airport. Also, the federal seat of Sydney has no representation. The state seat of Marrickville, over which most of the planes fly, has also been excluded from representation, as have the state seats of Drummoyne and Ashfield.

        Furthermore, the local government area of Rockdale, the area most affected by the east&amp;hyphen;west runway to the west of that runway, is excluded from representation. Leichhardt Council, South Sydney Council, Drummoyne and Ashfield councils to the north of the airport have also been excluded.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When you look at the community representation this farce is exposed. You have five community representatives. There are three from the North Shore of Sydney. Bennelong is singled out to get a representative. No other electorate, no other local government area, has been singled out to get a community representative but Bennelong once again gets special treatment. The Upper North Shore also gets special treatment. The Liberal front group, the Sydney Airport Forum, also gets representation. There is one representative from Kurnell, and the area around the airport most affected—the inner west, the area within 10 kilometres of which you have to fly before you hit any other area—has just one representative. This shows the North Shore bias in this committee; it is an absolute rort. It exposes the hypocrisy in that this committee is going to be simply concerned with keeping planes away from the North Shore of Sydney and will not really be concerned with genuine representation and community accountability.

Frankly, it is just not good enough for the Minister for Transport and Regional Development to refuse to have any consultation with the residents most affected around areas such as Marrickville, Leichhardt, Sydenham and Rockdale and to ignore those areas and say that representation is solely on the basis of the people in Hunters Hill. They deserve representation. Let me say this: hearing is not equated to income. Working class people in the suburbs of Sydenham deserve exactly the same representation as the people of Hunters Hill.

There is a pile of forms on his desk from the department about problems, and they simply remain there—they are all deferred for consideration.

This is the story: a father, and it could equally have been a mother, had an access order to see his children. He went around to where they were and was denied access. He had a Family Court order and was permitted to see his children between the hours of one o'clock and five o'clock on that Saturday afternoon. He was denied access.

        On the Monday he went to see the Australian Federal Police to see what they might be able to do about it. Same story: `We can't do anything about it unless it is written on the court order.' I have now found out that the only recourse this father has is to go back to the Family Court. And what happens there the majority of times? It may take up to six months to get a hearing in the Family Court. Once he gets there, what happens? Whoever is in the Family Court probably rules that the other party is in contempt, but there is virtually no penalty. Why put on a penalty? The other party probably cannot afford a penalty anyway. You go around in a circle and six months later the fellow still has not had access to his children.

The group is headed up by my constituents Kim and Leah Boyd. Kim is the husband, and Leah is in very poor health and her health is worsening. There are tragic stories when one deals with constituents who have had to suffer the after&amp;hyphen;effects of breast implants and when one sees the litigation that has been going on in the United States. The preferential treatment that seems to have been given to American women who have had these implants compared with the great difficulties placed in the way of Australian women who have had exactly the same procedures is to be condemned both in this parliament and from every rostrum when we have the opportunity.

They are committed to helping and supporting women who have had or are considering the implantation of breast implants. They are committed to giving voice to women's experiences. They give the evidence of experts the same weight as they do the personal experiences of `uneducated women', as they are called: in other words, women who do not have the expertise or the resources available to express themselves as eloquently as do members of the medical fraternity and the legal people that they employ on their behalf.

These are people in poor circumstances who are going through a terrible stage in their life—if they have survived. They are unpaid volunteers, all of whom have had personal breast implant experience. They devote their own time and personal resources to helping other women in any situation that they may find themselves in.

         —I rise in the adjournment debate this evening to congratulate and encourage the Victorian Premier, Mr Jeff Kennett. I do so for the leadership he has shown in getting the drug debate up and running in Victoria. I think those who have been following the drug debate in Victoria could be forgiven for thinking that it was all about the legalisation of cannabis. In fact, Premier Kennett's Drug Advisory Council, under the chairmanship of the conservative medical academic David Penington, was the response to a series of heroin related deaths and, finally, an incident that was probably too confronting for any political leader and indeed the community.

        Why then did Professor Penington's council head off in the direction of cannabis and recommend liberalisation of cannabis laws to boot? The problem is that in the first instance tobacco—and young people from 12 to 17 years smoke 6&amp;half; million cigarettes every week—is the gateway drug that greatly increases the likelihood of young people trying marijuana when it is offered to them. In fact, those who smoke cigarettes are 28 times more likely to say yes to cannabis. Those who sell cannabis invariably have other drugs to peddle, thereby introducing their frequently innocent buyers to a variety of life&amp;hyphen;sapping products.

In the context of the debate which has just occurred in Victoria, and not often enough in other parts of Australia, people ought to remember that the national drug strategy has established that in one year over half of teenagers between the ages of 14 and 19 years will be offered cannabis. A quarter of them would have smoked it in the last 12 months and 40 per cent would have smoked it at some time in the past. The cannabis trade in Australia is estimated to be worth some $2 billion. In the state of Queensland, for example, the CJC estimates its total value at $652 million a year, second only to sugar as a cash crop.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Victorian government is to be given credit for now putting $25 million into drug education programs in Victoria. Even though we could go a lot further, compared with the national commitment of some $37 million for drug education, it is a substantial move in the right direction.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But what members of this chamber and, I think, Australians generally need to remember is that what we are doing with heroin, speed, cannabis and ecstasy is clearly not working. The legalisation of these drugs is not the answer either and those who think it is need
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         look no further than tobacco for evidence of failure. However, drug users and addicts in particular should be treated as the pitiable people that they are and much less like criminals. Those who peddle drug misery deserve much more attention from the law.

        We need to direct our energies to addressing those conditions which breed a disillusionment with the future and a sense of hopelessness about the present. If ever an issue begged leadership—glimpses of which we have seen from the Victorian Premier, Mr Jeff Kennett—it is this one. The Victorian Premier made the Victorian parliament available for discussion of this issue, about which all Australian parents in particular are concerned. It is a model that could be applied to this parliament not only for drug debates but, indeed, for other pressing issues of concern.

         —I would like to briefly address the issue of radiation safety. When the subject of radiation is mentioned, most people's first thoughts would be of nuclear fall&amp;hyphen;out. In Australia, concern about nuclear fall&amp;hyphen;out tends to focus on the after&amp;hyphen;effects of the French nuclear tests. Much more potent radiation is present at Maralinga—the site of British atomic bomb tests in the immediate postwar years. After some years of negotiation, the British government have agreed to contribute to the clean&amp;hyphen;up of plutonium contamination at Maralinga to make the area safer for human habitation.

        When nuclear energy is used as a fuel, as we saw at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, there is always the danger of an accident. While there are no nuclear power stations in this country, Australian ports are sometimes visited by nuclear&amp;hyphen;powered ships and we do have a reactor at Lucas Heights, so the possibility of some kind of emergency or accident is not totally remote.

         In our daily lives we have much greater contact with deadly radiation than many people may be aware.

This is thanks to the work carried out over many years by the Australian Radiation Laboratory, located in my electorate of Jagajaga in Melbourne.

         —Mr Speaker, may I commend you on your razor sharp vision and speak for a few moments on one of Australia's most respected business organisations: Australia Post. Nationally, Australia Post operates 4,300 outlets and handles about 100 million bill&amp;hyphen;paying transactions each year, growing by 34 per cent last year, and 3.8 billion mail articles are delivered annually to 7.7 million different points.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1994-95 Australia Post revenue grew by over eight per cent to $2.781 billion. It made a record profit of $331 million before tax, paid $106 million in tax and returned $120 million to the federal government by way of dividend. It also invested $270 million in modernising its retail network and further enhanced its computerised technology, now of such a high standard that other financial institutions such as American Express are clamouring to sign retail and back office agreements with Australia Post to use initiatives such as giropost. Australia Post is anticipating similar results for this financial year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Australia Post has changed. Its retail shops are a complete redesign of the traditional post office. Its staff are increasingly productive and, as I indicated, Australia Post is ahead of the field in technology. At local post offices

        Yet, despite these substantial improvements, Australia Post continues to engage the respected corporate design consultants Emery Vincent Associates in what will overall be a multimillion dollar assignment to add the word `post' to Australia Post's corporate identity. Almost two weeks after the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Age
        </emphasis>
        featured a story on 6 June in which Australia Post said that `no approval has been given for such change; it is still very early days' and talked of the current logo's icon status, Australia Post is yet to clarify the situation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Australia Post claims that it has been slowly introducing this `post' logo since 1991, that it is merely an evolutionary change and that the recognisable P-shaped logo has been retained in all cases. The organisation's stationery already bears the capitalised word `post' vertically along the right-hand margin and the former Australia Post logo still appears at the top of the letterhead. It is sort of an each&amp;hyphen;way bet. So what is the point?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the corporate design world these sorts of contracts are prized, but opinions differ. One Melbourne based consultant to whom my staff spoke suggested that Australia Post might consider repositioning itself in the marketplace. That might involve changing its logo. But, on its own, changing a logo will not amount to much. A major Sydney design consultancy said that Australia Post's current logo is good and does not jump out as being particularly dated. Ken Cato, Chairman of Cato Design Inc., in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian Financial Review
        </emphasis>
        on 3 October 1989, said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Design budgets are massive and many corporates don't understand what is being done . . . they end up spending too much and don't know it—the cost to pull down the old is often as much as the budget for the new identity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why Australia Post wants to delete the word `Australia' and reduce its relative significance is difficult to comprehend. Dropping or reducing the relative prominence of the word `Australia' from its well-designed logo goes against the trend. When Ansett last had a logo change they became Ansett Australia. Qantas retained the `Australian airline' motto when
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         it merged with Australian Airlines. By way of example, replacing just one moulded sign at each of the 1,500 major properties Australia Post operates would cost Australia Post $1.5 million, a further $300,000 for the 3,100 licensed post offices and community mail agencies, plus tens of thousands of dollars for internal signage, trucks and delivery vehicles requiring repainting.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Will our international mail go overseas with little or no marking of its country of origin? I thought we would be proudly pushing Australia's good name into the world economies at every opportunity. Australia Post does not need a new logo. The word `post' is in itself meaningless. According to
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         The Oxford English Dictionary
        </emphasis>
        , `post' has at least 87 different meanings and several hundred if the many words meaning `after' are included. Does Australia Post plan to market receiving a cheque in the mail as a new age post-post experience? The best explanation I have been able to obtain is that this `drip feed' change is just slowly being introduced—to what end, I am not sure.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I raise these issues because, despite these funds being expended, the plans to resite the Frankston delivery centre are moving very slowly and plans for its future are still uncertain. The majority of local traders, customers of the centre and the council strongly favour a replacement facility located close to Playne Street. I encourage Australia Post to meet with the Frankston City Council to see whether a new delivery centre could be located on the former Frankston police station site.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Committing available resources to continuous improvement in service, new products and service outlets that are responsive to customers' needs and the sensible use of cost-conscious technologies and premises are the way to go—not a needless and half&amp;hyphen;hearted corporate image `makeover'.

         <break page="2158" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          to establish a university campus at Midland. The provision of a university campus at Midland would provide Midland, the north-east corridor and the Shire of Swan with a massive economic and social boost.

        The preferred local site for a Midland university is the former site of the Midland Westrail railway workshops. In the run&amp;hyphen;up to the 1993 state election, the current state coalition government promised the retention of the workshops and its expansion into a modern engineering site. Unfortunately, less than three months after that government's election at the state level, they broke that promise and closed the workshops. Since that time there has been a strong local push to establish a university on the site. This has been led by the Shire of Swan and supported by local members of parliament, state and federal, and the community generally.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the last couple of years we have seen very many of the necessary building blocks put in place. During the last 12 months, the previous federal Labor government—in particular, the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean—ensured that funding was made available for 750 extra places for tertiary students in Western Australia over the next three to four years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As well, very many efforts were made at the local level urging the state government to adopt Midland campus as a priority for the state so far as capital development program funds were concerned. Members may be aware that Commonwealth capital development funds are accorded priority at the state level and that that guides the Commonwealth in its determination of grants from the capital development pool. More recently, we have seen in the last week or so Edith Cowan University initiate and launch university classes to be conducted by Edith Cowan University in conjunction with Midland TAFE at the site of the old Midland Westrail workshops.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All these building blocks and the prospect of a full university campus in Midland are now at risk. That has arisen from two matters. Firstly, at the federal level we have the mooted education cuts—as high as $600 million—and a failure on the part of the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         current federal government to guarantee the funding for the 750 extra places required in Western Australia—not just for a Midland campus but to cater for the growth which is occurring in my own state. Secondly, at the state level the state government has refused to give any indication as to its order of priority for capital development funds. A number of competing bids are in at the moment, including those for a Mandurah/Rockingham campus of Murdoch University and a Kalgoorlie campus of Curtin University. But there has been a deafening silence on the part of the state government as to its intentions in respect of the priority for capital development funds for a Midland university campus.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Requests for guarantees in respect of funding for the extra places and priority for capital development grants at the state level have fallen on deaf ears. Indeed, the federal member for Pearce, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), has been deafening in her silence in response to requests from me to guarantee funding. As well, her state colleague the member for Swan Hills, Mrs June van de Klashorst, has also been deafening by her silence in her failure or refusal to give any indication as to her government's priorities in the allocation of capital development grants.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The prospect of a boost to Midland and the prospect of the provision of a university campus for the north&amp;hyphen;east corridor of the metropolitan area are all now at risk and in jeopardy. The prospects are bleak as a consequence of mooted cuts at the federal level and the failure of the state government to accord priority for a Midland campus. What is required is the full commitment at the state and federal level to ensure a university is committed to a growth area of Western Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Midland is very well situated for a campus of a university, sitting as it does at the end of the metropolitan railway line, with good transport links in addition to railway. It is now the centre of a growing hub, particularly with developments in Stratton and Ellenbrook. That area of the north&amp;hyphen;east corridor has major growth prospects over the next decade. I again call upon the state and federal governments to accord priority to the provision of a Midland campus of a university.

        This simple but true comment attracted a vigorous response from the member for Werriwa, who sought to turn around my allegation and himself alleged that `for no good reason, he'—Tom Mutch—`became a Labor rat; he deserted the Labor cause'. My ancestor would probably turn in his grave just a little at this allegation. Having heard it all before from those ignorant of those turbulent days, he would be satisfied with me taking up the challenge of the member for Werriwa to give the House a full account of Tom Mutch's decision to leave the ALP or, rather, the decision of the ALP to leave him.

        I don't suppose that Tom could possibly have an opinion but I'd hold the opposite. But he has carried his swag with me and was, and is, the straightest mate I or anyone else ever had, and if he says he's going to do a thing, he's going to do it all right.

        And so, in 1927, when Tom Mutch and other good men in cabinet opposed on principle the notorious conference `red rules' where Lang assumed dictatorial powers, sacked his cabinet and appointed bootlickers, known as the `scabinet', Tom Mutch could do no other than to fight for principle.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As a consequence of this upheaval where Tom Mutch was elected leader of the Labor caucus opposed to Lang, a number of good men, including Mutch, lost fraudulent and rigged preselections—nothing much has changed I can see in the Labor Party—to the Lang forces, where longstanding league members who were Mutch supporters were struck from the roll of preselectors and new

        A number of sitting members contested the 1927 election. Mutch and Evatt were elected as independent Labor members, vindicating their stand but ensuring automatic expulsion from the ALP. Evatt's readmission and subsequent career in the ALP are ample acknowledgment of the fact that the stand taken by these men was acknowledged as one of principle. To condemn Tom Mutch is to also condemn Doc Evatt. At the time of his decision to stand as independent Labor, Tom Mutch addressed a public rally at the Mascot Town Hall. I quote from an unpublished biography by his niece Grace Doughty:

        The Labor Party to which I have given a lifetime's loyalty has recently, and I hope temporarily, fallen under the control of a group whose principles and methods are foreign to my conception of the aims and ideals of Australian democracy.

        In an MA thesis, G.E. Lewis says that `Mutch was prepared to sacrifice all for an important matter of principle' and that by 1930 he `had found himself in the position where the Labor Party had moved away from him'. Indeed, I think the ALP revealed its true colours and reverence for thuggery and other bastardry when, at the 1971 New South Wales conference, Paul Keating had a motion carried readmitting Lang to the ALP, which I think says it all about Paul Keating.

         —As our country concentrates its response to the Port Arthur tragedy in debating new gun laws, the question of mental health care has been mentioned but not deeply enough analysed to date as we seek answers to avoiding a repetition of the massacre of 28 April. I spoke last night in the Medicare levy amendment debate on the need to include a comprehensive review of our video violence, television coverage and mental health support programs in any serious attempt to stem the violence in our society. We not only need gun laws; we should be contemplating a total package of violence&amp;hyphen;reducing reform.

        We have just witnessed a human catastrophe with the taking of innocent lives in Port Arthur. But what were the consequences prevailing in the mind of the perpetrator before he took these lives? He was allegedly diagnosed as suffering from Paranoid Schizophrenia and his life riddled with mental anxiety, much of which may have been caused by his family dilemma. His intellect was allegedly that of an eight year old, as quoted by his friend. His friend also added that maybe if this fellow had received more substantial help with his mental trauma, this devastation may have not taken place.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are many things which contribute to the balance of life. In this instance, not only the issue of Gun Laws should be addressed, but the immediate and direct help that is needed for those who are mentally incapable of caring for themselves.

        I speak from experience. My younger sister, age 39 years, is also a sufferer of Paranoid Schizophrenia but with the added complexity of an intellectual disability. Sadly, she has been filed in the `too hard' basket in the eyes of the Mental Health Department. Dual diagnosis is very common. She had been institutionalised for a great many years. In the late 1980s, through the pros and cons of the Richmond Report and society's `Do-Gooders', my
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         sister and many hundreds of mentally ill&amp;hyphen;equipped people were `set free' from institutions to be taken to half&amp;hyphen;way or boarding houses. These lodgings were no more than business orientated fire traps. No supervision prevailed, medical help was scant, personal security and living conditions were appalling. My sister was indecently assaulted twice whilst in these lodgings. This is not the proper care that should be offered. She was shuttled to more than fifteen of these places. She never `fitted in'. I was told there was nowhere else for her in Sydney, so my husband, another sister and myself were asked to bring her here to Orange, which we did in January 1993. After months of trying several Group Homes, the same problems arose. Those in charge of my sister's well&amp;hyphen;being again said she did not fit into the system. They explained that the only option left was private accommodation with the help of social workers, Meals&amp;hyphen;On&amp;hyphen;Wheels and Home Help. Unfortunately, the help promised from the Mental Health team and Community Services was not consistent and did not last for long. More and more my sister became dependent on my help for her day to day requirements. This finally became a burden too heavy for my young family to carry. In January 1996, my sister was asked to leave her accommodation. The reason given was that she was very disruptive to the other private tenants.

        I am not an advocate of permanent institutionalisation for people with mental disabilities. I realise that there is a fine path between mental health and mental instability that many tread in this increasingly stressful world. But I firmly believe that governments have largely reneged on many of their responsibilities in the mental health area by too easily embracing the deinstitutionalisation philosophy. It clearly has not worked in many cases. The letter I just read proves it. I urge the government to seriously seek national consensus on uniform video and mental health laws as they have on gun laws.

These allegations are offensive, typical Labor revisionism and

        In 1933 Robert Menzies publicly defended parliamentary democracy, which he distinguished from dictatorial control. When Mussolini invaded Abyssinia in 1935, Joseph Lyons and his Attorney-General, Robert Menzies, imposed sanctions on Italy. Do you know who opposed them? Lang Labor and then subsequently the ALP. In fact, the ALP was the only Labor organisation in the world to oppose those sanctions. For the member for Werriwa's information, things have not changed all that much. During that parliamentary debate there were seven quorums called. To quote E.M. Andrews, `The Labor Party stressed past League failures as an excuse for backing Mussolini.'

       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1936, when Hitler occupied the Rhineland, several cabinet ministers were very bitter about the Germans. Their suspicion of Hitler was shown when Sir George Pearce, the Minister for External Affairs, rejected German arguments for the return of Australia's mandate in New Guinea. That rejection was reaffirmed by Lyons in 1938. Even after the fall of Abyssinia, Menzies gave Anthony Eden the impression that he wished to continue sanctions against Italy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Rather than supporting Mussolini, the imposition of sanctions made an enemy of him and led to the formation of the Axis between Italy and Germany. During the Spanish Civil War the Australian government was worried about Franco's methods of warfare and supported appeals to Franco to desist from bombing towns.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1937, the Australian government and the Department of External Affairs were suspicious of fascist influence in the Mediterranean, Australia's trade and defence lifeline at
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         that time. In 1939 Australia, along with many other countries, guaranteed support for Poland if invaded by Hitler. At that time there were cabinet ministers such as Gullett who said the Nazi regime was predatory and aggressive and Sir Charles Marr pointed to atrocities inside Germany. Just remember, in 1940, after the fall of France, Australia was the third major country in the alliance against fascism.

        In another Commonwealth country, South Africa, there was a relatively narrow parliamentary vote in favour of South Africa joining the Allies as opposed to remaining neutral. Many subsequent leaders of that country were Nazi sympathisers and actively worked during the war to hinder the Allied effort. To suggest that Australia has a tradition like that is wrong. In Australia there were no quislings. To suggest that Menzies and Lyons would have been happy to set up a Vichy-style government is wrong.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What about the ALP when they were in government? In 1943, Arthur Calwell, when a minister, called for Italia Libera, an anti-fascist organisation, to go out of existence. He also appointed a leading fascist to be the unofficial Italian liaison officer in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not suggest Calwell and the ALP supported the fascists. They did not. But if banning anti-Nazi plays indicated fascist support, then the Labor controlled Collingwood Council was also guilty. If administering that infamous Gaelic test to Egon Kisch was tacit fascist support, then it is worth remembering that that movement against war and fascism was also opposed by the Melbourne Trades Hall Council and the Victorian Labor Party.

        Lyons was determined to avoid another world war. In following appeasement they were sensitive to the criticism of dictators. But look at the sort of people who were criticising the dictators. Eric Baume, who is an uncle of a current Liberal senator, was a fierce critic of the Nazis. He was such a strong critic that he was taken off 2GB.

       (1) The Telecommunications (Exempt Activities) Regulations made under the Telecommunications Act 1991 allow carriers to engage in specified activities without being subject to certain State and Territory laws. These laws include environmental, heritage, town planning, powers and functions of a local government body, use of land, tenancy and the supply of fuel and power. The carriers must comply with the Telecommunications National Code when undertaking activities exempt from certain State and Territory laws.

       This framework, operating in lieu of normal State and Territory planning laws, will continue until replaced by a scheme of proper planning processes, preferably from 1 July 1997, which will be developed in consultation with States, Territories and Local Government.

       (2) The Government is mindful of the important role local government can play in assessing any proposal relating to the erection of telecommunications facilities and therefore it is intended to continue and strengthen the requirements relating to consultation with local government in relation to proposals to erect facilities within their boundaries. As noted above, the Government will also, in consultation with States, Territories and Local Government be considering what scheme should replace the current scheme in the longer term.

       The issue of voter identification at polling booths was examined by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its enquiry into the conduct of the 1993 federal election. In its November 1994 Report to the Parliament entitled "The 1993 Federal Election" the Committee concluded that all objective evidence indicated that fraud was not a significant occurrence and did not influence any result at the 1993 federal election. The Committee did not support a requirement for proof of identity at polling booths.

       However, in a dissenting report by Mr David Connolly MP, Senator Nicholas Minchin, Senator John Tierney, and Mr Michael Cobb MP, it was stated that the conclusion of the majority was too complacent. The dissenting report recommended a number of measures to tighten up electoral procedures, including the trial of voter identification cards at a by&amp;hyphen;election.

       In the light of the dissenting report, the Government will be giving further consideration to this issue.

To achieve this we are making the labour market more flexible and improving the regulatory environment for small business. These measures will stimulate the economy and enable businesses to expand. Other priority areas are support and assistance for families with children, and the introduction of the Family Tax Initiative is a major commitment in this area; sole parent pensioners; women; carers; the aged; and indigenous Australians.

       Australia's aid program is the Government's principal contribution to the direct alleviation of poverty in developing countries. The Government is committed to helping developing countries meet the basic needs of their people and intends to strengthen the focus of the aid program on humanitarian activities with tangible benefits for the poor. The Government believes that it is particularly timely in the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty for the priorities, objectives and focus of the aid program to be re&amp;hyphen;examined. Accordingly the Minister for Foreign Affairs has recently commissioned an independent review of the aid program which will examine how the program can best contribute to lasting poverty reduction in developing countries.

       In response to a public call by Qantas in early 1995 for Expressions of Interest for the Supply of Printed Matter, the AGPS Information Solutions Group submitted a proposal to provide an information management and print procurement service to Qantas. This includes ISG management of the Qantas internal printing facilities. Negotiation of an agreement between Qantas and AGPS for the provision of these services is yet to be finalised; (a) This is subject to the current negotiations with Qantas; (b) The main component of the AGPS proposal is the provision of information management and print procurement services not printing services. Under the proposal it is envisaged that a greater percentage of Qantas' print requirements will be sourced from private sector print suppliers than is currently the case.
