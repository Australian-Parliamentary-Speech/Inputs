        The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 serves to make various portfolio amendments to social security and associated legislation. A number of government amendments and a request for an amendment were moved to the bill in the Senate. These related to the following areas: requiring a qualification assessment to be made for either disability support pension or disability wage supplement if a person has been subject to a compensation preclusion decision, has appealed to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal about that decision and has requested the assessment to be made; making some minor technical amendments to the partner allowance qualification provisions; changing the commencement dates for those initiatives relating to the qualifying age for the seniors health card and revised income test arrangements for certain under-18-year-old beneficiaries; and the international social security agreement between Australia and Italy. These amendments and the request for an amendment were unanimously supported by the Senate.

         —I think this matter needs some clarification because I had some difficulty following it myself. We dealt with these matters, I thought, substantially on 31 August. But, in fact, on that occasion we dealt with only the request and the other matters mentioned by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). Exactly the same speech was read word for word today. If you read

        The Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 provides for the implementation of a number of minor initiatives. A number of government amendments and a request for an amendment were moved to this bill in the Senate. These related to refining a qualification criterion for the sole parent pension, omitting proposed amendments relating to the disclosure of information and changing the commencement date for an initiative relating to the restoration and suspension of fringe benefits to disability support pensioners. These amendments and the request for an amendment were unanimously supported by the Senate.

        In addition, a number of non-government amendments were successfully moved to the bill. These related to the reviewability of certain decisions of the employment secretary and the Minister for Social Security; the continuation, variation and termination of determinations, with the result that social security payments will not necessarily cease to be payable even though a person has lost qualification and there will be no period of grace for maximum payment rate debts; and making a notice issued by the Minister for Social Security specifying a class of debts that may be waived, a disallowable instrument, and making that notice effective only after the expiration of the disallowance period. Although the government did not support these amendments in the Senate, it will not press that opposition.

         —The Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 was introduced into this House on 29 June. That has some significance, which I will come to later. The bill proposes changes to six acts but primarily to the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The most significant provisions of the bill would amend the unfair dismissal provisions of that act.

         The bill provides that an employee's application for relief under the unfair dismissal provisions is to be heard first by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission rather than by the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, as is presently the case. The explanatory memorandum states that an application to the Industrial Relations Commission will be treated as an attempt to settle the matter by conciliation between the employer and the employee.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, the bill would allow the Industrial Relations Commission to undertake so-called `consent' arbitration in relation to termination of employment matters with the agreement of the parties. Subject to a right of appeal, the decision made by the Industrial Relations Commission in  consent arbitration will be binding on the parties. The only currently available means of redress before the commission for a claim of unfair dismissal is a process of non-binding conciliation.

         Thirdly, the bill requires the Industrial Relations Court to decline to deal with an unfair dismissal claim if the court is satisfied that the former employee has access to an alternative remedy under another law which satisfies the requirements of the International Labour Organisation's convention No. 158 on the termination of employment. There is a body of law as to the meaning of `adequate alternative remedy' in the context of the existing provision in the Industrial Relations Act. I will say more about this aspect of the bill in a moment.

         The bill will also require the Industrial Relations Court to consider all the circumstances in each case in determining whether a remedy for unfair dismissal should be granted and what form that remedy, if any, should take. Although an employer may have followed a technically defective procedure when ending the former employee's employment, the employer may have had a very good reason of substance for dismissing the employee. As the explanatory memorandum shows, this provision is a recognition by the government of the idiocy of the existing law which gives an employee a remedy for such a technically unlawful dismissal.

The latter will redefine `waterside workers' as `stevedoring employees'. The bill also contains proposed changes increasing the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission in relation to coal industry matters.

         The two aspects of the bill that I will address relate to the Industrial Relations Court and the changes to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act. I question the need for a separate Industrial Relations Court. This is not the first time that I have done so. When the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993 was passing through the parliament in November 1993 I contributed to the second reading debate. A key aspect of the 1993 reform bill was the creation of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia. The reform bill eliminated the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia in industrial matters and transferred those matters to the Industrial Relations Court.

         The coalition opposed this for several reasons: first, the government failed to demonstrate any need at all to set up the new court; secondly, the establishment of specialist courts operating in narrow fields is undesirable; and, thirdly, the new court results in unnecessary additional cost to taxpayers. In 1956, in the Boilermakers case, the High Court limited the ability of bodies constituted other than by federal judges to determine judicial questions or exercise judicial power. As a result, the judicial functions of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, as it then was, were transferred to the Commonwealth Industrial Court. The Commonwealth Industrial Court later became the Australian Industrial Court.

         In 1976 the Federal Court of Australia was established with a general division and a specialist industrial division. With the establishment of the Federal Court, the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Court was transferred to the industrial division. The Federal Court's jurisdiction in federal industrial matters continued following the enactment of the Industrial Relations Act in 1988.

         When, in November 1993, I opposed the creation of the Industrial Relations Court I drew the attention of this House to the government's complete silence in regard to explaining the need for the establishment of this new court. The government provided no rationale in either the second reading speech or the explanatory memorandum that accompanied the reform bill, and nothing was offered in the subsequent debate. At the time I said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This silence is really quite extraordinary. The Government is proposing, in effect, to abolish a whole division of the Federal Court and create a new federal judicial body. It has not bothered to say why it is proposing to do that.
       </para>
       <para>
        I went on to explain why the government should have, and should give, a good reason for removing jurisdiction from the Federal Court and giving it to a new Industrial Relations Court. I said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The courts are one of the three branches of our system of government. Insulation of the judicial system from arbitrary executive or legislative whim is vital in securing the integrity of our courts. For that reason alone, the Parliament should refuse to entertain elimination of significant jurisdiction of the Federal Court tantamount to an abolition of an entire division of the court without a detailed explanation as to why. It may well be that the Government has reasons which it believes justify this change. If so, it should advance those reasons publicly so that they can be scrutinised and debated. Without any reasons being offered, there is the potential for a perception of an improper motive, and a perception of impropriety can be as subversive as impropriety itself.
       </para>
       <para>
        I went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If the concern is about the content of laws applied in the industrial area, the focus of attention should obviously be those laws. We do not reform laws regarded as inappropriate by changing the court which administers them.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said at the time:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . it is inappropriate that a judicial body be structured in such a way that its membership or its operation should advance a particular social purpose.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I also explained that, in relation to specialist courts generally, the objection is that they develop a limited range of expertise and they tend to have input from a limited range of persons. Because of their constant association with that small range or persons and that limited range of subjects, specialist courts develop a limited outlook that a court of broader jurisdiction does not suffer from. On a more pragmatic level, there is the question of cost. As I said in 1993, it is difficult to see how the court could be set up without significant expense.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I was also concerned about provision being made for unfair dismissal cases to be heard not by a judge but by a judicial registrar. They can undertake most of the routine work of the court. Their decisions are, however, subject to review by a judge. In other words, their decisions are not final. In practical terms, this means that if a party does not like the result before a judicial registrar the party can, subject to certain procedural limitations, have another bite at the cherry. This is a waste of Commonwealth resources and is discriminatory.

         It is a right not accorded to any other litigant bringing or defending what is, on proper analysis, a common law claim. It is also expensive for the party who may have to defend the same hearing twice. There are alternative, better solutions. The Commonwealth could have created a court at the intermediate level, the level of the county and district courts in the state jurisdictions, or at the level below—such as a federal magistrate's court. Those courts could hear applications and make non-reviewable decisions, having the authority of a judge.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There need not, of course, be a court created solely for dealing with industrial matters. There is a range of federal matters that could be dealt with in the intermediate courts or federal magistrate's court. Alternatively—and this would be much simpler—the Commonwealth could invest intermediate courts in state jurisdiction or state magistrate's courts with federal jurisdiction to hear the applications. Better still, one might ask: why create the federal jurisdiction in the first place when there already exists state jurisdiction?

         , Professor Breen Creighton and Associate Professor Andrew Stewart, wrote in the 1994 edition of their book:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That said, it is not at all clear that the creation of the [Industrial Court] will serve any useful purpose. If the principal rationale for establishing a separate court was that it could be comprised of persons with a particular expertise in the industrial relations arena, then it is hard to see that the new court enjoys any significant advantage over the former Industrial Division . . . It is tempting to conclude, therefore, that the creation of the court was largely a matter of political expediency rather than legal or industrial necessity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Presently, the Industrial Relations Court is comprised of 10 judges, including the Chief Justice, Justice Murray Wilcox. All the members of the court hold concurrent commissions on the Federal Court of Australia and regularly participate in its work. Registries are in some cases shared between the Federal Court and the Industrial Relations Court. In light of that, there is little difference between the Industrial Relations Court so constituted and the Federal Court sitting in its industrial division. In the absence of real differences in relation to personnel and facilities, one may query again the need for the expensive and unexplained change in the first place.

         As to the cost of the Industrial Relations Court, the court in 1994-95 employed the equivalent of 52 full-time staff. According to the 1995-96 budget papers, this will increase to 86 during the present financial year. The court's running and associated costs for 1994-95 were just over $10 million. These will increase to slightly under $12 million in the current financial year.

         There have not been comparable savings in the running and associated costs for the Federal Court for 1994 as against 1993-94. In fact, the costs of that court increased by approximately $2 million. In consequence, it can be seen that the taxpayer has borne a significant burden—a burden that will continue each year that the Industrial Relations Court exists.

         If there is any difference between the jurisdiction formerly exercised by the Federal Court's industrial division and that now exercised by the Industrial Relations Court, it is in the unfair dismissals area. The effect is that the government has burdened taxpayers with annual expenditure of more than $10 million in creating a new superior court in order to deal with unfair dismissal cases. But those cases are not and should not ordinarily be dealt with by a superior court in any event. Under this bill, those cases will now go in the first instance to the Industrial Relations Commission. The government really seems to have no idea what it is doing in relation to the Industrial Relations Court.

         I also want to comment on the amendments proposed in relation to unfair dismissals. As I said earlier, with this bill the government is requiring a body hearing an application for reinstatement or compensation in the event of an unfair dismissal to have regard to `all the circumstances of the case' when deciding whether an employer had a valid reason under the Industrial Relations Act for dismissing an employee. The intention appears to be to oblige the Industrial Relations Commission and the Industrial Relations Court to put more weight on the overall merits of each particular case. This may help to tip the scales which are weighted heavily towards the employee back towards the employer a little. As the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) said in his second reading speech:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . there should not be any guarantee of a remedy where the only defect in the employer's conduct has been some failure to provide procedural fairness and the employee's conduct warrants dismissal.
       </para>
       <para>
        The bill proposes that the Industrial Relations Court decline to deal with an application for relief from an unfair dismissal if the former employee has access to a suitable alternative remedy under a law of the Commonwealth, state or territory which satisfies the requirements of articles 4 to 11 of the ILO Convention on the Termination of Employment.

         If the court is compelled to decline to deal with an application, the effect is that the employee must seek a remedy available under the relevant state system. Under the existing federal law, the Industrial Relations Court must decline to deal with an application for reinstatement or compensation in respect of a termination of employment when there is alternative machinery which satisfies the ILO convention. So if there is any defect in the state machinery, the Industrial Relations Court may hear the application and is not obliged to leave it to the alternative state body.

         In his second reading speech the assistant minister said that the government always intended that dismissed employees use state remedies rather than federal provisions when the state remedies provide satisfactory protection against unfair dismissals. The assistant minister admitted that the legislation has operated `more strictly than anticipated so that only state laws which virtually replicate the federal legislation could be treated as adequate alternative remedies'. The government says that under the bill a state will be able to give effect to the ILO convention in its own way. In other words, the government's intention is that a state system that provided less than the federal Industrial Relations Act in terms of employee entitlements may be adequate, as long as it meets the requirements of convention 158.

         It is not clear that the government's proposals for amendments in this area can achieve that aim or will implement that intention. The latest doubt has arisen since this bill was introduced on 29 June this year. It arises from the decision of the Industrial Relations Court in the case of Willcocks v. Makfren Holdings Pty Ltd, which was handed down on 22 August 1995. In that case, His Honour Justice Lee found that Western Australia's dismissal laws failed to provide an adequate remedy because they fell short of the protections required by convention 158, but it appears that His Honour's statement of the requirements of the convention means that very few, if any, of the state systems would be adequate.

         If it is to satisfy ILO convention 158, according to the decision in the Willcocks case, the state system must impose a requirement on the employer to exercise procedural fairness. That means an employer would be prohibited from dismissing an employee without giving an employee an opportunity to defend allegations made against him or her. State industrial relations commissions would lose the right to overlook minor breaches of procedural fairness in cases where a worker clearly deserved to lose his or her job. This is in contrast to the stated intention to operate at the federal level behind the provisions of this bill.

         Secondly, the Willcocks decision identifies as a requirement of article 9 of the convention that the employer must bear the burden of proving that there was a valid reason for terminating the employee's employment. On that basis, it will not be enough for the employer to show that there is a ground on which the commission could find that the dismissal was justified.

         The effect of the Willcocks case may be that the states are required to give employees even greater protection than exists under the federal system. Unless a state complies with the strict Willcocks requirements, no unfair dismissal case will be heard under that state's system; all will be heard in the federal arena. Ironically, the provisions of this bill introduce measures falling short of the Willcocks interpretation of the ILO convention requirements.

         If the Willcocks decision is not successfully appealed against, the government's amendments to the unfair dismissal laws may be unworkable. At the least, they may have unintended consequences. This should be enough to make the government rethink its attempt to reform the federal unfair dismissal laws. Certainly, when in government, the coalition will give a priority to ensuring that the laws are practical, realistic and provide equity to all parties. This bill is yet another example of the difference between this government and the next.

        As has been observed consistently by this side in this debate, this legislation was originally, and as it is now to be amended, a payback to the unions for their efforts in the 1993 election. To the extent that it has been a pay-back, it demonstrates as obviously today as at any other time what a great disservice those particular activities were to the Australian people.

         For instance, we read today of a report from Access Economics that indicates that the total tax burden on workers is greater now than it was 10 years ago when the then Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), unveiled his historic tax reform package. So the activities of the unions in support of the government back in 1993, for which this legislation is a simple payback, have certainly turned out not to be in the interests of Australians, certainly not those that the Australian Labor Party would claim particularly to represent in this place.

         In his second reading speech on this legislation the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) claimed that the changes proposed in this latest bill `will make a good system better'. That is quite an extraordinary claim for the assistant minister to make because these changes have come about in response to the fact that the original legislation was not working and was having a serious impact on business and the willingness of business to employ people at a time of huge unemployment. If anything, the minister should have said, and we would concede, that this legislation makes a bad system marginally better, because that is about all it does.

I got access to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's comments on unfair dismissal in Australia and, particularly, their discussion paper. One has only to read the first paragraph to realise how capable this minister is of overstating things or gilding the lily.

What that report demonstrated for us all was the gap we have in this country for which this government has no answer; that is, the huge gap between potential and performance. It was this issue which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) asked the Prime Minister a question about in parliament yesterday. He referred the Prime Minister to the report of the World Bank, which showed that Australia is an extremely rich and fortunate nation through its endowment of natural resources, and to the Standard and Poor's warning on Australia's unfavourable current account deficit and runaway foreign debt.

As we have repeated in this place on many occasions, it was the direction that the Prime Minister, as Treasurer, wanted to go back in in 1985. He was right then. We were right in 1993, but for blatant political ends and means that opportunity we had back in 1993 was defeated.

         It is actually worse than that because the financial assistance given by this government to unions is a two-way street. In 1992-93 the unions received $14 million from the government.

         I might just take a few moments—I will not delay the House overly long—to highlight some of the most blatant of those errors. During the debate the member for Flinders claimed that the Industrial Relations Court had ordered an employer to pay compensation to a funeral worker who had cremated the wrong body—a pretty serious allegation to make in respect of the workings of the court. I am informed that that claim is absolutely wrong, absolutely incorrect. The court found that the employee had followed the established procedure and that it was the manager of the funeral parlour who was most responsible for what could only be termed a very unfortunate occurrence—not the worker but the manager of the funeral parlour.

There have been cases where dismissal has been upheld because there was a conviction or, indeed, upheld even without a conviction where there were suspicious circumstances for which an employee was unable to account but for which he or she was responsible. That is the reality of it—not as was portrayed here in the House by the honourable member.

He made that claim despite the fact that the electricity commission case was a decision of the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission—not a decision made by a federal tribunal, not a body acting under federal legislation at all, but a decision made by a New South Wales tribunal under New South Wales law. It just happened to be made at the time the Fahey government was in office and made in accordance with the Fahey government's laws.

         Let me make it absolutely clear: these mischievous claims that they have repeatedly made about the provisions are far more likely to deter employers than any of the actual provisions in the act. The opposition's claims have been overwhelmingly misleading. In fact, it was the opposition who claimed that there is no defence for employers faced with frivolous applications—no defence. They have said this again and again; it has been repeatedly asserted by them. But the reality is that the court can award costs against a party who brings a vexatious claim or who brings a claim without reasonable cause. In fact, the court has used that power available to them and awarded costs in those circumstances. This is a matter of fact, not fiction.

         The unfair dismissal provisions have certainly not stopped employment growth in our country. That is borne out by the July 1995 unemployment rate, down to 8.2 per cent, the lowest it has been for 4 1/2 years. One and a bit years into the operations of the Industrial Relations Reform Act, it is the lowest rate of unemployment for 4 1/2 years. In that year to July 1995, 307,800 new jobs were created—307,800! I might say, 12,000 more jobs than in the year to July 1994. So it cannot be claimed that it stopped employment growth. On the contrary, employment growth has continued to gather pace.

         The opposition have claimed that the unfair dismissal provisions are driving employers only to engage part-time or casual employees. But analysing the figures shows that 210,700, or the great majority, 68 per cent, of the jobs created in the year to July 1995 were full time. That in itself is an improvement on the year to July 1994 when 57 per cent, 169,400, of the jobs created were full-time positions. So a greater percentage of full-time jobs has been created out of the record jobs growth while the Industrial Relations Reform Act has been operating.

         When you analyse what is happening with employment in Australia you see the absolute lie in what has been suggested by the opposition. Part-time employment has actually been growing since 1978. Part-time employment is no new phenomenon. More and more workers have opted for part-time employment as they seek more flexible working hours. There is no better indication of that than the survey in December 1994 which indicated that over 75 per cent of part-time workers do not want to work more hours. That is the wish of the workers. So you cannot say that part-time employment has been caused by the unfair dismissal provisions. There is no substance in that assertion at all.

         This is a matter that has to an extent been protection afforded under federal awards for many years. But the real difficulty has been enforcing award provisions on unfair dismissal. That has been a constitutional impediment to such enforcement. This is a burden that has applied for years under the relevant state legislation across the length and breadth of Australia except in Victoria where, of course, the Kennett government most unfairly abolished these protections—a move which has seen more than 300,000 workers transfer from the state system to the protection of the federal umbrella.

         The burden is not particularly large for small business either, as has been asserted by the opposition.

The amendments that are now before the House reinforce that there need not be a remedy in the absence of substantive injustice. We are making that very clear.

         The second matter put forward by the honourable member was his claim of the lack of proper prior consultation. I point out to the House that the consultation process that led to the presentation of the Industrial Relations Reform Act was absolutely exhaustive. It went on for the best part of a year. It ill becomes the opposition to talk about a lack of consultation, because it was the opposition who themselves rejected—and they went to great lengths to express this view when the legislation was being prepared and debated—the concept of unfair dismissal as being any sort of a proper subject for federal legislation. That is what they have always expressed as their view. Their comments certainly did not affect the government's resolve to provide proper protection for Australian workers.

         On this point, it is worth remembering that, as late as 14 August this year, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) pledged that the coalition would throw out the existing provisions relating to unfair dismissals. This is where they are coming from. The fact is that the government has continued to listen to all responsible employer organisations just as we have listened to the ACTU. We have done so continuously since the introduction of the legislation. That does not sound like insufficient consultation; on the contrary. Let me say here today that we will always continue to listen and bring forward any changes that from time to time we consider appropriate in the light of unfolding events.

        This bill amends the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 to provide an appropriation of $83,636,000 for the 1996 calendar year.

         Funding under the act is appropriated on a triennial calendar year basis, with the current triennium due to finish at the end of 1995. The government intends to make major changes to the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program from January 1997, with a new funding triennium to commence at that time. Those changes will provide for a more equitable basis for the distribution of funds on a per capita basis and new accountability arrangements that focus on achieving improved educational outcomes for indigenous people. To allow time to implement these substantial changes, 1996 will be used as a transitional period. Funding at existing levels is therefore required for the 1996 calendar year.

         This bill is an important element of the government's long-term strategy to improve education opportunities and outcomes for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders.

It provides a shared framework to the year 2001 for collaborative strategies to achieve equity of educational opportunity and outcomes for indigenous people.

         Many factors contribute to educational disadvantage for indigenous people. Education systems may not adequately accommodate students' cultural backgrounds.

         In late 1993 the Commonwealth appointed an independent reference group to examine the effectiveness of strategies developed in the first triennium of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. This national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples reported in late 1994 that there had been broadly based improvements in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education since the policy was implemented. For example, between 1989 and 1993 the percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students staying on to year 12 at school increased from 14 per cent to about 33 per cent. During the same period, the number of indigenous people attending university doubled.

         However, the national review also found that, despite these encouraging improvements, indigenous people remain the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. From preschool to higher education, Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders participate and attain significantly less in education than the rest of the community. For example, at primary school level, three times as many indigenous students have literacy and numeracy problems as do other primary students.

         —It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1995. Let there be no doubt that the coalition fully supports funding the education of Aboriginal Australians and, as such, the coalition supports the bill before the House. That is not to say, however, that the coalition does not have justified concerns regarding the legislation. The coalition firmly believes that the reconciliation process needs education as a fundamental base, otherwise it will fail to achieve the aims of reconciling indigenous and non-indigenous Australia.

         Let me also reaffirm the coalition's belief that education is fundamental to relieving the social disadvantages experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. What must be kept in mind is that education is often part of a much larger picture which involves health, housing and, importantly, employment opportunities.

         This bill is part of the government's overall national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, AEP, which commenced in 1990. This program has now been running for five years. The amendments proposed by this bill relate to funding of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, AESIP, referred to earlier by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free). This program provides funds to organisations and institutions to supplement the cost of delivering educational services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The main amendment of this bill will increase the appropriation for the funding period 1 January 1996 to 30 June 1997 from $0.256 million to $83.636 million.

         For the second triennium of funding, the Commonwealth nominated three national priorities. The first of these includes responding to the relevant recommendations of the royal commission into black deaths in custody, which includes increased employment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education workers from 1993 and an expansion of preschool services from 1994. The government also nominated implementing the national Aboriginal languages and literacy strategy as a national priority for the second triennium. The AEP components of the strategy include the Aboriginal literacy strategy, which provides an intensification of efforts to improve English literacy among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander school children and adults with limited experience at school. It also includes the Aboriginal languages education strategy, which aims to promote and facilitate the teaching of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages in school, develop bilingual education programs and will move towards the teaching of Aboriginal languages in TAFE and higher education.

This strategy aims to develop appropriate and consistent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander curriculum studies for all schools from preschool to year 12, develop consistent teacher  education courses, establish a sister school scheme and promote a greater understanding by students of their local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and its history.

         At about this time last year, when speaking on the 1994 appropriation for the mentioned programs under this bill, my colleague the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) made it very clear that there is a need for quantitative performance indicators, given the amount of money expended in this area. In fact, this bill provides for the allocation of $83.636 million. The coalition still believes that what is more important than the amount of money being spent is the results that this expenditure yields.

         It is Labor Party philosophy through and through to allocate enormous sums of money to a problem and hope that that alone will solve it. Labor is not interested in results; it is only interested in the processes. Labor is not interested in the ends; it is only interested in the means. It should be a cause of great concern for all members of this House that still the educational standards of Aboriginal people are not rising in proportion to the amount of money being allocated to them. Where there have been improvements, they are welcomed and encouraged by the opposition. But unfortunately they are few and far between. Given the government's announced allocation of $135.9 million in this year's budget for Aboriginal education, the results should be there for all to see.

         A recent survey conducted by the ABS of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders presents a statistical summary of the current situation regarding the education and training of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This survey reveals some startling statistics. The survey found that school participation rates declined significantly with age. For 14-year-olds the participation rate was 98 per cent, while for 17-year-olds this rate had fallen to 31 per cent. To be fair, the survey also found that 86 per cent of parents surveyed were happy with their children's education, 84 per cent were made to feel welcome at their children's school and 39 per cent were involved in the decision making at the school, while 85 per cent of students aged 13 and over—that is, those still in the education system—were happy with the education they were receiving.

         Unfortunately, the good news ends there. The level of post-educational attainment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is at an appallingly low level. Only 17 per cent of those surveyed had obtained a post-school education qualification. It should be of deep concern that only seven per cent had obtained the year 12 school certificate with only 29 per cent obtaining the year 10 school certificate. The survey also showed that 48 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people only attained a level of education below year 10 or did not have any formal education—that is nearly 50 per cent.

Of that 17 per cent I referred to, 26 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had attained basic vocational qualifications while 24 per cent held skilled vocational qualifications. It is nothing short of disgraceful that only 13 per cent of those surveyed held diplomas, six per cent held bachelor degrees and only one per cent held postgraduate qualifications. Only one per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people hold postgraduate qualifications. This, unfortunately, is the state of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education in Australia.

         There is no need for these figures to read like they do when one considers that almost over $10 billion has been spent over the last 20 years to improve the standards of education of Aboriginal people in Australia. After five years of the AEP and the AESIP, this bill provides an appropriate time to reflect on its stated aims and achieved outcomes.

         In 1988 the Commonwealth established an Aboriginal education policy task force to develop a comprehensive long-term approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. The task force found that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. The task force stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australians take it for granted, as an inalienable right of citizens in this country, that their children will receive at least 10 years of education, as well as the benefits of early childhood education. However, these fundamental rights have not been extended to all Aboriginal families.
       </para>
       <para>
        The task force went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Moreover, access to and participation in education for Aborigines beyond the age of 15, whether in senior secondary school, technical and further education or higher education, remains at unacceptably low levels generally.
       </para>
       <para>
        The response to the task force was the establishment of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, AEP, which has underpinning it the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program. This is the program for which funding is provided in this bill. The purpose of the AEP was designed to address the education needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students as revealed by the task force. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training stated his firm belief to the House on 23 August last year:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commonwealth remains committed to the AEP, which addresses the inequality of educational opportunities and outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Aboriginal people.
       </para>
       <para>
        The figures I quoted earlier clearly show that this is not the case. After more than five years of the program, the original conclusions drawn by the task force are as relevant in 1995 as they were in 1988, despite the rhetoric and despite the allocation of considerable expenditure.

         In 1993 the Commonwealth government commenced a national review of its program for the education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In short, the review group concluded that since the joint policy had been in effect for five years it was a suitable time to, and I quote from the final report:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . reflect on whether or not it has been successful in improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's involvement in, access to, participation in, and outcomes from, education.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously there was a view at the time that the program was not achieving their aims. One voice of concern was that of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who made no secret of his concerns about the government's approach to Aboriginal education. In an address to the Australian Medical Association in March of last year, seven months before the review of the program was released, the minister pleaded:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I want the Ross Frees and Simon Creans of this world to put Aboriginal education up there in lights, to fight for people's basic right to an education. And again I come back to that access and equity principle.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously, the minister was convinced that the government was not doing enough in this area and that achievements were minimal. In October of 1994 the review found that, happily, the education experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had improved over the last five years—and, might I say, so they should have. However, the report was quick to note that the government had failed to address the inequality of opportunities and outcomes in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education. It stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities are not achieving equitable outcomes—culturally, economically or politically—from their education.
       </para>
       <para>
        The figures I have cited earlier from the Australian Bureau of Statistics are a clear reflection of this failure. Despite finding that educational experiences had improved for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the past five years, the conclusion drawn by the review report in October of last year was not much different from those drawn by the task force in 1988, which concluded:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People remain the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia.

        The National Review of Education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples concluded in 1994:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait islanders continue to be the most educationally disadvantaged groups in Australia.
       </para>

         The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), in his former capacity as Minister for Employment, Education and Training, stated in this House on 31 August 1993 that the government's program in this area `addresses the inequality of education opportunities between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Aboriginal people'. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training stated in this House on 23 August last year:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

       <para font-size="-=2">
        This government has taken the lead to accelerate efforts to achieve educational equity for indigenous people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Contrary to those assurances, however, the simple fact remains that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are still the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. Clearly, what is needed is not just more money but a better and more effective way of directing and spending that money. Over the past five years under the AEP we have seen a pattern of assurances of equity in educational outcomes between Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people, yet fundamentally the position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people still remains significantly lower compared with non-Aboriginals.

         The more we look at the current figures the more depressing the picture becomes.

Almost half of those who left school wanted to, but felt they could not, go on to do further study or training.

         The ABS survey found an appallingly low level of access to secondary schools providing classes up to year 12, TAFE colleges and universities.

Fourteen per cent of those surveyed were over 100 kilometres from the nearest secondary school which provided classes up to year 10, 32 per cent were over 100 kilometres from the nearest secondary school providing classes up to year 12, 43 per cent were over 100 kilometres from the nearest TAFE and almost 81 per cent were over 100 kilometres from the nearest university.

         Rural education is yet another area where the government has disappointed not just Aboriginal Australians but non-Aboriginal Australians as well. The minister has called for an educational vision for rural Australia. I think the minister will agree that an educational vision is desperately needed for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in order to reverse the shameful statistics I gave earlier. What are clearly needed are benchmarks to determine the effectiveness of resource allocation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education.

         The minister has no choice but to acknowledge that continuing to allocate substantial sums for Aboriginal education is pointless unless there are accountability benchmarks which first and foremost determine whether the maximum benefit is derived by those they are designed to assist. I will say that again: unless there are accountability benchmarks which first and foremost determine whether the maximum benefit is derived by those they are designed to assist.

The opposition does not understand the role of its conservative ministers from around Australia who form part of MCEETYA. The opposition gives no acknowledgment of the poor performance of some state and territory governments in their constitutional responsibilities—that is, providing primary education, secondary education and preschool education to Aboriginal students around Australia.

         I will come to an example of that. The review that Minister Free spoke about involved quite a significant detailed study of education attainment levels for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people throughout Australia. One of the tables which they have produced shows retention rates to years 11 and 12 for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students from 1989 to 1993. What do we find out from this table? Contrary to what you have been led to believe by the opposition, the table says that there have been quite significant improvements in the educational achievement levels of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

         In 1989, the year 10 retention rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was 70.13 per cent. By 1993 that had increased to 78.5 per cent. The year 11 retention rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people went from 33.9 per cent to 52 per cent, and for year 12 it went from 14 per cent to 25.2 per cent. Clearly that is not good enough. But to have us believe, as the opposition would, that there has been no dramatic improvement in this area when the contrary is true is dishonest. The opposition should be acknowledging that we need to do a lot more, yes, but what we have been doing is, in a committed way, working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and state and territory governments to try to achieve better outcomes.

         This table is particularly illuminating. It says that for the Northern Territory, my constituency, the retention rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in years 10, 11 and 12 have declined. The only state or territory in Australia where there has been a dramatic reduction in the standards of achievement for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory has, of course, had a conservative government since self-government in 1978—that is, the CLP, the Country Liberal Party, the bedfellows of the opposition.

It tells us that in 1989 the year 10 retention rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was 61.38 per cent and by 1993 it had reduced to 41 per cent. That means that there had been almost a 33 per cent decrease in the achievement levels for year 10 students in the Northern Territory between 1989 and 1993 when the CLP had primary responsibility for the delivery of education services. For year 11 the figure dropped from 26.73 to 22.22. Significantly, for year 12 it dropped from 14.01 per cent to 10.32 per cent.

Therefore, 78 per cent of all students finished year 12. The number of Aboriginal students who finished year 12 was one in 10.

         Let us understand what that properly means. In the Northern Territory, for example, it means that there is no high school that can properly deliver mainstream high school services to any Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory. We need to understand that not one Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory has a high school that is capable of giving them up to year 10 or, more importantly, year 12 education. It is fine if you live in Darwin, Katherine, Alice Springs, Jabiru, Alyangula or Nhulunbuy, but it is not good if you are an Aboriginal student and you live in a remote community.

         What does that mean? It clearly means that there is severe educational disadvantage. That is identified. A lot needs to be said about it. Not only is that an abysmal performance in the Northern Territory but it is likely to get worse rather than improve. One of the reasons for that is the basic demographic reason: the Aboriginal population is increasing.

         In recent months I have visited a large number of Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. I have made a small study of what is happening to these children who would otherwise be in high schools if they lived in a mainstream community. Numbers of these children are going away to boarding school. One might think that is a very good idea—and it may well be because they do not have any other choice. This involves a direct payment by the Commonwealth government. The Commonwealth government pays for the purchase of those boarding facilities and those services. It provides the tuition allowances that these students require. These costs are met by the Commonwealth government, not by the state or territory governments.

         There are no high schools in these communities. In the limited number of cases where these children go away to school the Commonwealth government pays. At one particular community I asked the community leaders what number of children were being sent away to high school. I was told that the figure was about 30. I spoke to the school staff and I asked, `What proportion of those 30 children are in mainstream classes? How many of those children are actually achieving the academic results that you expect them to achieve when you send them away to school?' The figure is remarkable. The number of students in academic mainstream classes in the boarding school in Darwin was one.

He did not articulate anything that we do not know about the appalling state of Aboriginal education, generally speaking, and the need for us to do more. We all know that; it is acknowledged.

         The other important aspect which I do not think is properly understood is that, because Aboriginal students do not have the success rate as the broader community for a range of reasons—one of which is a failure to provide services in many cases—and because their population is increasing faster than the overall community, they are doubly disadvantaged. When they compete for jobs in an ever increasingly competitive labour market, they do not have the fundamental skills to get employment. Because we do not have high schools in remote communities in the Northern Territory, these young Aboriginal students who, if they had achieved year 10 successfully, otherwise might have had access to vocational training through a TAFE cannot do it. Why can't they do it? Because they have not successfully completed year 10 and they do not have the basic prerequisites to get into vocational training schemes offered by mainstream state and territory administrations through the TAFE system. They are denied access because they do not have the basic skills? Why do they not have the basic skills? Because the state and territory governments have failed to provide them.

         Not only are these Aboriginal students disadvantaged educationally; when they compete for a job in the labour market they are doubly disadvantaged. They find that they do not have the basic skills to compete in the broader labour market. Thankfully, there have been some improvements, about which I have already spoken. We are seeing the success rate of  Aboriginal students in higher education improving quite dramatically. We are seeing more Aboriginal students in the TAFE sector getting certificates where they have the initial competencies but, until we address this basic issue of providing all people in Australia, no matter where they live, with fundamental access to service provision, in the long term we will not be able to get a satisfactory outcome educationally, in terms of the labour market, vocational training or higher education. That requires commitment. It requires state and territory governments to work together.

The task force was established with a view to establishing a strategy for the long-term approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The task force concluded in 1988 and found, to nobody's surprise—especially not to Australia's indigenous people—that Aboriginal people were largely disadvantaged in educational opportunities. The task force called for the development of a national policy on Aboriginal education to achieve `broad equity between Aboriginal people and other Australians in access, participation and outcomes in all forms of education by the turn of the century'.

In one community I came to there was a lament that there was not an ability to learn in their own language. But in another community I was approached by the women of the community who asked me why the teacher at the school was teaching their children in their own language. Their point was that they spoke their own language at home, the children had no need to learn it at school and they wanted the children to learn English, which would give them a better capacity to get jobs when they left school.

The strategy aims to see schools create a greater awareness and better understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues. This strategy has several elements: the development of appropriate and consistent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander curriculum studies for all schools from preschool to year 12; the development of teacher education courses; and a grassroots campaign to promote greater understanding by students of their school's local Aboriginal community and its history.

It is very rare now to go into a school without finding that students are very much aware of the indigenous history of this nation. The national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's final report outlined comments from Aboriginal people regarding the program that gives effect to AESIP. Comments collected included a need for continuity and stability in funding, streamlined administration and accountability procedures and better ways to exercise self-determination in education. Every time you have a review there is the reiterated need for greater self-determination in education—there is always a problem.

         Education contributes directly to all people's quality of cultural, social and economic life. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, self-determination in education is essential. It creates the framework which allows indigenous Australians to develop, to be themselves and to be put on an equal footing with the rest of the nation. To make real progress we have to look at what has happened and why the system has not worked better. As I have said, part of the answer is always the same. Each time we conclude that we must let Aboriginal communities have a greater input, but we just seem to talk about it. We do not do anything about it.

         I note that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) in his statement referred to the factors which contribute to educational disadvantage for Aboriginal people. He said that education systems may not adequately accommodate students' cultural backgrounds. I suggest that in many cases they certainly do not. He said that people in remote communities can have limited access to quality education. I think `can have' again is hopeful. There is a definite problem there. Many indigenous children have special learning needs because English is not their first language. This is something that should have been corrected long ago. We agree with the comments on poverty limits, but there are many other aspects which he has not taken into account. There are transport, financial and social factors which I would like to refer to in a minute if I have the time.

         Australia's record is quite unacceptable. The participation rate of Aboriginal people is the lowest experienced by any group. Attendance rates are low and attrition and truancy rates are high. We have to look at the truancy rates and consider what are the cultural as well as the social determinations of those truancy rates. This comes back to the Aboriginal communities themselves who, in taking more responsibility for education, can look at some of these factors. Instead of trying to control them from above, we must control them from the grassroots level.

         Although Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have improved their standing in education over the last five years, the improvement has not been large enough. Behind the national indicators there are considerable variations between states and territories, but in all areas Aboriginal participation rates are below those of all other Australians. The member for the Northern Territory spent a long time criticising the Northern Territory government for its participation rates and school retention rates. While he was talking I looked at the statistics. Although I used somewhat different measures from the member, I did note that he said there were some disturbing trends in the Northern Territory.

         It is obviously unacceptable that from 1987 to 1992-93 there has been a considerable drop in numbers in those graduating from year 11 to year 12.

         When I was looking at these statistics, I also noted, as all the reviews have noted, that the big problem is the retention rate from one year to the next. For all Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, for instance, the retention rate from grade 8 to grade 9 is 90 per cent; from grade 9 to 10, 85 per cent; from grade 10 to 11, 62.7 per cent; and from grade 11 to 12, 64 per cent. Over that four-year period that represents a decrease from 90 per cent of children graduating down to 30 per cent still there in year 12, which is one of the problems we have.

         We have to ask why it is happening at that level. It is not taken into account by the minister in his explanation because that applies to all students. So why are we getting that huge drop over that period? One reason suggested to me by one Aboriginal community was that the students who wish to stay are placed under enormous pressure due to the fact that as their peers drop out they find themselves without a peer group. As that peer group was an extraordinarily strong peer group while they were in the lower grades, they had formed their bonds with this group. Similarly, the other students had formed their bonds and had not included Aboriginal students. So, when their numbers in the peer group started to decline, the students found themselves isolated. That, plus the peer pressure to leave school, led to a greater leaving rate in the higher grades. That is something that will have to be addressed by the school system.

         Aboriginal people have consistently called for a greater influence in the decision making process, not only of education but of all the parts that affect their life, whether it is health, work or anything else.

         It is interesting to note that in my state of Queensland we had a coalition government until 1989. I will relate to the parliament a little anecdote which illustrates the coalition's attitude to Aboriginal and Islander education policy. When the Hawke government was elected in 1983, Susan Ryan was the education minister. She went with my predecessor to the Torres Strait. So appalling were the conditions for Aboriginal and Islander education that she came straight back to Canberra and said to the Prime Minister that something had to be done about it. The government put in $10 million at the time to rebuild the schools in the Torres Strait. There was no contribution from the Queensland government. It did not care.

That school is basically what I describe it as: it is a tin shed with no fans. There is one building for what is one of the largest islands in the Torres Strait. The Hawke government put that money straight in. There are now excellent schools right throughout all the outer islands of the Torres Strait.

         But there is no doubt that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people face disadvantage in many aspects of life. Health is one area that is persistently mentioned. It is acknowledged that the gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and the health of the rest of the Australian population is enormous. The Commonwealth government is committed to addressing this problem. Apart from health, education is another area that can cause astounding disparity in circumstances, especially when the policy is not working. Commitment is not forthcoming from a reluctant government. That sounds very much like the coalition government in Queensland prior to 1989. The 1988 task force obviously emphasised that disadvantage.

         Around the 1950s and earlier there was an emphasis on assimilation in schooling. Mission schools, rightly or wrongly, were determined to instil an awareness of Christianity and a strict and traditional education.

         The 1970s saw a swing to the possibility of a culturally appropriate education. There has been criticism of what has been seen as the intrinsically racist nature of the European schooling system and the imposition of education policy on communities by government departments dominated by white men. Some academics considered whether any aspect of an education system that revolved around the classroom, the teacher-student relationship and with classes conducted in English was appropriate or relevant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. But this approach to education has also met with hostility from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parents. Denying Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the same access to schooling as non-Aboriginal students limits the options available to these children and restricts the opportunities for self-determination.

Attracting teachers to these areas is difficult and retaining them more so.

         —My question is to the Treasurer. Since the last election, in addition to stealing away the l-a-w income tax cuts, you have increased sales tax on every taxable item by two per cent, you have increased petrol excise by 7c and 5c a litre, you have increased sales tax on cars by five per cent and you have raised an additional $7 billion in indirect taxes. Yet, according to Access Economics, a person on average weekly earnings subject to the SGC is still paying more income tax than they were 10 years ago. Is this the kind of tax reform—singling out middle income earners for special punishment—that your government is proud of?

         Of course the OECD, in looking at taxes around the world and at tax regimes of various countries, does not include as tax contributions of this kind, which are paid to private funds, not to the government. Nor should they be included, because they are not paid to the government. The government is not receiving these amounts of money. They are not there for us to spend on whatever we want—social security or anything else. We do not get that money. How can it possibly be seen as tax? It is an absurdity. The OECD makes that clear distinction.

         —I do not know why they bothered asking the question. Obviously they are not interested in the answer. Anyway, I would just like to make this point at least. When the OECD did that analysis, it made it absolutely clear that payments of this kind not paid to the government were not taxes and therefore should not be seen as part of the tax burden of a country. The OECD did its analysis on the basis of what we all understand to be taxes—that is, payments made to the government, not payments made to private funds which invest the money on behalf of members and eventually pay benefits to those members.

         —Once one gets that out of the way, this whole Access Economics analysis absolutely collapses. What you have then is a situation where the supposed increase in the tax burden has disappeared. In fact, the tax burden is reduced—from 24 1/2 per cent of GDP in 1984-85 down to 23 per cent in 1994-95. That is a notably reduced tax burden as a proportion of GDP. In terms of individuals, the tax burden of 13 1/2 per cent in 1984-85 was down to 12 per cent in 1994-95. We are clearly looking at reduced tax burdens across the whole board and for individuals paying income tax. We should take no notice whatever of this absurd analysis. It is trying to raise a straw man. It should be seen for what it is and disregarded entirely.

         —I thank the member for Franklin for his question. It is certainly important to recall that 10 years ago to this day the now Prime Minister stood in this House and announced a series of changes to the income tax system which were very substantial indeed and gave Australia a tax system in which, for once, we could feel some pride. By any standards, that was a major set of reforms which has served this country exceedingly well.

         The background to this is that when this government came to power in 1983 we had a tax system which was in a state of near terminal decay. We recall that the previous government, with the now Leader of the Opposition as Treasurer for the last 5 1/4 years of its time in office, had simply refused to face up to the fundamental deficiencies of the tax system. It was replete with blatant tax avoidance and tax evasion schemes. Indeed, some of the most blatant, outrageous and criminal tax evasion schemes ever seen anywhere in the world were operating for years and years here in this country under the previous government. It was a tax system with gaping holes. For most high income earners, it had reached the stage where paying income tax was, essentially, optional.

         It was only when some of these schemes were plastered all over the front pages of the newspapers that we eventually got some action from the then government to redress some of the more outrageous elements. That still left a system that was blatantly inequitable and open to gross exploitation. So, on 19 September 1985, the then Treasurer under this government made his announcement about reforms to the income tax system which were designed to close off those gaping holes and restore decency, equity and efficiency to the tax system.

         I will briefly remind the House that the main elements were the taxation of fringe benefits, which previously were untaxed so you could simply receive income, essentially untaxed, by way of various forms of fringe benefits without paying any real tax, and that meant there was obvious scope for enormous avoidance of tax; the introduction of substantiation provisions, to require people to substantiate their claimed expenses; the taxation of foreign source income, which was basically untaxed—if there was any tax paid overseas, there was no further tax paid when it came to Australia; and the taxation of real capital gains. We previously had not had a capital gains tax, and this important way of receiving income without paying any tax was essentially closed off by this addition to the tax system. In addition to that, we made various changes to improve the equity of the system—cutting the marginal income tax rates.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is interesting to recall that under the now Leader of the Opposition, then the Treasurer, we had a top marginal tax rate of 60 per cent. It looked to be fair and reasonable, but not many people paid it because of all these loopholes. That top rate was cut from 60 per cent to 49 per cent and eventually to 47 per cent. The intermediate rate, which applied to average weekly earnings, was cut from 46 per cent to 40 per cent, and it is now down to 34 per cent. The bottom rate was reduced slightly; it had already been cut from 30 per cent to 25 per cent and it went down to 24 per cent. As well, we substantially increased the income tax threshold.

         With that, we had full imputation of company tax so that dividends were taxed only once instead of twice. The incentive to invest through equity in productive activity rather than to look for the most tax effective outcome was greatly increased. That has been a remarkably important change in the tax system to ensure that we have productive investment in this country instead of tax effective investment, which was what applied previously.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The company tax rate was also increased at that time to help pay for the cost of imputation, but it was later cut from 49 per cent to 36 per cent. The company tax rate is now 10 per cent less than it was when this government came into office. Ten years after that statement was made Australia unquestionably has a much more equitable, fair and efficient tax system. Without those changes, our tax system would be shot to pieces.

         Let me take the fringe benefits tax. In 1994-95, some $2.1 billion net came from that tax. Without it that $2.1 billion would not be raised and, with that loophole opened, there would be massive amounts of additional income going through. There would be an enormous loss of income which would be made up presumably by jacking up the rates for those pay-as-you-earn taxpayers higher and higher.

         It is also important to bear in mind, as I said in answer to the previous question, that there has been no increase in the tax burden in that time. In the 10 years, that tax burden went down from 24 1/2 per cent to 23 per cent. That is the 10-year analysis. The additional revenue raised by these measures has not been used to jack up the total tax take. There has been a reduction in that 10-year period. This year it is a little higher, but it is still less than it was in 1984-85. We have not increased the tax burden in that time through these measures. We remain a low taxed country—the second lowest taxed country in the OECD, amongst Western developed countries.

         We have absolutely established our credentials on tax. This government stands for fairness, decency and equity in the tax system. We have cleaned up the terrible mess that was left by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer. We have a decent, equitable and fair tax system, and the tax burden in Australia remains the second lowest in the Western world. The people of Australia are benefiting from a much fairer system and no increase in the tax burden.

         —I concede that Senator Crichton-Browne is no longer a member of the Liberal Party, but he was at the time when the discussions took place. He indicated that there was a discussion held between the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Court and himself. He did not expand on exactly what those discussions were or their content. He was not prepared to say exactly what had been discussed. But denials that have been made by the Leader of the Opposition and Mr Court about those discussions need to be refuted in this parliament. Senator Crichton-Browne was more forthcoming in discussions with the

        So Senator Crichton-Browne told you to keep your mouth shut and stay out of it, but you did not take his advice on that as on other matters. Having had a cosy little chat about it and obviously seeing the political advantage in turning up the heat on the Labor Party, as the opposition saw it, Senator Crichton-Browne says this about the outcome:

         —I am sure members will be aware that the United Nations first world conference has just concluded on a platform that clearly promotes women's rights both domestically and internationally. I would like to take the opportunity today to thank a number of people, including Ms Kathy Townsend, head of the Office of the Status of Women, who did a tremendous job with the delegation which included a significant number of senior public servants and parliamentarians. I would like, too, to take the opportunity to thank our ambassador in Beijing, Mike Lightowler, who did a splendid job not only in supporting the delegation but in protecting some of our citizens—something that was, it is sad to say, necessary at the time.

          The non-government organisations who took part were very active and participated well. Indeed, they took the lead in a lot of key areas. My parliamentary colleagues, including the member for Pearce, also supported the delegation well.

         I think it needs to be understood that a platform is not legally binding but it does provide internationally agreed benchmarks to measure how well countries are advancing the status of women, and that includes Australia. It clearly consolidates gains from previous conferences and goes further in some areas. The test for all of us now will be to see how well these commitments are implemented.

         The issues which are clearly of concern to women around the world are principally violence against women in all its forms and the lack of women in public life and decision making positions. I am sure members will remember that these were two areas of concern to Australian women which we have given priority to addressing. The conference actually moved further than previous conferences on key issues such as measuring unpaid work, promoting the education of women and girls, identifying ways to phase out child labour and early marriage and, of course, eliminating violence against women. It also achieved a considerable degree of consensus on greater protection for women against rape and war crimes.

         Both India and China ultimately had no reservations to the platform of action, which means that by far the majority of the world's women can potentially be covered by the platform. Australia, as I am sure members will know, was instrumental in initiating the conference of commitments proposal and some 65 countries embraced Australia's idea of making very firm commitments. Again I would like to thank all those people involved for a conference which, from Australia's point of view, was a very considerable success.

I appreciate that you have ruled that it is a convention which we are to disregard for these purposes, but that is my first point of order. My second point of order concerns standing order 145. The minister has twice been asked a very simple question—a quite specific question. She has made it quite clear that she has no intentions whatsoever of answering the question. Under those circumstances, from any reading of the standing orders, there is no way an objective, reasonable person could say that her answer is relevant to the question. Under those circumstances, you should rule her out of order.

         Mr Speaker, if members opposite are interested in inconsistencies, I draw one to your attention that has occurred today in the commission itself. Mr Court said very clearly to the commission today that he heard about the fact that he had been cleared of the allegations in the petition some time between four and seven o'clock on the day the petition was tabled from an unknown, unnamed staffer. That is what he told the royal commission today. What he told the parliament on Tuesday, 10 November, in Western Australia, was this:

That program is now well under way and will have, as its cornerstone, the establishment of specific legal services for women in each of the Australian states and will see a substantial upgrading of the existing services which operate in the three major eastern states in the establishment of new services in Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and the ACT. There will also be a new service established in the Northern Territory and in North Queensland. The core of the services provided by these centres will include the provision of telephone advice networks operating on a 008 number, and will provide specific litigation services, case work and advice programs for women.

         Importantly, the Law Reform Commission also recognised—as had a number of other major reports, including, I think, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody—the need for there to be services directed at Aboriginal and Islander women. It was noted that particular services operated by legal aid commissions and, more specifically, Aboriginal legal services did not adequately cater for the needs of Aboriginal women. The government has accepted these recommendations and, as part of the justice program, outreach services will be attached either to the specialist women's services or to existing community legal services, depending on the most appropriate location, in order to extend those outreach services so that Aboriginal women also have provision to have their needs met.

         This, together with a range of other reforms to the substantive law, such as changes to the Corporations Law allowing small businesses and one-company directors to overcome the difficulty often identified of bringing unknowing spouses—in terms of the operation of a business—into a company, and improving the operation of the Family Law Act, as well as a number of other substantive law reforms, will mean that the government has put together a most comprehensive strategy to address the particular needs of accessing justice for Australian women.

         The Trade Practices Commission has written to the Western Australian branch of the AMA warning it that it may be encouraging a breach of the Trade Practices Act. This follows a meeting which the AMA organised urging doctors not to enter into competitive arrangements. In practice, the AMA is encouraging doctors to get together and agree only to supply their services to health insurance companies under certain terms. It is this behaviour that the TPC and the government are concerned about. It is not tolerated in any other sector of the economy and it is not acceptable in the health system either.

         I am surprised that the medical profession is only just coming to terms with what the Trade Practices Act requires of it. It has been in existence for 20 years.

A number of cases have been taken since and I understand that in every case the doctors have had to back down.

         The AMA has shown that it is out of touch with the standards of business behaviour accepted elsewhere in the community. Even the legal profession is making an effort to comply with the Trade Practices Act and this has involved a major rethink of its practices. State governments have also been reviewing their legislation as it applies to lawyers to remove anti-competitive practices. But this action by the doctors is revealing a very disturbing picture of how they view their rights and responsibilities as a profession. I quote a recent comment by members of the AMA Council:

        The Trade Practices Act is there to ensure that the new market being created for doctors and the health insurance companies remains competitive and fair.

In the absence of a fringe benefits tax, it would be completely untaxed. These cash management trusts can be dissolved at any time and converted into cash.

In other words, we would go back to the system that the Leader of the Opposition was quite happy to preside over for all the 5 1/4 years that he was Treasurer under the Fraser government.

         —I thank that member from the National Party for his interjection. I can understand his excitement, because the stupidity of the National Party's resolution is being exposed. It is the Liberal Party's proposal, as I was saying, to in some way amend the fringe benefits tax system and punch some holes in that tax. They will have the opportunity even tomorrow to start to do that, if they want, when a bill on the FBT comes before the House. If they want to give effect to their resolution, the National Party can start to take some action tomorrow. We will see whether they really do believe what they passed as their resolution.

         The tax raises, at the moment, $2.1 billion. As I said before, that is $2.1 billion that we would not get without this tax. But if we did not have it, there would be massive amounts of other income loss going through the fringe benefits loophole. To take it away or to punch holes in it is the most extraordinarily obtuse and stupid policy for an opposition or any party in this country to have. It goes over well when you are talking to business groups, but it is stupid tax policy. It goes back to the kind of system which the opposition followed when they were in government last time. What they are really saying is, `Elect us and we will go back to the sort of system that applied under John Howard when he was Treasurer last time.' That will mean loopholes and tax inequity everywhere. That is the kind of system they will have.

         It is not just confined to the FBT. We see exactly the same sort of thing in terms of the concessions that are being talked about all over the place by the honourable member for Pearce, who represents the opposition on small business, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Goldstein and probably various others. They are going around the country with nods and winks about what they will do for people in terms of the capital gains tax. They will ease the burden of capital gains tax on small business or some other section of business. Again, the same principle applies.

         The capital gains tax is all about tax equity. If you do not tax it, then income will go through as capital gains without any tax being paid. Is anyone saying that is really a fair system? If the opposition thinks that it is fair, then stand up and say so. The whole history of this country shows that it is tax stupid not to have a capital gains tax. Most countries in the Western world have one precisely because not to have one means that you have a wide open avenue for avoidance of taxation as well as for loss of equity in the system.

         What we have from this opposition increasingly is evidence that they would in government be the kind of government that they were last time—a government that allowed the tax system to corrode away, that allowed all the loopholes to be exploited and that allowed the system to be punched open by not having the blockers of things like fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax—and that they would allow this tax system to come into massive disrepute, the way they did shockingly in the period up until 1983.

Let me enumerate the federal interests in any particular area of local government. Fifty per cent of their funds, of course, come from the federal government. If there is substantial misspending of those resources, then that would be a matter of interest to us. Last time I looked, too, as far as the taxation act was concerned, proceeds from bribery were still subject to taxation. That would also be a matter of some interest as far as the federal government is concerned.

         I also made it absolutely clear in the remarks that I made that those remarks should not be regarded as foreshadowing an intention by the federal government to necessarily go down this road at all. What those remarks went to was the absolute necessity for Richard Court to establish a proper inquiry into the affairs of Wanneroo—a view that I know you share since you are, in fact, associated with a petition to secure precisely that.

         Indeed, Richard Court's situation is made more difficult by his Deputy Premier who indicated during the course of the last week on precisely this matter, `How could you possibly on those insubstantial things, with which I disagreed at the time, conduct a royal commission on the affairs that the minister for health has been targeted with by Richard Court and not hold one on Wanneroo?' A very good point by the Deputy Premier, I thought. `How could you possibly go down that road,' said the Deputy Premier and National Party leader in Western Australia, `a road, Richard, incidentally, which I told you not to go down as you would be simply looking malicious and looking as though you were targeting a person politically and then find yourself where you, front and centre, have precisely the sorts of things that royal commissions are called into, and then fail to call a royal commission into that?'

         Indeed, I noticed that Hendy Cowan's views on that were echoed today by a National Party member of the Legislative Assembly. As I understand it, his views had been echoed earlier in the week by two former Liberals who are now members of the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia. I understand that Mr Pendal is in the process of calling for a royal commission or some other form of inquiry like a royal commission into the affairs of Wanneroo Inc. And well he might. There was some inquiry put in place into those affairs by the Lawrence government under the auspices of Peter Kyle, who I understand is a card carrying member of the Liberal Party. Mr Kyle got himself into this situation: he was unable to have Dr Wayne Bradshaw interviewed for that inquiry. As I understand it, Dr Wayne Bradshaw, a former prominent Liberal and one of your antagonists, has since gone to gaol. The Kyle report found this:

        Since then, Mr Court has had some secret inquiry into the affairs of, more specifically, Liberal MLA Wayde Smith. Liberal MLA Wayde Smith was invited to explain himself to a secret inquiry as to how, as an officer on a salary of $35,000, he was able to service loans in excess of $1 million for a considerable period of time. I understand that that particular inquiry exonerated Mr Smith, though the reasons for that were never in fact tabled by the Premier—and we are not privy to reasons why that was the case.

Without any question, it should be organised by the state government and/or the state parliament. That is precisely what ought to proceed.

         As the minister who is responsible for the finances of the Commonwealth and responsible for seeing those funds doled out, I naturally have a federal interest in making absolutely certain that Richard Court does go through the process of establishing a royal commission into the affairs of Wanneroo. I am delighted to be in such eminent conservative company across the board in that conviction, and I note also in recent times in the eminent conservative company of yourself as far as those affairs are concerned.

         I conclude with Hendy Cowan again: how could you possibly set up a rort like that associated with this inquiry into the situation of a minister for health in which you purely politically target someone for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with corrupt behaviour, absolutely nothing to do with maladministration and, now we know from the royal commissioner, absolutely nothing to do with misleading parliament, absolutely nothing to do with the differential remembrances of cabinet meetings? It has everything to do apparently with whether or not the then Premier would have placed herself in contempt of parliament by interfering with a petition that we now know was drafted solely by the Legislative Council clerk, solely on the advice of Mr Easton and Mr Howard, and solely presented to Mr Easton and Mr Howard—facts now known by Mr Hendy Cowan obviously as reasons for deprecating the notion that there ought to have been a royal commission organised into that.

         How could you possibly do that and then sit in the front and centre of the responsibility of the administration of justice in Western Australia—two councillors convicted of corruption, a whole cloud hanging over the affairs of the branches of that area—and not have a royal commission on that? I do not think that it is necessary to expend Commonwealth funds on going down that course. But, as a Commonwealth minister who is at the end of the day responsible for the funds that do half the business of the city of Wanneroo, I sure as heck would like to see young Richard do it.

The first point I should make is that the government does accept that indigenous art does require additional protection above that which applies generally for those involved in creative enterprise. We have regarded this for some time as an area for priority attention and in the Creative Nation statement the Prime Minister acknowledged that reconciliation with Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples required also additional protection for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture.

         That is not to say that the existing law does not already provide some degree of protection. The Copyright Act does provide for contemporary Aboriginal artists a degree of protection. A couple of recent cases in the Federal Court illustrate that. The Aboriginal carpets case was an example. Some contemporary Aboriginal design was applied to carpets which were for sale, in breach of the copyright of the Aboriginal makers of those designs. The Federal Court action was successful.

         There is a range of measures available to Aboriginal artists already but the principal shortfall of that range of remedies is that they do not really recognise the specific traditional background for much of Aboriginal art. They certainly do not go to art which is part of a historical ownership of an Aboriginal group—rock art or totemic art, for example. That kind of design, outside the life of the artist plus 50 years, which is the copyright protection period, is at large under the copyright regime and can be misused—and frequently has been. In addition, there are problems with collective ownership of design, or community ownership, which is the frequent pattern of Aboriginal cultural expression. There are also difficulties with cultural activities which are not fixed by recording on paper or canvas—works of art such as dance and the like.

I refer the minister to her demonstrated expertise in the academic disciplines of memory loss and statistics. What is the statistical probability that seven former cabinet ministers would all suffer collective amnesia of an event and, moreover, that they would all suffer the terrible affliction of a collective fantasy in which they imagined detailed recollections of dates, conversations and a course of events?

         —I have just been reminded of a fairly improbable failure of recollection by the member who has just asked the question. Apparently, when he was accused of giving a speech to the League of Rights, he first claimed that it was a Christian organisation and that he had not really realised that it was the League of Rights he was speaking to. He changed his view under pressure. Members behind me have also reminded me of the member's signal failure, which was the beginning of his decline which now sees him sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition, when he did not know what the state of play was in relation to the opposition's policy on land rights in the Northern Territory. The opposition leader himself in recent times has been unclear about whether he had discussions with Richard Court or the member for Chisholm. He was prepared to forgive the member for O'Connor because, after all, it was some time ago that matters that he had frankly lied about were drawn to the public's attention.

         Mr Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, has said on a number of occasions that he does not think voters expect the truth during election campaigns. So, when we have questions here about remembering and truth-telling, I hope that members opposite will examine their own performance very closely. I hope, too, that they will examine the performance of one of their favoured sons in Western Australia very closely. I mentioned earlier a current failure of recollection by the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, about when it was that he was told that he had been exonerated in relation to police investigations.

If not, I will ask my colleagues at the consumer ministers council to review their decision of 9 May this year which allowed for the extension of the date of implementation. I remain absolutely confident that those two states will join all the other states and territories and have this legislation passed in time and therefore give consumers the uniform credit legislation which they have been waiting for for so long.

        That is the rule. But in the letter it goes on to say that in future only photographs taken from the front of the person addressing the dispatch box or the parliament should be taken.

         is the fact that the Minister for Human Services and Health is on her feet answering a question from the opposition.

If so, why hasn't there been a complaint in respect of other photographs? I have not conducted an intensive search, but some photographs have been supplied to me. I believe that a lot of photographs which would be in breach of today's ruling have been allowed to go through in the last 12 months.

         —I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. In July the state member for Manly in the New South Wales parliament collected signatures on a petition addressed to you, as Speaker of the House of Representatives, protesting against the Telstra mobile phone base station at Harbord kindergarten. Dr Macdonald sent the original, signed by 528 people, to the Minister for Communications and the Arts on 21 July, and he sent a photocopy to me. As of yesterday, the minister had not lodged the original with the Bills and Papers Office for tabling, nor had he returned the original to the state member for Manly. In the light of the Prime Minister's comment yesterday that not tabling a petition is possibly a contempt of parliament, I ask: would you facilitate in this case the tabling of a photocopy by me? I am certainly prepared to do it, and the Minister for Communications and the Arts plainly is not.

We heard the Prime Minister say yesterday that not to table a petition is a contempt of parliament. The minister is refusing to table the petition. I am asking whether it would be possible for you to allow me to table the petition, because I am very happy to do so. If the minister will not hand over the original, may I table a photocopy?

         —My question is directed to you, Mr Speaker, and it is in two parts. The first is in relation to the use of these microphones. Once today and once yesterday I noticed that when opposition people rose to speak the microphones were not turned on; I could not hear them. That was in the case of the member for Warringah yesterday, and in the case of the member who just spoke, the member for Kennedy. I have also noticed from time to time that when the Prime Minister rises to speak when it is not his turn that the microphones are immediately turned on. I would like some sort of ruling from you as to what are the rules about the technicians turning on the microphones, because I think it is important that we have a fair use of the microphones and that it is not a matter for technicians to make a decision as to how you might or might not rule on a matter.

         The second part of my question is this: I notice that you made a member of the opposition withdraw a comment when he drew a comparison between you and your predecessor, Mr McLeay. I would like to know if you have interpreted that any comparison between you and Mr McLeay is to be considered odious and therefore may not be made.

          In respect of the first issue about microphones, the person that has the call from the chair has only that microphone turned on. The only other microphone which is always active in this place in fact is the microphone that relates to the chair. In respect of the inference regarding the Prime Minister's microphone, I do not think that is correct; in fact, I know that is not correct. Even if he does stand from time to time, which I accept he is prone to do, that microphone is not turned on because I know the difference from here to there when microphones are on. It is only the microphone of the member with the call and this microphone at the chair which are live.

         —It is a tragedy that in the last decades of the 20th century, Australia, which is potentially one of the world's richest societies, has become more unequal. It is a disgrace that this growth in inequality has been presided over by the longest serving federal Labor government in Australia's history. It is a scandal that Labor has tried to deny, disguise and divert from this reality.

         Through decades of rhetoric in opposition and years of propaganda in government, Labor has tried to build a myth about being the standard-bearer of progress and equality. The reality is that the Hawke-Keating government has not been the party of social progress. It has been the party of regression. It has been the party that has made the least well off, worse off.

         Labor cannot admit this, because it would then be very hard to masquerade as the inheritors of Chifley and Curtin; to mouth the platitudes of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about the true believers, about social justice and about inclusiveness; to drip venom about the so-called straighteners. It would be very hard if Labor admitted the truth that under their governance the poor have been made poorer.

         Earlier this year, EPAC produced new statistics on earnings at the behest of the Prime Minister. These showed that in 1994 the lowest paid earners earned less in real terms than in 1983. In fact, they earned more in 1983 than in any of the Hawke-Keating years, bar one. Over the same period, the earnings of the highest paid workers increased by almost 20 per cent. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has delicately described this as `some increase in earnings disparities'. You have to give him something; he has a certain Sir Humphrey way with words.

         In fairness, it has to be said that statistics are one dimensional. If we want to vividly understand what the Labor Party has done to this society we have to look at the landmark study by Bob Gregory and Boyd Hunter, which shows how our society is changing for the worse. It shows a society in which `income distribution has become more unequal and the change is extraordinary'; a society in which `there is a significant increase in the geographical polarisation of household income'; a society in which `the poor are increasingly living together in one set of neighbourhoods and the rich in another set'; a society in which `the economic gap is widening'.

         How does Labor respond to this devastating picture? It is simple: Labor denies that it exists; it has not happened, it is a mirage. It is a mirage caused by—once again we hear the minister's delicate phrase—`compositional change in the bottom one per cent of areas'. What Labor is saying essentially is that its policy of targeting public housing concentrates the poor in some neighbourhoods. So the poor are not really getting poorer; they just look as if they are getting poorer. Leaving aside the public policy implications—by deliberate act of policy—of congregating the poor in a limited set of neighbourhoods, and leaving aside the pathologies that this is likely to create, the fact is that Labor's myth is not true.

In short and in truth, given what real people earn in the real world, Labor's claims about the social wage are a sham.

         Just in case Labor thinks it can still wrap some shreds of its tattered egalitarian myth around itself, let me tell you about education and the working class. Education has always been a classic mode of mobility in this society. Through the 1960s and 1970s there was a movement towards increased equality of access to tertiary education by children from the least well-off families. The Hawke-Keating government reversed this. The regression is tracked in a study by the Australian Council for Educational Research on the transition to higher education of students completing year 12. In 1980, under Malcolm Fraser, 48 per cent of students from the least affluent quarter of the population entered higher education. In 1989, that proportion had fallen to 35 per cent.

One of the most fundamental planks of the Liberal Party's policy that they took into the last election and which they have to take into the next election—otherwise they cannot honour any of their other promises—is that they will slash massively government expenditure on programs such as those in the areas of social security, health and education.

The shadow Treasurer, the honourable  member  for  Higgins  (Mr Costello), has indicated that he wants to implement severe corrective measures to fiscal policy. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has committed himself to significant public savings. So far the only other definite statements that we have had on these issues are that certain areas of government expenditure will be quarantined. The opposition has outlined defence and the fact that it will increase spending to the states. That accounts for 21 per cent of federal government outlays. It is also clear that public debt interest is worth another eight per cent, so about 30 per cent of federal government outlays will be quarantined from any cuts.

So it is not valid to say that there has been this fall in income of those people when he has ignored the considerable mobility that occurs in Australian society both in the physical sense of house movement and in an income sense which has very definitely occurred.

So the amount of income coming into a household changed, because over a 15-year period in those census collector districts people moved out, the numbers of income earners changed and the income distribution in that household changed. People moved out, children grew up and moved house and people changed from being workers to retirees. You failed to take account of any of those changes in those family situations within those households. That is a very strong weakness in the Gregory study, which he admits.

         Thirdly, the study failed to analyse—and the member for Kooyong made this point but then discarded it as irrelevant—the fact that Commonwealth and state government public housing policy has deliberately targeted the lowest income earners. We have been making sure that our public housing stock has been targeted to those on the lowest income with the greatest need.

          So, of course, those suburbs which have high proportions of public housing have changed considerably over the last 15 years because we have been targeting the lowest income people to move into those public housing stocks, which was not the policy prior to the election of the Labor government.

We do not doubt that; we do not question it. That is one of the clear findings of Bob Gregory's study that we accept. In fact, we accept it so much that this government committed itself to a $5 billion program last year and over the next three years to significantly tackle unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, because that is going to be the best way we can alleviate poverty in those poorest suburbs.

That is why we on this side of the House believe that the claims made by the opposition in this matter are hypocritical in the extreme, because the evidence is there from the last time they were in government. When they had the reins of Treasury, the income gap between the poorest and the wealthiest increased dramatically. They slashed all social security payments so that people like old age pensioners' standard of living collapsed.

         I would like the honourable member for Moreton to stay and listen as I develop the point of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) about the need to address the parlous state of people in rural Australia. Let me develop that argument, because the diverging gap between the rich and poor is no better epitomised than when we consider the plight of rural Australians. It no better epitomises the government's failure to address the question of inequality. The appalling divergence in wealth is dramatic when comparing rural Australians with urban Australians.

         If the Prime Minister and any of his ministers of government expect to have any credibility with the people in rural and regional Australia, my advice would be that the Prime Minister launch his election campaign with a series of apologies to, in particular, the people in rural Australia and certainly those who are caught in this inequality trap for offending them with neglect. He can start by apologising to all the bankrupted small businesses who did not survive the decade of unprecedented high interest rates which he presided over as Treasurer. He could apologise to all those people consequently unemployed who contribute to the abominably high rural unemployment rate. He can apologise to all those families who miss out on Austudy because of the iniquitous assets test. He can apologise to all those drought stricken farmers who do not qualify for any aid because of the iniquitous criteria which they are expected to meet to be eligible for it. We are talking about equity and wealth sharing.

Who of those families caught in this trap will forget the infamous l-a-w promises he failed to meet in respect of taxation cuts? He had most certainly better apologise very smartly for the offensive remarks he made on 11 May this year when he said, `This is as good as it gets. It will never get any better.' That is not a lot of encouragement to those mum and dad businesses that are struggling to pay their bills and keep people in employment.

It is incomprehensible that the government has allowed a gap to be created between rural and urban Australia to the shocking extent that it has over the last decade. We have created a lower rural class. People of dignity and determined spirit are reduced to living cap in hand and being dependent on government handouts to survive.

         —I am sorry—the party that you have when you are not in the chair. In the years that Kennett has been in government, 35,000 public servants and hundreds of school teachers have been sacked. All the schools have been sold. Prince Henry's hospital down there was blown up so that they could build a townhouse—they did not just pull it down, they blew it up to get it out in a hurry. The state government has sold off all the assets. It is running down the whole infrastructure of Victoria.

         If we have a look at some of the actual facts—not statistics—we see that these things are happening in Victoria to real people. These are the sorts of things that should be mentioned. This is a case study of a man with Down syndrome. He was living in a health and community services residential unit in Dandenong and was transferred to a nursing home due to his restlessness at night. The man has minimal personal support needs and cried after being hurt by another resident of the nursing home with dementia. The staff of the nursing home felt that this man should not be there.

         The Kennett government has transferred people with intellectual disabilities into nursing homes in order to place them under the Commonwealth system. So we are actually paying for it. It is estimated that this has happened in over 700 cases in Victoria. The state government is shifting the blame and creating inequality not just between rich and poor but between people with all sorts of disabilities. It is putting those people in places that are not really correct for them.

         There is also a case in my electorate of a pensioner who has had her electricity cut off. When she went to pay, she was told that she had to pay a $140 reconnection fee up-front. She paid it. She then could not pay the initial electricity bill of $50, so her electricity was cut off again. She now has to pay another $140.

         These sorts of policies, which are being implemented by people like those opposite, create inequality in our community. One only has to look as what is happening at the Frankston council, which has three commissars who are getting $60,000 a year. They are all paid-up members of the Liberal Party. I think they are all retired and are fairly wealthy business people. They receive in their pocket whatever they get in their pension, plus $60,000, plus phone, plus a car.

         What is that doing? It is creating a huge disparity because the low income people of Victoria have to pay an extra $2,000 in taxes. We also have to pay a $100 poll tax, a home tax—which Jeffrey has just removed because there could be an election in the air. He will reintroduce it if he ever gets back in again. However, while the people of Victoria have got taxes and charges of $2,000, we have got people in the Liberal Party getting more money. What does that mean? It means that the rich are getting richer while the poor are poorer. Of course there is inequality.

         If you get your academic mates to have a real good look at those figures and do all these statistics, they will find that the biggest disparities are in Victoria because of all the consultants—who are friends and members of the Liberal Party—getting paid-up jobs, such as chairmanships of boards. In Victoria they amalgamated all our hospitals, sacked all the community representatives on the hospital boards and put people on them who are being paid $300,000 a year. Is that creating a disparity? Is that creating inequality? While the Liberals in Victoria are taxing the lowest people in our community by putting $2,000 in taxes on them, they are giving consultancies and contracts with councils and with the state government to their mates. Even people in this House have actually got contracts from the Victorian government.

         This sort of thing is going on all the time with members of the Liberal Party opposite. That is one of the reasons why we are creating this inequality. Because your policies are being enacted in Victoria, they are the sorts of policies you will implement here in government. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. You hit us poor people.

         —In continuing my speech on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill, I must say that the issues I raised earlier which are facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students are being addressed nationally through the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. I congratulate those members of the national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, in particular the chair, Mandawuy Yunupingu, and the deputy chair, Romina Fujii. Romina resides on Thursday Island. He is a constituent of mine and has spent his lifetime dedicated to the education of Torres Strait Islander people.

         There are a lot of outside aspects as well that must be taken into account in the education process. There is very little motivation for anyone to attend school if there is no reason for attending and no jobs at the end of it. That is where strategies such as the Working Nation paper can work in schools to develop regional employment policies, identify skill shortfalls and tackle tertiary education needs.

         The government has addressed this issue by allowing labour market programs into CDEP communities, which was previously prohibited. I congratulate the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), who spoke earlier in the debate, on his work as parliamentary secretary. He has fought long and hard for this. It is something on which a lot of people have called for him to be congratulated.

         Health is another important aspect of the education process. Children who are not well will not learn well. The federal government is tackling many of these issues and, in some cases, the states are playing their part. There is obviously a lot further to go but the commitment is there at the Commonwealth level.

         The Queensland government, I am pleased to say, has some innovative projects—I have mentioned Aurukun. Queensland has moved towards a community development approach. Consultation and making programs relevant to particular community needs have become a goal. Simple things such as the need for culturally appropriate discipline and community participation in schooling are being addressed. In my electorate, in particular, the community of Kowanyama has a community justice project in which the schools are playing a vital part. Aboriginal people are also being given responsibility and involvement in the education process as teachers and in the management of schools. The initiative of the ASPA committees comes to mind here.

         All these aspects are moves in the right direction. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can meet their aspirations, retain their cultural heritage and grasp self-determination with an educational process that takes the time to involve them. It is important to remember that the cultural aspect of the reference group in the report is important. I do not have time now to go into the recommendations but I think anyone who has any contact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities will recognise the importance that they attribute to cultural education.

         I was very pleased to have the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visit my electorate last week. It was a historic visit—the first time that a Prime Minister has visited Thursday Island and certainly the second time a Prime Minister has visited the Torres Strait. It was very pleasing to see the reaction of the school children. They recognise the contribution to education in the Torres Strait that has been made by the Labor government.

         I was particularly pleased to hear an address by the captain of the Thursday Island high school, Miss Bakoi Bon, who gave a very eloquent and considered address. It showed how the education process is working in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. She gave a very eloquent address, an address that could match, I would say, any school in the nation. It makes me very proud to see Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal children perform at such a level. It is difficult for anyone to speak in front of the Prime Minister, and that was a great performance.

         Despite the doomsayers in the opposition, there are improvements that are being made. We have a long way to go because of all the disadvantages that have been stated. The main job lies with the states, and that is what members of the coalition have conveniently forgotten in their addresses to the parliament. I hope they take this report back to their coalition colleagues, especially those in state government, along with the comments they have made here and say, `This is a good report. Let's implement it Australia-wide.'

         —The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), who has just spoken on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill, referred in his speech to Thursday Island, Kowanyama and Aurukun before he was interrupted by question time. I have visited those places and in fact many other communities around the country. Whilst obviously there have been some improvements in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education in some respects over the last few years, there is no question that, by any objective assessment, one would have to say it has not been sufficient and certainly has not been fast enough. The measures that the government has put into place have certainly not been as effective as it would have liked or as effective as they should have been.

         It is also important to recognise at the beginning of any debate on this particular issue the important role of the states. The member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) made great play about the states earlier in this debate. There is no question that the role of the states is an important factor in the delivery of any services. Speaking as a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, I would have to say that one of our strategic goals in the next three years of the council's operation is to very much focus on the role of states in delivering those services. Without proper delivery of those services by state governments of all persuasions, we will never be successful in addressing these very serious concerns in what is by any yardstick the most disadvantaged section of our community.

         It is interesting, as an aside, that the state government that tends to get criticised the most these days happens to be the Goss government. I will not go into that at this stage. Overall, we do need to see a national energy and will to solve the problems. It seems to me that all too often people are prepared to stand here and talk about the good intentions of programs without looking at the outcomes and without being prepared to recognise that there is a need to change some of the ways money is spent and programs are implemented and without being prepared to look to do that quickly and effectively.

         The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill will fund extra educational measures for indigenous Australians. It is all about the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, known as the AESIP. It is about Aboriginal education policy. It has got a number of worthy objectives. It has got several national priorities, and it is particularly concentrating on implementing recommendations from the deaths in custody royal commission. It is talking about Aboriginal literacy and reconciliation and the schooling strategy.

         All of those measures are worthy, necessary and supportable.

There is contained within the bill a minor adjustment in terms of the National Institute for Indigenous Performing Arts Training, and if I have time I might talk about that a little later on. But the main thrust is to provide extra money for Aboriginal education.

         I would like to look at how the government has performed over the last few years in this area. This is not just coalition rhetoric, which we are so often accused of by the other side. I would like to quote from an objective report to put in perspective the nature of the problem as it stands today in Australia in respect of our indigenous population. Unless people understand the nature of the problems and the current situation, we are not going to be effective in introducing new programs and spending money.

         I want to talk a bit about a report that came out of the University of Melbourne—in July of this year, so it is a very current report. It is headed `Educational outcomes survey: Aboriginal students in secondary schools—a preliminary analysis of learning outcomes and student perceptions of schooling'. This covers a number of different areas. The researchers have surveyed a whole range of schools across a wide range of areas. I want to quote from the introduction. It says:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        How well do Aboriginal students fare in Australian secondary schools? How do their outcomes compare with those for other students . . . Aboriginal students, who complete school less often than others, are less well represented in the most institutionally valued subjects and are more likely to fail insofar as they are represented. Their attainment in senior secondary English is weaker, a pattern foreshadowed by reported greater coping difficulties in Year 10. While Aboriginal students study vocational subjects more frequently than non-Aboriginal students, the reverse is true of the more esteemed vocational options like accountancy.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Aboriginal students appear to have lowered expectations of school and their perceptions of the success of their schools in meeting their needs are also lower. Boys in particular have poorer relations with teachers and are less well integrated in school.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While these findings require fuller investigation, they reveal disadvantages which are specific to or which are experienced with greater intensity by Aboriginal students. The data are sufficiently sophisticated to display differences between sub-groups within the Aboriginal population. Policy initiatives in Aboriginal education should not always assume that Aboriginal students are a homogeneous social group. Differences in  the educational experiences of boys and girls and students in rural areas are of particular interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        Behind those general statements there are a number of statistical facts, and graphs and charts which obviously one is not able to display in this chamber. I would like to comment on some of the more detailed findings of this report. For example, in looking at enrolment rates in mathematics and physical sciences in year 11, staying at school, whilst an important measure itself, needs to be supplemented by information on subject choice. Mathematics and physical sciences are a major area of interest because of their links with university. There is also evidence that students taking these subjects have a more positive experience of school than those who are not taking them. Consequently, we need to measure relative levels of access to them. Aboriginal students reaching year 11 are significantly less likely than other students to study chemistry or physics, and they are also less likely to study any form of maths, including university preparatory mathematics.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I will talk a bit about English and not just mathematics and the sciences. While English itself is not regarded as a `high stakes' subject, achievement in English has implications for performance in other subjects, including maths. The English curriculum is a major vehicle for cultural development as well as for mastery of communication. Attainment differences are therefore of great concern. Over 60 per cent of Aboriginal students in the sample that was assessed in this report were in the lowest two bands of performance, and this was nearly double the rate for non-Aboriginal students.

         One might be tempted to say that all this is not really new information and that we have known about it for many years. But what is concerning is that this is information that has come to light this year—1995—after several years of the programs that this government has been putting forward. What I think it is demonstrating is that what the government is doing is not working.

         For example, let us look at relative outcomes for students' performance in year 12 English in rural and provincial cities. Amongst Aboriginal students, which groups are achieving least well in English? Rural and provincial city students are more likely than their urban counterparts to do poorly. Nearly two out of three country students are found in the lowest bands of performance. Of course, that has a particularly adverse effect once these people finish schooling, because it is the rural areas where unemployment is the worst and where you therefore need to be better equipped to become employed.

         Today schools are expected to play an increasing role in the provision of vocational education and training. Vocational education and training enables students to develop their abilities whether or not they wish to compete for places in university. It is interesting that Aboriginal students are well represented in various vocational subjects at school. However, in some subjects—notably, information technology and accountancy, which are high demand subjects in the world today—their participation is lower than for non-Aboriginal students. These are subjects which enjoy greater institutional recognition and provide more secure pathways to university or TAFE.

         If you look at post-school plans after year 10 and compare Aboriginal students with non-Aboriginal students, you find that Aboriginal students in year 10 have lower aspirations than non-Aboriginal students. In other words, it is a question not just of what is being achieved but of what the expectation is. If you go in with a lower expectation, you are obviously less likely to achieve. Aboriginal students plan to leave school at the end of the compulsory years more often. Although balanced by a greater interest in apprenticeship or other vocational training in TAFE, or with other providers, this still implies lower general levels of attainment. Moreover, these differences hold even after comparisons are made between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students of similar socioeconomic status.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I think that is an important measure. The figures that this report looks at concern people coming from similar socioeconomic levels. The cultural and material advantages that young people derive from parents in the professions and management do not appear to translate for Aboriginal students into the high aspirations that would be expected given the pattern of their non-Aboriginal counterparts.

         I think it is also important to look not just at the expectations of the schools and what the system provides but at the perspectives of the students themselves—the perspectives the students have on educational experience and the quality of learning. The report says:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Educational statistics rarely report the point of view of students. Yet what young people say about their experience of learning provides valuable insights into differences in participation and attainment. Low self-esteem and perceptions of negative attitudes on the part of teachers are linked with under-enrolment in maths amongst girls and probably also with poor achievement and lack of commitment in English amongst boys.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Monitoring the quality of student experience in the middle years of secondary school can play a useful role in identifying poor morale and low satisfaction amongst particular student groups—often linked with poor academic progress. Similarly in the senior years the association between curriculum stream—on the one hand—and student-teacher rapport, student motivation, and reported parental expectations—on the other—highlights the need to strengthen programs through tangible benefits (such as vocational training) as well as pedagogically.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting perhaps to look at coping with English by gender. There is a difference between boys and girls, and this comes back to what the gentleman from Leichhardt was saying about cultural expectations.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It seems to me, as I have gone around many communities, that historically it was the women in the Aboriginal communities who looked after the home and did a lot of the basic provision and so on—that still applies—whereas the men traditionally had the men's business and the cultural aspects to attend to, perhaps some of the hunting and so on. Basically, that role has been taken away from them, particularly as Western society has impacted upon the communities. Therefore, in many ways the men find themselves with little to do, and their self-esteem tends to be low. So there are differences in approach and attitude between men and women, or boys and girls, in the Aboriginal community.

         Aboriginal students who reach year 12 have a much higher chance of failing English than non-Aboriginal students. The developing pattern of poorer attainment is already suggested by how many Aboriginal students reflect on their learning experience in year 10. As many as 40 per cent of boys at this level report coping not well or poorly. The pattern is much better for girls, though they make up a smaller proportion of students. Overall, every fourth Aboriginal student in year 10 reports making unsatisfactory progress in English. Given the links between attainment, quality of school experience and school completion rates, such a high figure is obviously a serious concern.

         Confidence obviously plays an important role. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I know that you, as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, like me, have travelled to many communities, and you will be well aware that if you do not have the confidence you often do not make a go of things. Confidence in the communities is often a major problem.

         We find that, although there are some very confident Aboriginal students in year 10, as a group they are much more likely than non-Aboriginal students to expect to do poorly in all their subjects and are just as likely to say that they will do poorly in some. Every fifth Aboriginal student has a lower level of confidence in academic progress.

         On the eve of the more specialised subjects which are introduced in the senior years of secondary school and the greater emphasis on personal responsibility for learning, many Aboriginal students already doubt their ability to continue. So it is not surprising that we have lower retention rates in the Aboriginal community going through to the senior levels at school.

         Aboriginal students are as likely, or about as likely, as other students to say that schools are successful in promoting care for the environment, respect and care for others, taking pride in achievement and valuing knowledge and ideas. But in other areas their estimations of school success are much lower. These include: being organised, working with others, believing in the value of working for the future and respecting people from other backgrounds. Responses on these items suggest much less confidence on the part of Aboriginal students in the value of a school as a vehicle for planning and implementing personal goals than it does on environmental and cultural reconciliation. So the whole attitude to school has a heavy bearing on how successful one is likely to be, and that means that we should be tailoring our programs to take account of those factors.

         One of the more depressing features of the report that I found was a question about which image best describes your school. The choice of a single image to convey feelings about school tends to confirm the finding that Aboriginal students are less likely than others to think of school as a productive experience. Aboriginal students choose `stepping stone'—the most common image used by students at whatever school level—only half as often as non-Aboriginal students. `Prison', on the other hand, they choose twice as often. This image conveys a sense of confinement devoid of positive purpose. In fact, 58 or 59 per cent of Aboriginal students in year 10 described going to school as being like going to prison. If that is the attitude—and it is an understandable attitude for all the sorts of reasons we have been talking about—then obviously we have some major problems with people being successful in that sort of environment.

         There are large differences between Aboriginal boys and Aboriginal girls on measures of student morale. Girls are consistently more positive than boys about relationships with teachers, about the overall quality of school experience and about the value of making extra effort with school work. And so I could go on, but time is running out.

         I want to make a few other comments before I close. This report tells us in a current assessment—an objective assessment, not a political assessment—that clearly there is a problem with getting education at an acceptable level for our indigenous community. We all know that there is a whole host of reasons for that, but it is a damming report and it really tells us that what has been going on for the last few years, whatever the good intent, has not worked.

         Of course, education is a cornerstone to anybody's future life. Without education these days, you will not get a job. If you do not get a job, you cannot buy a house. If you cannot buy a house, you cannot provide the proper health conditions to bring up your next generation. Then, if you do not have a job, a house and any money, you get into substance abuse and domestic violence—all the things that the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody talked about and all the things that we as a nation need to be attacking. So the cycle goes on. Frankly, the government has to improve its performance in this area.

         The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) in his second reading speech talked about changing the programs, as I understand it, from 1997. We are only just in the third quarter of 1995 and he is talking about doing something in two years time. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)—health is an important aspect of this, because more than 50 per cent of Aboriginal children going to primary schools have middle ear infection, so they cannot absorb the lessons because they have a major problem—is saying, `We have now broken off health from ATSIC, and we are going to be responsible.'

         Three weeks ago my sixth grandson was born. That boy will have an 18-year better life expectancy and all sorts of better opportunities than an Aboriginal boy born on the same day. This is 1995, when we have had 12 years of this government standing up here lecturing about all the good things it is doing. Its performance, frankly, is not good enough. We have had 12 years of this government telling us how it should be done. We have had 12 years of this government being very unctuous, frankly, about what it is all about, and the evidence shows that its methods and methodology have failed.

         —I acknowledge the concern and commitment of my colleague the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), but I would ask him and other members of the opposition—six months out from an election where the opposition parties are putting themselves forward as the alternative government, and after much breast beating and moral indignation on this issue—to say what their policies are. I am not aware of any specific policy put forward by any of your spokespersons on Aboriginal health, education or any other issue. So I challenge members of the opposition, if they are concerned about these issues, to say what their polices are.

         I quote from page 2 of the report to add some balance to the arguments presented on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill by the member for Aston:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        On the basis of the evidence presented to us we have no doubt that the educational experiences of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders have improved over the last five years. More Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders than before are involved in educational decision-making and in the delivery of educational services. More have access to education facilities. More participate in education, particularly in the technical and further education and higher education sectors. More people use their knowledge and experiences of education to contribute both to their communities and to the wider Australian community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        But equity is not just a matter of numbers. In 1994 Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders continue to be the most educationally disadvantaged groups in Australia. While more opportunities to express their views about the policy, programs and practices of education have been created, Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders remain concerned that their views are not heard. Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders continue to have the most limited, and in some cases no, access to education beyond primary school. They do not participate in education to the extent that other Australians participate, particularly in secondary education; in technical and further education and in higher education they participate only in particular and narrow fields of study. Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders still do not enjoy equitable and appropriate outcomes from education.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think a great deal has been achieved, but from a low base. Having been on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the member for Aston and I are aware of a range of complex difficulties—whether they be with coastal communities in New South Wales or in other states or in very remote locations—militating against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children making use of those expanded opportunities.

         I certainly want to comment on those issues, but I also want to comment on some of the more positive things that are happening as a result of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy which is an initiative of this government. It is fairly important that recognition is given to that policy. In May 1993, the early part of the current parliament, there was an agreement with all state and federal governments to provide better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our community. At the time, the problems were obvious to all participants. I will quote from the overview of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy for the second triennium, 1993-95, which states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        .less than 50 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children had some pre-school experience compared with a national equivalent rate of more than 90 per cent;
       </para>
       <para>
        So at the very beginning of their educational experience they are seriously disadvantaged. It continues:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        .participation in school among children of compulsory schooling age was about 85 per cent for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, and close to 100 per cent for the nation as a whole; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        .just 10 per cent of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population aged 15 years and over held post-school educational qualifications, compared with the national proportion of 31 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        There were, and still are, some major problems. The report continues further:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1991, the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody found that the most significant factor contributing to the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody was their disadvantaged and unequalled position in Australian society—socially, economically and culturally.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The social, economic and cultural factors which contribute to this situation lead to low self-esteem and reduced confidence.

         One of the reasons we are debating the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1995 is that, as we review the national Aboriginal education policy for the calendar year 1996 and when major structural changes come into the AESIP—the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program—from January 1997, we will be providing for a more equitable distribution of funds per capita and new accountability arrangements which will focus on achieving improved education outcomes for indigenous people.

         I want to refer to that issue because when speaking with a departmental person from DEET in central Queensland today, he pointed out that one of the most positive points he noted is that, now that the state education department has a fully integrated plan for Aboriginal education which is very much at one with the national strategic initiatives, there has been a real change in the attitudes of educational service providers on the ground and in the communities. That is where you will get those positive changes. You will not get practical changes if you do not have attitudinal changes from those who are providing the services such as school principals, P&amp;Cs and so on. I want to refer to the changes outlined in the Queensland education department's social justice strategy for 1994-98. I commend the Queensland government for the work it has done in this area.

        There has been a huge change. I remember a particular day in the education of my older daughter at Indooroopilly State School—an excellent school in Brisbane. I went along for the Australia Day celebrations and the students in years 1 and 2 and so on were doing a play for the assembly. The comment was made that the settlers were attacked by blacks. I thought, `Heavens! We haven't moved very far in the last 20 to 30 years if that is the best one of the better schools in Brisbane can do in terms of involving indigenous history.' It has taken a long period for things to change. That baby daughter is now 19 and in her second year at university.

         We need to recognise that for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families English is a second or third language and when we attempt to have those children conform to a European school system it is not in their interests. In talking with educators in central Queensland today I received some very positive examples of just how the initiatives that we have funded and put in place are actually working. I refer to things like the ASSPA committees where parents are very involved in the education of their children.

         I will give the House one example. There is a particular program centred in the Mackay area but which is available to all central Queensland schools. This program picks up on gifted and talented learners amongst the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. In order to develop the skills and talents of this particular group the Aboriginal education adviser has developed the following consultative mechanism.

         First of all, from the indigenous community there is selected, through consultation, a group of resource people who are then been put through an instructional skills course at the local TAFE college. It is their job to gauge the level of talent of these young students by using oral traditions, rather than written traditions which often disadvantage Aboriginal students. These adults are aged between 20 and 60 years. They work with the children by means of storytelling, dance, music and art and develop the children's skills and competencies.

          These skills and competencies are assessed through videos and photographs.

         At the same time, we are raising the profile, the respect and the interests of indigenous culture in the wider school community. We are involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community members in that school community. A lot of those projects that have been developed as part of the social justice strategy with the Queensland education department are based on working with a bottom-up approach. We have the school, the community and the education providers going through a process of consultation and involvement which will benefit not only the indigenous students but also the wider school community.

         This is what the national Aboriginal education policy is all about. This kind of initiative did not just happen overnight. It is very much at odds with what we might well term the more traditional approach.

         If we look at research across the world we see that one of the key factors in educational success and outcomes is the involvement and support of parents in the education of their children. Where you lock out any group of parents from the educational experience of their children you are going to get a less positive outcome for those children. Recent history in Queensland has shown that very few Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are now parents had access to educational opportunities. Certainly their culture and their languages were banned. It has been a major turnaround to involve those parents in these processes. People to whom I have spoken in central Queensland have advised me that those initiatives are bearing fruit.

We have a range of supports for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. They are very well defined. Certainly there are no free taxis.

         We have a situation in which the average income for most Aboriginal families, according to the member for Capricornia, is $15,000. There is something terribly, terribly wrong when the average family of Aboriginal descent in Australia has an income of $15,000. The reason for that is that social workers, such as the honourable member for Capricornia, are paid amounts of money to go out and look after these people and tell them all sorts of wonderful and exciting things, inculcating in them attitudes and values which, unfortunately and sadly, are similar to those that were exemplified by the missionaries.

In fact, the very last case that I handled as the state member for the electorate of Flinders in the Queensland parliament involved two parents, both of Aboriginal descent, who had their kids removed by a social worker. That was the same job as the member for Capricornia had before she came into this place.

         In that case, one of the kids was caught thieving. He was brought home by the police. A fairly enlightened businessman did not prosecute the kid, and the father gave him a good hiding. Two weeks later the kid was caught thieving again. He was brought home by the police and, again, as a result of an enlightened attitude by the local business house, he was not prosecuted. The father gave him another hiding. The social workers turned up and took the kid off to the doctor to be inspected. I rang the doctor and the doctor told me that he could not find any marks on the child at all. I said to the father, `Well, you did not give him much of a hiding.' He said, `It may not have been much of a hiding, but the social workers have taken my five kids off me as a result.' If you break the right of the parent to discipline the child—and we are talking about education here—you are educating the child to know that he does not have to obey his parents and educating the parents to know that they cannot discipline the child.

A number of the parents stood up and said, `The answer lies with the parents. The parents have to discipline their kids. The parents should be punished for not disciplining the kids.'

In days past they were the unfortunate and, sadly, misguided missionaries that went out and took two—arguably three—generations of kids from their parents.

         I make the point that that education is taking place out there. It is very real education in the marketplace. It is informing parents that they no longer have control over their children, and it is informing the children that parents no longer have control over their kids. It is exactly the same principle that has been espoused in the state of Queensland, with the relatively brief interlude—I suppose it is not so brief; 30 years—of government by my own party. Many people would think that what I am saying is radical. To me, there is absolutely no difference between the social workers—the do-gooders of today—and the missionaries of yesterday. There are some very good and decent missionaries, but unfortunately they were very few and far between on the frontiers of Queensland.

I would have had many pleasant days along the Cloncurry River with my shanghai. That is happening today in all of the communities throughout Queensland, not only for kids of Aboriginal descent but also for kids of white descent, particularly from parents with no educational background. They no longer have any discipline or control over their kids and they are not really very interested in education, so no great encouragement is given to the kids. As a result, the kids simply do not go to school.

There would not have been one-third of the kids at school that day. Truancy rates were 60 per cent. I informed him that I was not minister for education, but he said that, as I was minister for Aboriginal affairs, he wanted it fixed up. I admit that I appreciated him doing that. That situation was typical not only for the old reserve communities in Queensland but also for towns with kids that were predominantly of part Aboriginal descent. Those kids are simply not going to school. Those opposite can come into this place and talk about what we are going to do in the area of education, as the member for Capricornia and all of those in the bleeding hearts club have done today, but the kids are not going to school. What we have here is an interesting charade. It is a pleasant little debate in society, but it is a debate about something that is not reality in the real world. It is not happening out there at all.

         The vast bulk of the population of Aboriginal descent in Queensland come from the old reserve communities. About 30,000 of the 70,000 people of Aboriginal descent in Queensland come from the old reserve communities. Probably two-thirds of the others come from towns such as my own home town of Cloncurry, where at least half of the population would be of part Aboriginal descent. I am very proud of the town because it is an excellent example of integration in Australia and of where this country should be moving. The official figures show that in remote rural communities, such as Cloncurry, 72 per cent go on to complete 12th grade. If you come from an urban community, 73 per cent go on to complete tertiary education.

         The classification that I am seeking is that of remote areas where people of Aboriginal descent live. In terms of the definition of `remote', in the Northern Territory the only town that is not remote is Darwin. So even Alice Springs is considered to be remote in the context of this definition. Only 55 per cent of the kids from these areas complete 12th grade. When I stand here and say that the kids realise they do not have to go to school any more and that they are not going to school any more, this is backed up by the figures. In an urban community, where the parents on the whole are better educated, where people are more conditioned to do as they are told—the move with the herd mentality—they go to school.

         As far as tertiary education goes, if you come from an urban community in Australia you have twice the chance of going to a university or a tertiary institution than if you come from a non-urban community in Australia. Not only are those statistics bad; they reflect the fact that in communities such as the western towns in Queensland, and most certainly in New South Wales with which I am familiar, the people of Aboriginal descent are less likely to go away to complete 12th grade or go away to a tertiary institution.

         I thought it was a quaint notion put up by the last speaker, the member for Capricornia, that we should get back to our Aboriginal culture and that we should assert Aboriginal culture. I remember watching a person on television one night who was debating with a lady from Sydney. The lady said, `Unless our people get back to their culture then they are finished; we must educate them about our culture.' When she had finished her fairly strident assertions, the other speaker said, `Well, you might talk about getting back to your culture until the cows come home, but I suspect that on Saturday afternoon they will be in front of the television watching the match of the day in the Sydney rugby league, and on that night they will be off to the local disco.' I was so impressed with the bloke's statement and with his knowledge and understanding of the first Australians that I went to the trouble of finding out who it was. The next day I rang the television station. The person's name was Fred Hollows. I had never heard of him back in those days, but I thought, `This is a bloke calling the shots true; this is what it is like in the real world.'

         Some people may be ashamed of the cultural heritage from which I personally come, but it is the cultural heritage that the vast bulk of people of Aboriginal descent in Australia come from. It is a heritage that loves its rugby league, its country music and its rodeos, and that is the sort of world we live in and the sort of culture we aspire to, look up to and enjoy—and we are not particularly interested in that of anyone else. If you want to go to the big cities and listen to American rock music, that is fine. I have nothing against you doing it, but do not try to foist it upon us.

         In our schools throughout Australia I see kids, many of whom are of first Australian descent, having rammed down their throats that this is not good, that this business of running around with horses and working with cattle is fairly primitive, that playing rugby league is fairly brutal and that country music is hicksville. So the culture, confidence and values these kids have been taught by their parents to love are being undermined. But it is relevant to them. These people are being continuously denigrated by the education system which we have had imposed upon us.

         When I hear the rather naive previous speaker, the member for Capricornia, come into this place and give us lectures, it indicates to me that she obviously has not mixed with any people of Aboriginal descent in the whole of her life, except those who are referred to by a rather crude expression—an adjective, which obviously I will not use in this House. The second word they use, the noun, is coconut—obviously meaning white on the inside and brown on the outside. If you mix with first Australians you will hear this term very often. Clearly the member for Capricornia has mixed exclusively with those sorts of people or she would not be saying the rather stupid things she has been saying here today in this debate.

         Even the language that is used interests me. All the speakers today have used the word Aborigine continuously. If I could again hark back to my own background and my own home town of Cloncurry, the term Aborigine is never used. It is a term which is simply not in the lexicon of the local people. On an odd occasion they might use the term `Murri', or a similar term to that, but the term Aborigine is not a term used in the environment in which we live. In many cases it is an identity that has been foisted upon people and which has created terrible divisions in societies where divisions have not existed in recent decades. Undoubtedly in days past those divisions were there, and some of them were terrible divisions. Most certainly those divisions could be seen in the history of inland Queensland.

         The major reason for education is to teach kids not only history and culture but, most important of all, survival skills. If you live in these isolated areas, I venture to suggest that the survival skills needed to work in the cattle industry, the mining industry or in house building are the survival skills that are desperately needed for people in these areas to prosper. We have this place giving our people huge areas of land, but you cannot eat land. I owned a lot of land, but you cannot eat it—it does not feed your kids. Quite frankly, it does not give you pride, either. Pride does not come with owning land; pride comes from producing something from the land. We have given the people the land, but we have given the people no ability whatsoever to work that land, nor the legal mechanisms to enable them to utilise the land properly.

         There are bleeding hearts all over the place here for people of Aboriginal descent, but no-one has made a stand against the Queensland government. When I was a minister in Queensland  we  simply  passed  a  memo around. We got agreement from all the Aboriginal community councils in Queensland that we would have all houses built exclusively by people of Aboriginal descent. The net result of that was the creation of about 350 jobs over the next 18 months. There were 60 or 70 apprenticeships. All of those jobs are now being abolished. There are very few of them left in Queensland because of the current Queensland government. I have written to Mr Tickner, and I have spoken to him twice, but he has done absolutely nothing.

         I do not think Aboriginal people are much different from other people, but people of Aboriginal descent, peculiarly enough, are excellent when it comes to house building skills. In fact, on Palm Island, two white teams were taken out and black teams took over their work because they were far more efficient, their output was far higher and their work was of a much higher quality. In the early days of my ministry they were used exclusively. But there has been no stand taken by this parliament or by this government against the Queensland government which is proceeding to abolish the survival skills, the training and the education needed to provide these people with the wherewithal—not to give them fish, but to give them a fishing line so that they can catch their own fish—to be able to survive in the world out there, to hold their heads up high and to produce something of value, not only for themselves but for the greater Australian community.

         There is another point. Fortunately, with the work of people with foresight, we have also been able to record and preserve large elements of Aboriginal cultures. In so doing, we now have to face the question of what our obligations are in terms of the promotion of these cultures. First, we have an obligation as Australians to gain a much broader recognition of the depth and meaning of these cultures. Secondly, we have an obligation to do more in the education of Aboriginal children to assist them in the reconstituting and recognising of these cultures that have been destroyed or lost.

We do not understand how extraordinarily rich and important Aboriginal cultures were. It is very important to record what experts have said about this. For one thing, the lives of Aboriginal people were steeped in a tradition that we understand only marginally; that is, the tradition of religion and mystical belief. Let me read from an excellent book,

         In comparison with many others, and certainly in comparison with Europeans, the Aborigines were a deeply religious people. Religious feeling was manifested through ritual observance and through mythic expression—and, essentially, taken for granted. And an intrinsic part of it was a deep emotional attachment to the land, their own land. The whole countryside was full of signs and clues that were directly and indirectly relevant to their lives. It was made familiar and intimate to them through mythic beings who were believed to be manifested at specific sites, always present, and approachable through the medium of ritual. These were eternal or enduring elements, underlining continuity sustained through religious practice. At one conceptual level, everything was brought together into one expanded socio-cultural environment. The deities were manifested predominantly through man, and other living things and other features were selected as intermediaries or symbolic representations: all drew on the same life force.

        This deeply mystical and religious concept, this depth, tied the Aboriginal people to the land, to their cultures and to their belief systems. Then European man came in and destroyed much of this, often not even having an idea of what was happening. Now we see Aborigines whose whole systems we have destroyed and we say, `Look at them. They are the lost people.' Of course they are the lost people because they have lost these belief systems. They have lost much of this tradition and culture. A lot of this is our fault.

         If we are to give these people meaning in life, we do not need more of the rodeos that the member for Kennedy talked about; we need to be able to give them some sense of their own identity, their history and their tradition.

         Of course you cannot totally bring back the past, in that sense. Aborigines will also have to have a tradition of European education.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know what was happening? It took years before the teachers at the school realised what the problem was. The kids would come to school and the teachers would try to teach them, but they could not get the message across so they thought the kids were ignorant and foolish and that their IQs were low. But the children could not hear the teachers. Because of our neglect, we have created a situation in which the Aboriginal hearing problem is at crisis point.

When this problem was first encountered the educational institutions said, `They cannot hear. It's a health problem.' The health authorities said, `No, it's not a health problem. It's in the classroom so it's an education problem.' So the health and education authorities were mucking around trying to decide whose problem this was. Meanwhile, children in these schools were not learning because they could not hear.

         I conclude by making a couple of comments about the deep richness of Aboriginal culture. We do not even know a half of what existed. We have not even recorded it. We do not study it enough. We do not understand it enough. But we always think of the superiority of our systems. If we look at what anthropologists and other people who have done a good job in recording what the Aboriginal people believed, we find that in their belief systems there was a whole richness of not only symbolism but also philosophical thinking, serious thinking, about the nature of life, the nature of death, the nature of the human world and the meaning of the word `existence'. All those issues which we pride ourselves on in terms of Western philosophy and Western religion are present in the Aboriginal tradition. Let me read one little creation story:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Muruwari tribe believed that Bida-Ngulu, sometimes called Wi-Bida-Ngulu, was the creator of all things. The name meant `forehead of fire' and his face must never be looked upon. He lived in the sky and spoke with a deep, booming voice when thunder was heard. His greatest gift to men and women when he created them had been a dhuwidi, or living spirit. He had also given them their totems, which had remained their spiritual affiliation since the Dreamtime. To maintain life, he had left behind many good spirits which the people believed to be always hovering close to them. They stood quietly before making a request to these spirits, perhaps asking for a change in the weather or saying: `Please give us fish in the river.'
       </para>
       <para>
        The point about this creation story is god and his similarity to the Christian God, the creator of the world, especially the Old Testament figure. It is almost identical in terms of its symbolism. Yet we believe that our religions and our cultures are far superior. There is a story here about this god manifesting himself in the world in the shape of a man and mixing amongst the people. That is a story which we are also familiar with in the Christian tradition.

         What I am saying is that it is time for us to show that we are committed to the meaningfulness and importance of Aboriginal culture and the restoration of those belief systems that have been lost. Aboriginal education has to be oriented in this direction. Of course, practical matters are involved. There have to be practical skills. But in the area of practical skills, it is amazing that we are now discovering that many Aboriginal bush medicines have a very scientific basis. We are now funding a project to look at the similarities in and the Western scientific basis of Aboriginal medical knowledge. Years ago we used to think that this was all gibberish and nonsense. It is this transformation and this understanding of the worth of this culture which we have to embed in the Australian nation. More particularly, we must give Aboriginal children the opportunity to learn these traditions for themselves.

          Dying Inside

         , Duncan Graham discusses the causes of Aboriginal deaths in custody. It is not just about external manifestations, maltreatment by police forces or other people or races: it is called `dying inside' because many of these people have died inside their own self, their own spirit, their own sense of worth. They died in this way because much of what constituted their culture and the meaning of their existence was lost. Therefore, there was hardly anything left. Not only was there very little opportunity in employment and education through the white man's system but also there was nothing much left of the traditional culture and the traditional meaning. In that sense, therefore, many people, especially the younger ones, feel they have no identity or that their identity is totally confused or lost. In that sense they want to recapture their Aboriginality.

         The honourable member for Kennedy said that this is nothing more than the work of white social workers and do-gooders. What a nonsense. If there is one thing that the Aboriginal people themselves have built up in the movement of Aborigines in the last 30 years it is their own consciousness of what they want, their own attempt to restore that feeling of worth in themselves through the restoration of the meaning of their culture, the richness of their culture, especially the spirituality, the belief systems and the philosophy of their culture, and in so doing to feel that they have a place in the modern world—and they do, because they can teach us something about the real meaning of existence rather than simply the pursuit of material goods all the time. In that sense we can learn a lot from Aboriginal people. I think that we can do this through the education system. Aboriginal education must be oriented towards achieving not only the practical skills of survival but also other skills.

         —I rise to enter into the debate on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1995. The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) spent a considerable amount of time on anthropology and cultural understanding of the Aboriginal people. I wholly agree with much of what he said. If the debate continued down this vein, we might re-establish what the real function of this parliament is about, and that is, an exchange of views on the floor of the House between members who are elected to it.

         That having been said, we are now looking at funding for Aboriginal education.

         As a member of the government, the honourable member for Calwell said the education system must merge the Aboriginal and European cultures. The present government has been in office for 12 years and is still saying, `Something must happen.' This has been going on for 12 years.

         I looked at the second reading speech because I have taken an interest in Aboriginal affairs for quite a period of time now in the parliament. In the fourth paragraph the minister said that the government intends to make major changes to the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program from January 1997, with a new funding triennium to commence at that time. The new funding triennium is fine. But the government is going to `make major changes'. This really is an admission of defeat of what they brought in in 1989.

         Last year in this debate I encouraged the government to set out very clearly some measurements of whether we are making progress in this area, as it should in any other program. One of the problems in Aboriginal educational funding is that the government of the day—and this government has been there for 12 years—is not prepared to say, `As a goal, for the next three years we want a participation rate for Aboriginal students of 30 per cent or 40 per cent at year 10 or year 12.' But the government is not prepared to set a goal.

         I would be absolutely delighted if we made some small progress towards set goals. Often in this parliament we set the standard too high for what we want to achieve overnight. This is a complex area. It does involve a loss of dignity by a group of people. All people are equal. The previous speaker did indicate that there has been a tendency to look down on this group or that group of people. He is quite right. There should be none of that because every human being should be seen equally.

         In this area we find however that the government has not really set about systematically wanting to achieve set goals in a whole range of areas. The government has nominated three national priorities for funding in this second triennium. The first relates to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. As a by-line to that, it is very interesting to look at that issue. Looking at the Australian Institute of Criminology figures, the death rate has now flattened out. There was a huge peak in the number of Aboriginal deaths in custody at that time. Paralleling that peak, almost identically, was an increase in the number of deaths in custody of non-Aboriginal people. Now the numbers have all dropped down again.

         A lot of that came about because of the focus in public debate and you had this imitative behaviour, about which criminologists know quite a lot—if you talk a lot about it, you actually increase the number of people who choose to kill themselves. That is a tragic thing, but the government says it is going to deal with this area in its education.

         The second thing was to implement the national Aboriginal languages and literacy strategy and also implement the national reconciliation and schooling strategy. I wonder in these terms whether we as a parliament are being too wise for our own benefit. Is it possible to achieve some of these grandiose ideas with the funding that is being contributed?

         I would suggest to the government that it really needs to set up some very clear achievable goals in education in this area. Then year by year we should be able to progress towards those goals. Maybe each year we could move the goals on as we progressively achieve the set goals of the previous year.

         I am concerned that we have before us another proposal to make major changes to the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program. A previous speaker in here from Queensland said that Queensland has been more successful than any other state in its retention rates of Aboriginal young people for year 12. That is true. In fact, per head of population Queensland actually retains double the number of Aboriginal young people in year 12 than in any other state.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Looking into that, it appears that one of the fundamental factors in making that contribution has been stability in the education delivery system. Over the years in lots of other states there has been chopping and changing. That has also been difficult for the European children to take. But for the Aboriginal children I believe that that has been a major contributing factor as to why they have not maintained their schooling.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But in Queensland over the years there has not been that chopping and changing in the delivery of education. So it has been much more stable, much more predictable and much more able to be understood by Aboriginal students. So they have progressed through the various stages without having either year 10 results or certificates changed or the curriculum changed; or getting started, then getting halfway through and having it changed on them and really not following it. It is okay in our culture, we are used to being adaptable; but for a lot of the Aboriginal young people that is not the case. So stability in what is actually being delivered in regard to education is very important.

It has now been 12 years and they still have not got it right. They are now pushing it out and holding out a great hope that in the future we are going to get it right.

         I only wish that in this parliament there could be a recognition of setting some reasonably achievable goals  whereby in a bipartisan way as a parliament we say, `We are going to move towards achieving these set goals of literacy rates and numeracy skills across the different grade levels for Aboriginal young people.'

         No matter what we say about the culture, the anthropology and how important it is to teach that, we still have to all come back and face the fact that these are the most educationally disadvantaged young people in Australia and things have to happen to try to improve that.

         One of the difficulties in trying to merge the two cultures in this way is that, if we are going to spend a lot of time on Aboriginal culture and anthropology, which is fascinating and very interesting, we have to ask how much we can really fit into the curriculum and how much can really be taught by teachers. Are we really going to teach English language to the Aboriginal young people? I think everybody would agree: yes, we are. Most of the Aboriginal elders that I have spoken to would also say that it is fundamental. They have to have one foot in one culture and another foot in another culture.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That is a commonsense understanding of the merging of the two cultures. But there is a limit to what teachers can do in the six hours in which they are teaching. There has to be a selection of what they are going to be taught. I agree that it would be great if we could continue to teach the spiritual aspects of the Aboriginal culture. At the same time, if we talk about that, are we going to talk about the spiritual aspects of European culture in the same way? That will still take time.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Really fundamental things have to be got across. First of all, we have to get our Aboriginal young people in many parts of Australia to just go to school and stay at school. I have talked with one of the teachers in Arnhem Land who has been teaching for 22 years in one area. He said, `On the statistics, they stay until year 10, but the actual grade of teaching which is being achieved is grade 3.' People in parliament get the impression that we are making real progress. He said to me that the real difficulty is getting them through to a year 10 standard. Because they miss so much schooling or do not come to school and often are not followed up, they get to the age of 15 but still only achieve a grade 3 standard, and that is a problem.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There needs to be a little realism. We need to set goals that are achievable. I find that there is still not that acceptance at this level. As I said, we have the government saying that it will make major changes. After being in government for 12 years, it can say that only three objective standards have improved over the last four years. It says, for example, that between 1989 and 1993 the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students staying on to year 12 increased from 14 per cent to 33 per cent. That is really good news. During the same period, the number of indigenous people attending university has doubled. That is good.

         But what about some measurable outcomes for people achieving grade 6 education? What about the standards of literacy and numeracy, which are fundamental skills in the Australian cultural context, irrespective of background? The government ought to be focusing on and bringing to the parliament what the goals are. Have the state and federal ministers for education really sat down with hands-on experience and put up realistic goals? I sometimes wonder whether this does not happen because we are too scared that we might be seen to fail.

         It is time that we be realistic about the way in which we go about this. We should not continue with broad generalisations about how we are spending money in Aboriginal education. Let us understand what is required. Let us not overload the curriculum. Let us make sure that we identify those key areas that need teaching in those schools. Let us get on with it and be clear about what our goals are.

I do not have any doubt that lots of European teachers want to contribute to Australia's progress in education in these ways. It can be achieved. But, while we have generalisations, changes and a lack of specificity about what the money is really for, we will not make a lot of progress. It would be my request to the government that it become much more focused, that it identify at the ministerial councils of education ministers much more clearly what the goals are and that it hold the bureaucracy to achieving those goals.

         As I said, last year in this debate I requested clearly identifiable objectives and standards by which we can measure whether we are making real progress. I see two in this document. I welcome and applaud that progress. I hope that next year, instead of having only two criteria in here, we might have 10 or 15 so that we can really say in future years, `Back in 1995, we did set up some criteria by which we can judge whether we are making progress.'

         Let us not keep changing the delivery of these programs. That is half the problem. Teachers get frustrated with it. On the one hand, they just get used to what is going to be delivered, where they can get financial assistance to help certain young people, and the next thing they find is that it has all changed. There are different types of forms and different goals. When they just start to make some real progress in the area, it gets cut off. There needs to be a very clear examination of that. I hope that next year, when we are here, we will see clear goals, clear objectives and some measurement as to whether we have achieved them.

He talked about the spiritual aspects of the Aboriginal culture. He seemed to be suggesting that there might be too much emphasis placed on that. It always seems amazing to me that no-one ever raises the issue of Christianity being rammed down people's throats in so many of our schools. No-one questions the teaching of religious studies. I know that in my area some friends of mine did not want their children to participate in religious education and that their kids were ostracised. We do not question religious studies being taught in our schools, but we seem to question teaching the spiritual aspects of Aboriginal culture.

         I have no disagreement with the honourable member for Braddon talking about achievable goals being set. But, considering the way that he talked about this Labor government being in power 12 years, one would imagine that absolutely nothing has been achieved in 12 years. There are those of us who have had some contact with Aboriginal communities. The honourable member for Kennedy seems to think that unless you are from an outback electorate you do not really have an understanding of Aboriginal matters. I originally come from Kempsey on the north coast. I have a pretty good understanding of such matters. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, I was brought up not all that far from Burnt Bridge and near Green Hills. You know about Purfleet at Taree.

         In supporting the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill, I want to use as an example a particular training program in Aboriginal cultural tourism at Wallaga Lake on the south coast of New South Wales. The direct result of this program has been the formation of a quite successful business called the Umbarra Cultural Tours. This particular project is in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). I must say that the member for Eden-Monaro has always supported this venture and has maintained a very close interest in it. In fact, I was talking to him about it today.

         I would preface my remarks by drawing the attention of the House to the close link between land rights, Aboriginal education and training, and the revitalisation of Aboriginal culture. Following the enactment of the New South Wales Land Rights Act by the Wran Labor government in 1983 and the formation of local land councils, many Aboriginals sought to validate their claims to particular areas of land. They turned to their old people for information about their sites, history and culture and sought further proof for their claims in the documents of non-Aboriginal settlers, historians, archaeologists and anthropologists. Quite suddenly, Aboriginal people could see a new and very real need for some form of education.

         There was a further step in the process. Once an Aboriginal community had gained title to its land, the question arose about possible uses, both cultural and economic, to which the land could be put. The obvious answer at Wallaga Lake was cultural tourism. Once that decision had been made, the people saw the need for a community based training program.

         It is to the great credit of the Wollongong office of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which was then responsible for the Wallaga Lake area, that funding was made available for the training program. The regional manager believed, quite correctly in my opinion, that a thoroughgoing training program would not only assist the community in developing a successful business but also stimulate its members to play a more active role in its various organisations—such as the land council, the housing company and the preschool committee.

         This is exactly what happened. Before the training program commenced, the community's affairs had been left in the hands of a few willing people. But, as training progressed, the trainees began to give voice to their opinions and to stand for executive positions. They brought to these organisations a more informed understanding of meeting procedures. This resulted in better conducted meetings and in their organisations becoming more accountable to both the community and government funding agencies.

         Community leaders at Wallaga Lake are convinced that, had training been restricted to the accustomed low budget, short-term programs, then nothing of any significance would have been achieved and the community would have continued to be one of the most demoralised on the south coast. During the project's second year, the training program faltered because of funding delays and uncertainties. It was left to a small group of half a dozen people who persisted with a series of short-term courses.

         Towards the end of that year, with the assistance of further DEET funding, they were able to attract a number of other younger people to join them in Aboriginal studies and tour guide training. These courses in particular opened their eyes to the need to make use of written resources and other information made available through organisations such as the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies here in Canberra and the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service.

         Since those early days, the activities of Umbarra Cultural Tours have expanded considerably.

The afternoon of the first day was spent educating the teachers in Aboriginal culture and history. The second day was spent, class by class, with the children themselves.

         Quite early in the training it was realised that, if the proposed tourism business—which included a cultural centre and cabin accommodation—were to be successful, it would need to be developed very gradually. They identified seven steps, each of which had the potential to be a stand-alone financial success. Doing it this way, they realised, gave them the chance to grow with the project, learning more sophisticated skills as they went. It also gave them the opportunity to call a stop at any point should it be decided that further developments would interfere unduly with the life of the local community.

         By the end of the second year, the training group had defined further areas of training, such as office administration and procedures, computer skills, and bookkeeping and accounting. Since then, they have arranged for follow-up training in areas of particular need, such as trail construction and horticulture. These courses have been conducted at Wallaga Lake in conjunction with Bega skillshare. In addition, several trainees have from time to time sought individual tuition in English, mathematics and bookkeeping to better equip them for specialised jobs within the business. In short, on-the-job training has become a normal part of their working life.

         As honourable members would be aware, NAIDOC week, a time when Aboriginals and Islanders celebrate their history and culture, falls in July each year. This is a particularly busy time for Umbarra Cultural Tours, which has school activities scheduled for each and every day over this period. The remark has been made that, were this to happen in all parts of Australia, the reconciliation process between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians would be considerably accelerated.

I believe it provides an excellent example of how government funding can be used to foster Aboriginal initiatives in tertiary education and training. The results are many. It has provided employment at Wallaga Lake, enhanced community self-esteem, encouraged the people to uncover many details of their history and culture, and given them the ability to educate non-Aboriginal Australians in their ancient traditions.

         —I have a good news story tonight—that is, a company in my electorate, Ortech Industries, has signed a $30 million export deal with a company in the Philippines. The Ortech Industries company was formed as a result of a management buyout of Stramit Industries. I am sure anyone from the building industry in this House would know and understand the technology of the Stramit system, which was devised by a Bendigo resident who formed a company which became a leader in building technology throughout the world.

         This is a very exciting project for Ortech Industries. I have been involved with the company on the development of and interest in this project. It is proposed that 3.9 million houses—that is correct, Mr Deputy Speaker: 3.9 million houses—be built in the Philippines over a period of five years at a cost of some $550 million. There is a massive housing shortage in the Philippines which has resulted from a number of housing relocations occurring in a whole range of areas. All the people in one area which has been affected by the activity of volcanoes are to be relocated. Ortech Industries and the Philippines government will work on a cooperative basis to house these people. Also, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, in some of the poorer areas of the Philippines many thousands of people live adjacent to rubbish dumps; they will also be relocated to these homes.

         The object of the exercise is to set up 20 plants in the Philippines, using Australian technology combined with local Philippine technology, to produce a low cost home. That low cost home—and I have seen the prototype—consists of a concrete floor, steel roofing and a cement rendered exterior.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Of course, the interior of that low cost home, if made in Australia, would have been of straw Stramit type sections—that is, compressed strawboard. But in the Philippines nine million hectares of land are used for rice farming. Generally, the farmers on that land are poor as they have no other income; more specifically, if the return from rice is at a low level, they have a very poor income. The farmers have had no demand for the rice straw and have been used to burning it.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But now, utilising the technology available from Ortech Industries, the plan is to make houses from rice strawboard panels. This will add to the farmers' income and, within those 20 provinces, enable them to survive as primary producers. So the internal walls in the building of these homes will be made from rice strawboard panels. They will be supported by steel which will be formed in Australia and exported to the Philippines.

         On August 21, a letter of intent was signed by the company and the Cooperative Union of the Philippines. Machinery will be sent to the Philippines, and technology from Australia will be used to train the people in the Philippines. The group leader, Zinnia Teruel, the regional director of the Philippines Department of Science and Technology, was in Bendigo recently with a Philippines development team.

         All in all, it seems to me that there could be some very exciting opportunities for the Ortech company and other Australian firms associated with this project. There is obviously a vast market for this prototype housing, which comes at a very low cost but which is very effective, particularly in those tropical climates, with the cement floor and the cement rendered exterior making it weatherproof. It should present wonderful opportunities for Ortech—and it is great to hear a good news story.

         For a variety of historical and geographical reasons, Australia's involvement with the Gulf states has been minimal. This is not good and is contrary to the real interests of Australia. Australia enjoys an excellent reputation in the Gulf region. Our Australian brand of political involvement does not need domination of the Gulf or exploitation of its resources. We never try to take political advantage of any region.

         For some time now Australia has lacked any diplomatic or trade representation in Kuwait. I think this is unfortunate. I know that the expenses of such establishments are relatively high and the budget for this year is now set. However, I think that it should be possible for Australian authorities to consult with the Kuwaiti foreign ministry to look for a suitable Kuwaiti citizen to act as Australia's honorary consul in Kuwait. It is in our interests for us to have a suitable person with high level Kuwaiti contacts who can help Australian business find the right doors to knock on and someone who can help his Kuwaiti compatriots find some useful investment in Australia. Kuwait has over $100 billion invested overseas, but very little of it in Australia.

All political parties in Australia support the policy of Australia as an international trader. Yet this Gulf region is being neglected. This is more by accident than design.

Mr Holland's reports are recognised up to Supreme Court level. His detailed report agreed with the original AFP assessment; namely, that he could not establish whether any of the four documents presented to the AFP were genuine documents or otherwise as he did not have access to the originals.

Their actions while they were being arrested were only to protect themselves from the blows to the knees and from the punches they were receiving from the police.

         I do believe the police got a little agitated after I was told to speak French and I then spoke in French to them and again repeated my protests. I was then arrested when a Norwegian television camera crew put their camera in my face. Inside that holding cell, I, with the others, was asked to grab the bars and spread my legs. Next to me was a young Japanese student, probably 17 years of age, who could not speak any English or French. He followed what I was doing and was in no way resisting anything that was asked of him.

         They grabbed this boy by his belt and pulled him out to a point where he could hardly keep himself upright. Then they kicked his legs from underneath him until he fell crashing to the ground. They then grabbed him by the scrotum and dragged him to his feet. They did this repeatedly until I was taken away. After five hours of interrogation, in which they alleged that I had pushed and punched the police, I asked them to charge me so that they could make more of a fool of Jacques Chirac than he has made of himself in the world's eyes.

         —Recent statements by the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, concerning the involvement of the churches in the political life of Victoria deserve the greatest condemnation. If members of the federal coalition sit back and give their tacit support to these comments, they too deserve condemnation. To on the one hand submerge yourself in the rhetoric of individualism, as members of the coalition so often do in this House when they defend the individual against international conventions and big government, yet on the other hand turn a blind eye to Jeff Kennett's authoritarianism constitutes abject hypocrisy.

         If Jeff Kennett were a fascist, a bovver-boot boy like Benito Mussolini, for example, we could understand this desire to bring the church to heel. But before he was elected Jeff Kennett did not ever say he was opposed to elections, free speech, an independent judiciary or the pluralism that characterises Western democracies. Sure, we knew he was a right wing lover of the corporate sector, and we all suspected he would be into cronyism, but most people did not think that he would start acting like a reborn Mussolini.

         Now the undeniable truth is that Jeff Kennett is beginning to seriously resemble a fascist dictator. Jeff Kennett knows that in the absence of an effective opposition the churches constitute the most serious obstacle to his economic and political vandalism. That is why Mussolini, aware that the church might become his strongest source of opposition, set about wooing the Catholic Church in prewar Italy.

         When bribery and pork-barrelling failed, the police and the bovver boys were sent in to close down particular Catholic organisations. Sending in the police or his own special squad is not likely to endear the Premier to the Victorian community. He can get away with that down at Albert Park or at Richmond Secondary College, but out in the northern suburbs I think we would take offence if he started burning books and storming presbyteries. In essence, what Kennett is doing is firing the first salvos in the war against his real opponents—the churches.

         Now that the churches constitute one of the major bulwarks of opposition to Kennett's morally bankrupt policies, they have been targeted for a bit of jackbootism. The sad reality is that the disappearance of the state opposition has forced the churches to assume this position of opposition. So bad are things in the state ALP, there is a defectors list longer than your arm.

         In my electorate of Wills, as I am sure is the case in so many other electorates, the churches are a crucial ingredient in the political life of the community. When I held a jobs forum at the Don Bosco Centre in Brunswick prior to the 1995 budget, Bishop Jeremy Ashton from the Anglican Church in Merlynston, Brother David O'Brien and Father Peter Rankin from Don Bosco, and the Reverend Alistair McRae from the Uniting Church, West Brunswick were all in attendance. Each expressed serious concern about unemployment, in particular youth unemployment. Each expressed a desire for governments to allocate greater resources to the problems of unemployment.

         Again, showing great equanimity, representatives of churches of various denominations, including the Reverend Dick Wooton, Father Mark Crawford, Father Len Thomas, Bishop Ashton and the Reverend Alistair McRae, were in attendance when I held a press conference for visiting Sinn Fein peace envoy, Jim Neeson. The truth is that the churches and their representatives cannot and should not avoid politics. The more governments—federal and state—reduce their outlays, the more churches and their communities feel the pressure. Ask any church leader how things are and you will be told that the church is acquiring more and more responsibilities and is being stretched financially to the limit as it attempts to compensate for the withdrawal of government services and funding. Preening yourself or snaring a photo opportunity at a charity ball, as Jeff Kennett and his philistine mates love to do, will not camouflage the anti-social policies of the Kennett government.

         Given my knowledge of the local churches in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, I cannot see them caving in under the weight of the crude, fascistic pronouncements of Jeff Kennett. The Premier's arrogance and self-deception—not to mention his political stupidity—may know no boundaries, but it is no recipe for eternal success. The people cannot and will not live on prayer alone. To chide the churches for allegedly abandoning their spiritual responsibilities in favour of politics only reveals how reactionary Jeff Kennett is. The community knows that privatisation—federal and state—will never serve the interests of an egalitarian society. I hope the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) is in there telling the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that. The community knows that the term `reform' is nothing but a euphemism for economic vandalism and cronyism.

         —I wish to talk about bank fees and charges, which are of vital concern to families in my electorate and throughout Australia. Last Friday was the deadline set by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) for the banks to indicate whether or not they are prepared to introduce a no-frills account or a basic banking product. It appears that most banks are willing to comply with the Treasurer's request. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the commitment of the Commonwealth Bank to introduce a basic banking product as I would welcome its decision to abolish over-the-counter fees for disabled customers and offer new exemptions for some age and war veteran pensioners.

         I would also like to take a little time to reiterate what a basic banking product is so that there can be no misunderstanding about this matter within the major banks. As is the case in so many areas of public policy, the devil could well be in the detail. The banks must understand what we mean by a basic banking product. It is one which has no account keeping fees, one which has more than one free transaction a week, one which has reasonable access to over-the-counter services, one which provides those who are unable to use ATMs with access to over-the-counter services and so on.

         In the last fortnight we have come a long way on this question of getting a basic banking product. But the banks must understand that a basic banking product must be more than a PR exercise. We cannot let the banks hide these accounts. They must be promoted by the banks, and staff must be trained to advocate them. There will be a continuing role for members of this House, particularly on this side, to ensure that the banks are kept honest in this endeavour.

         In outlining the case for a no-frills account, the PSA report also said that the banks should not seek to increase their overall revenue from fees but should concentrate on changing the structure of existing fees to make them more efficient. My message this evening is very clear: the banks should not try to pay for the cost of providing a basic banking product by lifting other charges, particularly transaction charges. This is but one reason why I find the comments by the ANZ chief executive, Don Mercer, made in China so arrogant. He said that banks should be charging more for transactions but `he would be lynched if he uttered those sentiments in Australia'. I dare say he would, and he would not just be lynched by people in this House but by many of his own customers.

         The same Mr Mercer said earlier this year that `compulsory basic banking is almost an insult'. He went on to say, `The last thing we need right now is someone trying to regulate us into a time warp.' I tell Mr Mercer that the government is quite prepared to re-regulate the banks if they do not make progress towards a basic banking account. As far as the ANZ is concerned, we know that they do not really believe in the account and they will have to be watched all of the time. My view is that if this bank or any other bank starts moving to across-the-board transaction fee increases the government must re-regulate.

         It is a strong view in the community that the only winners from financial deregulation are large corporate borrowers. The losers have been small to medium sized businesses and the banks' retail customers. The problem we have with the banks is that they only want to cater to the top end of town. They want to be merchant banks, not retail banks. It is no coincidence that some executives who run retail banking are now paid by massive incentive schemes. That is, if they grab more money off a pensioner through fees and charges their pay goes up substantially.

         As the Coles-Myer wrangling demonstrates, shareholders need to know that board decisions are made for their benefit and not just for the benefit of a few in the privileged inner circle on the board. Shareholders and the public have a right to know what benefits are derived by directors by way of loans and many other concessions. This is critical to ensure that directors are seen to be at arm's length in general deliberations on fees and charges. Good corporate governance means that banks should immediately take steps to disclose this information, and I call on them to do so.

        The Government should respect families more and make decisions to benefit families. Families are what Australia is made of, and should be looked after by those who are chosen to make the big decisions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The family is the cornerstone of society and will crumble if not supported properly. Peace and harmony in family life have a far reaching effect on the world at large. Concern for the good of the family and for the advancement of each of its members should be their first thought.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Government should encourage good schools that teach honesty, integrity and respect. The children of families will one day become a part of Australia's future and need a good education to be able to do their part for Australia. Australia needs more better educated people, especially those who learn rules of good character. These people can and will make it far and others need to be encouraged by good schools to do the same.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Government should also encourage more jobs. Too many people  are relying only on payments like the dole. If Government encouraged Australian business they would not have to import so much from overseas. This would create more jobs here in Australia and the people of Australia could have the opportunity to get a job and do their part. Children will grow up and need jobs too. Government should give them the chance to get one.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Families on farms and land should be looked after and encouraged. They are barely existing, yet without them our family would be much poorer. They work so hard for so little, they don't want to give up but it is so hard for them to make ends meet. So hard that they cannot even encourage their own children to work on the land. Government has to be more sensitive in their needs before it is too late.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Government needs to recognise the importance of the family, especially the importance of each of its members. The role of the father is not just a breadwinner, he is important to the upbringing of future Australians. The role of a mother is that of a full time nurse, cook, cleaner, companion, accountant and so many other things she must do, that to hire a person to do each of these chores would be impossible. Give parents respect and restore their prestige. Make them proud to be giving Australia their best.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Government should encourage more Australians rather than bringing in more people from overseas. Government should support parents raising families on their own and help them. When children are neglected in these families, the family unit breaks down and all society is affected.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Government should not stereotype families. Every family is different, unique, each having different requirements. They need to be loved, respected, assisted and advised. The Government needs to support all families because they are Australian.

        (1) Since the humanitarian crisis began in Rwanda in April last year, the Government has sought to contribute to international efforts to bring lasting peace to Rwanda. In visits to Rwanda by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 6-7 September last year and by a Parliamentary delegation (Senators Stephen Loosley and David MacGibbon, the Hon Roger Price MP, Mr Bob Halverson MP) from 23-27 January we have emphasised the importance of the process of national reconciliation in Rwanda. In has responses to six Questions Without Notice in the Senate concerning Rwanda and Burundi since May last year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs underlined the need for all political groups to participate in negotiations to reach a political settlement in Rwanda. The Government believes that more needs to be done to produce a sustainable political solution to Rwanda's problems and indeed those of the immediate region. We continue to encourage the Government of Rwanda, its neighbours and the rest of the international community to cooperate to help create the conditions that will allow the return of Rwandan refugees, reduce political tensions and sustain the healing process in Rwanda and the region.

        In response to two Questions Without Notice in the Senate this year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed concern about the continuing political tensions in Burundi and emphasised the importance of sustaining the momentum of preventive diplomacy efforts by the international community. The Government continues to believe that preventive strategies must continue to be pursued to advance the process of national reconciliation and avoid an escalation of violence in Burundi. These strategies have been operating at three levels: preventive diplomacy, peace building to create effective governmental institutions and to meet the economic and social needs of the country, and contingency planning options for possible intervention by the international community such as preventive deployment.

        (2) (a) The Prime Minister advised the UN Secretary-General, Dr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, during his visit to Australia from 26-30 April, that Australia would be willing to negotiate a stand-by forces agreement with the UN. Under the UN's Standby arrangements, countries provide the UN with a list of resources which might, subject to a case-by-case consideration by Governments, be made available to a particular UN peace keeping operation. Forty two countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand are now participating in the arrangements. The Standby system applies to the full range of functions of UN peace keeping operations and is intended to enhance the UN's planning capacity for these operations. The Standby arrangements could be used to protect civilian and aid workers, if this function were included in the mandate of a specific peace keeping operation.

        (b) If Australia participates in the UN's Standby arrangements, the Government will consider requests to contribute personnel to UN peace keeping operations using the same case-by-case approach it currently employs. The criteria considered are still being refined but include consideration of whether the operation has clear and achievable goals and clearly defined termination or review points; what other resources are likely to be available for the operation; how much Australian interests are engaged, including regional, alliance and humanitarian interests and community attitudes; what costs the contribution might incur, including the effect on the Australian Defence Force's capacity to undertake other tasks including national defence; what Australia's level of commitment to other operations is at the time, having regard among other things to our reputation as a supporter of the United Nations; what training and other benefits will accrue to the Australian Defence Force; and what risk to personnel is involved.

        (3) The specific mandated responsibility of peace keepers for the civilian population will vary between operations. It is, however, being increasingly accepted by the international community that, even in the absence of a formal mandate authorising the use of force under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, peace keepers who are present when a serious, life-threatening violation of human rights is occurring or about to occur, have a duty, if they realistically can do something to stop it, not to stand idly by. There will, however, be cases where individual peace keepers will be caught out by events and will be unable to act effectively. To the extent to which peace keepers can act to prevent an atrocity they should do so. There may be cases where a peace enforcement operation could be considered necessary to protect civilians. In such cases, peace enforcement should be undertaken with clear, achievable objectives, an appropriate mandate authorised under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and by an adequately resourced and equipped force. Difficulties have arisen in operations where forces mandated and resourced for peace keeping have been required to undertake peace enforcement actions. In these cases, the "peace keepers" have not always had the capacity or the authority to provide adequate protection to the civilian populations they have been mandated to protect.

        (4) Following the adoption of Security Council Resolution 955, which established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the Government decided to amend the Bill before Parliament relating to the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, so it would also incorporate Australia's obligations in relation to the war crimes tribunal for Rwanda. The International War Crimes Tibunals Act (1995) was passed by the Parliament in February, making Australia one of the first countries to have implemented SCR 955 in domestic legislation. In addition, Sir Ninian Stephen is a judge of the Appeals Chamber of the tribunal (which it shares with the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia); the Government supported Sir Ninian's election to the Tribunal.

        (5) The United Nations Development Program together with other United Nations agencies have been working closely with the Ministry of Justice to implement programs for the rehabilitation of Rwanda's justice system. The Rwandan Minister for Justice presented a progress report on the justice sector at the UNDP Round-table Mid term Review Meeting in Kigali on 6 and 7 July. The Minister reported that fifty foreign judges were being recruited as a stop-gap measure while 120 Rwandan "non jurist magistrates" are being trained. A bill to change the Constitution to allow foreign judges to preside in Rwanda is currently before the Parliament. Nine public prosecutors offices have begun assisting the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda with preparing cases. Work is expected to be completed on a new prison facility to house 5,000 prisoners by September. Legislative reform is underway to assist in reasserting the rule of law and to create the key mechanisms of the Arusha Accords (the Supreme Court and the Council of Magistrates). The UNICEF program to separate child prisoners from adults has begun. The Minister also outlined that priorities for the next six months would be the training of 250 personnel (including deputy public prosecutors, non-jurist magistrates and clerks of the court), establishment of the mechanisms of the justice system (as per the Arusha Accords) and implementation of a mechanism for identification of detainees.

        (6) (a) The Australian Government has pledged a total of $18.5 million for relief activities for Rwanda and Burundi from the aid progra since the crisis commenced in late 1993. Included in this pledge is an amount of up to $5 million from the 1995/96 Humanitarian Relief program earmarked for activities in the health sector, possibly building on the work of the Australian Defence Force. This would involve programs through NGOs and international agencies and could include additional funding for traumatised children (and adults), immunisation programs, HIV programs in camps and assistance to re-establish some form of basic health service through international agencies.

This assistance has been directed at relief needs and channelled through the World Food Programme ($2.1 million), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ($3.7 million), United Nations Children's Fund ($1.3 million) and Australian and international NGOs ($5.8 million). Along with the Australian Defence Force contribution for the medical contingent ($25 million) and community support for NGOs ($30 million), this brings total Australian support for Rwanda/Burundi to around $74 million.

        It is not possible to estimate accurately the amount of waste dumped, though a considerable volume of soil is contaminated. The waste is not uniformly distributed through the contaminated soil, and the SA Environmental Protection Authority has estimated the amount of contaminated soil on the site at 232,000 tonnes.

        The Government takes this issue very seriously and has appointed the CSIRO to undertake an independent study of contamination at the site. The CSIRO team will evaluate the situation, assess any possible impact upon people living nearby and develop a site remediation plan. As part of the task of providing advice on decontaminating the site I have asked the CSIRO to advise also on the quantity of waste involved.

       ects and related records that were collected by the late Professor Ted Strehlow. Mr Johnson met with the parties affected by the declaration, including Mr Carl Strehlow, Dr Kathleen Strehlow, the Northern Territory (NT) Government and the Central Land Council (CLC), with a view to resolving the matter to the satisfaction of the applicant (the CLC) and myself. Whilst negotiations took place, I made a number of short term declarations, six in all, under s.12 of the Heritage Protection Act to ensure that the Aboriginal objects and related records were protected.

        On 22 December 1994 Mr Johnson reported to me that it had been agreed by the parties that the CLC would purchase the Aboriginal objects from Mr Strehlow, and the NT Government would purchase the related records from Dr Strehlow. Mr Johnson was also able to facilitate agreement on all the terms of the sale, except price.

        After the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's Board of Commissioners decided in February 1995 to provide funds to enable the CLC to purchase the objects, Mr Strehlow and the CLC reached an agreement for the sale of the objects. Following a further approach by myself to Dr Strehlow's solicitors, asking her to accept the NT Government's offer, Dr Strehlow and the NT Government reached an agreement for the purchase of the related records.

        I would also point out that the objects are of crucial importance to the cultural identity, spirituality, and religious beliefs of the Aboriginal people involved. More than 120 senior Aboriginal men were consulted with prior to the purchase, and they identified the objects as being of a secret and sacred nature. The objects were purchased expressly so they could be returned to their traditional custodians. Some of the objects have already been returned, with the remainder being held in trust by the CLC while final arrangements are made for their return.

        In relation to the related records I am advised, that most of the records have been delivered to the Strehlow Research Centre. A list of the remaining records that are a part of the recent agreement with Dr Strehlow is being made and it is expected that those records will be handed over to the Centre in the near future.
