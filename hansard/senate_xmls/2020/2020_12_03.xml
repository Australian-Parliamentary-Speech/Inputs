They cover the same issues that we covered at length yesterday about putting some more checks and balances in the bill, getting clarity and not having the same complete control and power that the minister would have. It's setting in place some guidelines for how decisions are going to be made and setting in place a definition of foreign policy. In the interests of time I won't speak any more about them because I think we canvassed in a lot of detail yesterday the issues they cover.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is to remove a clause from the bill. At the moment, the bill says that the minister is not required to observe any requirements of procedural fairness in exercising a power or performing a function under this act. We think that it is pretty unreasonable. We think that basic legislative standards and common-law standards are that procedural fairness should be allowed. When these bills went to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the committee said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee did not consider that the explanation in the explanatory memorandum as to why procedural fairness should be excluded was at all satisfactory, and we wrote to the minister. We received further information back from the minister and, certainly, having seen that letter, I do not see any further justification as to why procedural fairness should be excluded. The right to procedural fairness is based on two things. It requires that decision-makers aren't biased and do not appear to be biased, and that a person who may be adversely affected by a decision is given an adequate opportunity to put their case before the decision is made. I think these are two very, very basic requirements, and there is no reason why procedural fairness should be excluded in this legislation.</span>

The inclusion of procedural fairness would require the disclosure to a state or territory entity, where there was a likelihood of an adverse decision, of the specific foreign policy matters considered which made the adverse decision likely. It is our view that it is not appropriate for sensitive decisions on foreign policy or foreign relations to be shared. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a well-established principle that information relating to Australia's international or foreign relations is not required to be released, and there are numerous examples of this: the Freedom of Information Act 1982 exempts documents affecting national security, defence or international relations; the Archives Act 1983 provides that access may be refused if releasing the information would damage Australia's security, defence or international relations; and under the Criminal Code there are offences for Commonwealth officers who cause harm to Australia's interests by communicating information that causes harm to Australia's interests, including information that harms or prejudices Australia's international relations. Public interest immunity considerations also include damage to Australia's international relations, particularly in instances where the information relates to exchanges between government officials. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It does not, in our view, make sense and it is damaging to Australia to reverse a longstanding principle in the context of these bills. If the sensitive foreign policy information were excluded from such disclosures, the opportunity for procedural fairness would actually not be meaningful. The exclusion of procedural fairness does not prevent state or territory entities from consulting DFAT in relation to arrangements or relevant policy considerations prior to a formal notification.</span>

The examples that I have just providedâ€”from the FOI Act, from the Archives Act and from the Criminal Codeâ€”go to the seriousness of these issues. We are not talking about basic administrative decisions, Senator. We are talking about decisions in relation to foreign policy and foreign relations.</span>

My understanding is that in the sort of legislation that you were talking aboutâ€”and, indeed, in this legislationâ€”you can have procedural fairness that does not require the disclosure of sensitive information. There was a discussion about this by the Australian Law Reform Commission that basically outlined that procedural fairness is still required, even where sensitive information is not disclosed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this bill passes, the government can basically tear up any agreement between Australian universities and overseas organisations or governments, and those agreements could underpin vital research, which is something that the government doesn't like. It doesn't have to be international interference. It could be cultural issues or joint degreesâ€”any of that. The attitude is, 'Trust us; we don't know what we are going to do with universities yet, but trust us.' I'm sorry; we don't really trust you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the Labor Party have stood here over the past four days saying that universities haven't been consulted. Labor colleagues have waxed lyrical about the importance of consulting and engaging with universities properly. I would plead with you to support these amendments and exclude the universities. Once the government has consulted with the universities, even if you do want them included, maybe think about that later. At this point, we just don't know what the government is going to do. I commend these amendments to the Senate.</span>

When I hear the Greens talk in this chamber I sometimes wonder whether they are really here to represent the Australian people, when all the time they're talking about overseas countries or foreign students, as they are in this case. I wonder if they have really taken the time to speak to the government to understand why the universities have been included in this bill. Have you really followed up to get some understanding about why they are in the bill? </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about national interest, our safety. What we've found is that, even in the case of students, universities are collaborating and working with the Chinese government in research programs. On top of their jobs with universities, they're getting paid up to $150,000. We don't know what they're doing. We've built up our national security in this country in relation to cyberattacks and things like that. It is quite understandable to say that, if any agreements are taken up by universities with other foreign countries, we must know what those agreements are, pure and simple. To drag foreign students into this, saying it is about taking food out of their stomachs, is a load of rubbish as far as I'm concerned. Stick with what this bill is about. If you really care about this country, about the national interest, then you'll stand up and support this bill. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is quite sensible and feasible. We've spoken about private universities being included in this. I suggested to the government that they send a letter to them and invite them to be part of this. A lot of people in the universities don't understand what the government, ASIO or the Federal Police know is going on. They should be working with the foreign affairs department. So I have no problem with it. Instead of whinging and complaining about legislation, how many of you, even on the Labor side, have really taken the time to sit down and talk to the government about their legislation and the impact this is having? This whinging and complaining goes on all the time. Half the time you don't really know the full guts of the bill.</span>

Of course we acknowledge that universities are a major contributor to the Australian economy. That are a major exporter. They have world-class standing and an increasing global posture, which is absolutely welcomed by the government. But it is a complex and contested world, and one of the things that this bill seeks to do is to ensure that we are working together to ensure consistency in foreign policy and foreign relations, because Australian public universities are publicly funded institutions, established by law with a fundamental role in international research and partnerships, because the status of Australian public universities and their international posture means their foreign arrangements do have the potential to impact Australia's foreign relations and foreign policy. It's also the case, thoughâ€”and the government has acknowledged thisâ€”that university arrangements present a lower degree of risk than state and territory arrangements with foreign national governments. So, within the bill, they are designated as non-core arrangements; they are subject to fewer requirements and a lesser degree of scrutiny as a consequence of that. </span>

As I set out yesterday in my discussions in the committee stage with Senator Rice and Senator Wong in particular, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has consulted during many meetings with universities and representative university bodies, and we will continue to work closely with them in the implementation of the bill, should it be passed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was hoping that I wouldn't have to move this amendment, because really universities should be excluded, but now that's not the case. This amendment really is about at least making sure that the larger projects or agreements are the ones that allow the government's broad scope to be looked at by the government. This amendment has a threshold amount of $250,000 for the government to be able to do what they want to do. Like I said: sadly, in the absence of universities being excluded from this legislation, at least this will minimise some of the damage and the harm done to universities and the people who work there. I commend the amendment to the Senate.</span>

The principles of this bill and the motivation behind it are related neither to the monetary value of arrangements such as this nor to the potential impact of the arrangements. It is our view that including a monetary value to limit application of the scheme could potentially allow circumvention of the scheme by breaking projects down into smaller amounts for precisely that reasonâ€”to avoid its applicationâ€”and by masking arrangements with monetary value in subsidiary arrangements, which are not within the scheme unless head arrangements are caught. I also think, from an administrative perspective, it may on occasion be difficult to ascertain the value of certain arrangements, creating uncertainty in the bill's application. I don't think this amendment would go any way to assisting the implementation of the bill at all.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the opportunity for those who have been complaining about the Port of Darwin to actually get some accountability from this government about the 99-year lease, which they have steadfastly refused to be clear about. I would make this point: even yesterday, the minister was unable to give the chamber a clear answer about whether or not the Port of Darwin could be subject to this bill. This bill is, in effect, retrospective, so the minister can veto arrangements which have already been put in place prior to the legislation being passed. When asked about the Port of Darwin, the minister first said that, because it was leased with a private entity, it would be excluded, but then she could not rule out the potential for it to be included within the remit of the legislation, on the basis that there was a subsidiary arrangement and therefore it would be subject to the bill. What this amendment does is require the minister to provide a report. We're not seeking to actually take over the minister's role. We're seeking to ensure that there is transparency around the Port of Darwin lease, that a report be tabled in this chamber that goes to both the effect of the legislation on the lease but, as importantly, the effect of the lease on Australia's foreign policy objectives, which has been the subject of a number of contributions from senators around the chamber. I commend the amendment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  Over the years, I have been consistent in my strident criticisms of the decision to lease the Port of Darwin to Landbridge. How can one of our most strategic assets in northern Australia be leased to a company with ties to the Communist Party in Beijing? There have been long concerns about the decision, attributed to the surveillance and espionage capabilities presented by the port's close proximity to Australian and US defence facilities as well as concerns about the strategic purpose of China's investment in the region as part of its Maritime Silk Road. I know many Australians who have contacted me do not agree, respectfully, with the defence minister's comments on 9 September that there are no security concerns regarding the Port of Darwin. How can this not be a matter of concern? Indeed, I have to say that, after the events of this week, I envisage that there will be renewed focus on the Port of Darwin and it will become very much symbolic of our political fortitude to stand up to the bullying tactics of the CCP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important to highlight some of the aspects of that decision on the Port of Darwin, and they remain perplexing to this day. I know that, after its win in August 2012, the CLP started exploring the privatisation of assets, including the port. There was a process. There were 33 investors, including Australian and European companies, that expressed an interest, including Landbridge. At the time, media reports indicated that Landbridge was a subsidiary of the Shandong Landbridge Group, a private company, and that its 2013 billionaire owner, Ye Cheng, was named by the Chinese government as one of the top 10 individuals caring about the development of national defence. Shandong was found to have extensive links to the CCP and the PLA. Indeed, in an interview in Beijing in 2016, Mr Ye stated: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the Darwin Port investment fit the company's strategy to expand its shipping and energy interests and served China's foreign policy goal known as One Belt, One Road â€¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In February 2015, the Northern Territory assembly appointed the Port of Darwin Select Committee. That committee went through a process. The evidence from that committee also indicated that the federal government had advised the Northern Territory government that the port was better privatised than continuing in government hands. One of the key recommendations in its April 2015 report was that an Australian entity control the lease and that there be FIRB and defence consultations regarding the strategic and security risks of a potential international investor. On 14 September, FIRB contacted Landbridge indicating that the lease was outside the purview of FIRB review because of a technicality that assets owned by state, territory and local governments were exempt from FIRB scrutiny. To this day, that remains the case. The exception has been modified to some extent, but it still remains an issue, and I think that that's something that we should be looking at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in any case, on 13 October Chief Minister Giles announced the 99-year lease valued at $506 million. The lease process raises some legitimate questions as to why, given the lead time to this decision, more effort wasn't made by those in key federal positions and those advising them to remove the foreign investment exemption, given the national security implications of allowing such a critical asset to be handed over to an entity with well-known ties to the CCP and the PLA. We do note that, at the time, the Abbott government was very keen to ensure that a free trade agreement was entered into with China. The Chinese President, on 17 November 2014, addressed a joint sitting and, the day after, the FTA was announced by the trade minister, Andrew Robbâ€”$18 billion. Subsequent to that, Mr Robb left and he took on a job with Landbridgeâ€”$880,000. I will leave it there, but those questions still remain open.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its report after the decision, the Senate Economics References Committee examined a number of issues pertinent to the decision and, in particular, made recommendations regarding that exemption. Peter Jennings, Neil James and others gave evidence. They were very, very critical of the decision. As Peter Jennings said, we would now have to have our national security interests balanced against the reality of operating out of a harbour run by a company whose website proclaims that it is contributing its best to realise the great rejuvenation of the Chinese dream.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were different offers at the time. An ABC report of 12 March 2019 goes back and looks at some of these offers. That article reflects that, whilst Landbridge was the highest offer, the second and third offers were very close thereto. Neil James said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If [Landbridge's] offer was the best offer, but it introduced a major element of strategic risk for the whole country, they should have had the common sense to realise they take the second best offer or the third best offer and not have any strategic risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been consistent on this issue but also on my criticisms of predatory actions by totalitarian regimes and their state owned entities on various issuesâ€”in particular, the acquisition of strategic assets. I have advocated for a major overhaul of critical infrastructure legislation, including retaking the Port of Darwin. As the minister said, there is absolutely no doubt that, were the lease of the port to be considered today, it would be subject to FIRB rules. But I also believe that because the exemption has now been modified, most likely it would be rejected by the Treasurer. However, I am disappointed that the foreign investment changes proposed by the Treasurer, which we will probably be debating shortly in this place, will not allow a retrospective consideration of the port decision. Under FIRB rules, that is not going to be possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of why the lease was signed, there are cogent national security imperatives as to why consideration should be given to breaking the lease. It's obvious from the Northern Territory submission on these bills that there is some contemplation of a re-acquisition. However, I did put specific questions to the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Michael Gunner, which weren't responded to. They very much went to this issue. It would have been useful to have Mr Gunner give evidence, or at least provide responses to those questions, so that we could explore the issues. The only way we are going to explore these issues is with information from the Northern Territory government. So I say to those opposite that a better course of action here would be to seek the cooperation of the Northern Territory government. They have been reluctant in relation to releasing these documents. I would urge those opposite that a better course of action, rather than getting another report here as requested, would be to urge the Northern Territory government to release those documents so that we can make a comprehensive assessment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has answered in the committee stage the very questions that are raised in this amendment. This amendment also raises technical issues, that it's not just actions in the purview of the foreign minister but also actions in the purview of other ministers, including the Treasurer, that will be required to take action. So I believe there is a technical problem with this amendment. I won't repeat my concerns about this bill, which I outlined in the second reading debate. Suffice to say that I believe this amendment will not lead to any report that would be useful. I think that it's a futile exercise, because we already know the outcome, and the outcome is that there will not be a retaking of the Port of Darwin under this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said, there are other opportunities. I have been advised that there are circumstances which may provide cause for the lease to be broken, including a failure by the port operator to meet legislative requirements if the company were to become insolvent, failure to meet defence access requirements and in the event that defence powers are exercised. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Women</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  The government does not support this amendment. We discussed it during the debate in the committee stage for some time yesterday. The government absolutely recognises that foreign investment must be in our national interest. Foreign investment is a vital source of funds to maintain and enhance Australia's infrastructure networksâ€”our assets. Investment in critical assets, however, must not be contrary to the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can confirm to the chamber again that the Port of Darwin arrangement was not covered by the foreign investment regime in 2015. But, given the changes that have been made since 2015 by this government, similar leasing and acquisition proposals would now be covered and would require a formal FIRB process going forward. The Prime Minister repeated in June of this year, during the announcement of the upcoming foreign investment reforms:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Darwin Port was not sold with the approval or authority of the Commonwealth Government. It was not. At that time, sales of assets by Territory governments, state governments, did not require and did not call in the authority of the Foreign Investment Review Board or the Treasurer. As a result of that, I engaged with all the states and territories and had the rules changed and that came into effect in March of 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister has said, the lease decision wasn't solely on the basis of the decision of the Northern Territory government. Of course, that decision could only be explained by the Northern Territory government of the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues in the system that that sale identified were addressed by our governmentâ€”indeed, by the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. In March 2016, the then Treasurer added those additional safeguards to Australia's foreign investment framework. Working with the states and territories, the government amended the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Regulations so that the FIRB would assess the sale of critical state owned infrastructure assets to private foreign investors. In addition, in 2017 the government established the Critical Infrastructure Centre. The centre provides coordinated and comprehensive assessments of national security risks to critical infrastructure in the ports, water, electricity, gas and telecommunications sectors. The centre is also responsible for the administration of the security of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018. That act also established a critical infrastructure assets register, a ministerial last-resort directions power to manage the risks to water, electricity, gas and port assets. These legislative measures must ensure that the government knows who owns and operates our most critical assets and is able to mitigate any identified national security risks. Of course, departments coordinate on this basis: they bring matters of concern to the attention of the Treasurer, who then consults across government, including with my department and, where necessary and appropriate, with the foreign minister on the ramifications for the national security risks identified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous reforms which have been made by the coalition government will both complement and be added to by the comprehensive reforms to the foreign investment review framework, introduced to parliament by the government in October of this year. These are reforms which also address national security risks, including those related to critical infrastructure. They strengthen the existing system, particularly as it relates to compliance by foreign investments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I assure the Senate that the government takes these issues very seriously. We will always act in the national interest, as clearly shown by the development of this foreign relations bill, which will necessarily address a separate, but just as important, gap in our overall system.</span>

I'm not going to speculate, as I have not through this entire debate, on specific examples of particular cases, because that is the purpose of the stocktake. But we are working closely with the states and territories, including the Northern Territoryâ€”who were part of the consultations that I outlined in detail to the chamber yesterdayâ€”in relation to these matters. Once the bill sets out the requirements that the states and territories are required to respond to in the stocktake process and the task force is working with those state and territory agencies, then I would hope and expect that states and territories would work constructively with the Commonwealth to address these issues.</span>

                    </a>  We have written to this minister. We have invited them to negotiate on amendments. There has been silence as a result. She has not had the outcome in the chamber that she wantedâ€”all for want of picking up the phone and actually having a discussion. Now we have, frankly, an absurd proposition that a bill which has been amended to include an annual reportâ€”an uncontroversial amendmentâ€”that would require that report to go to a committee that the government controls, she's now going to oppose. You want a fight when you don't need to have one. There's an annual report that we can send to a references committee. It is a very responsible and sensible amendment to send to a committee the government controls.</span>

I don't think this matter is merely a consequential amendment to the amendment that was agreed by the chamber in relation to the annual report. Of course I accept that that is agreed by the chamber and now forms part of the bill. There is no question in relation to that. If, with the provision of the annual report, the chamber is then minded to refer it to a committee at the time then that will be a matter for the chamber. But this is an order of continuing effect, Senator. It's not a minor amendment and the government doesn't support it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the bill overall, the Greens know that issues of foreign interference are serious. We know that it is far preferable to have the Commonwealth, the states, the territories, universities and local governments, actually working collaboratively and coherently together to make sure that their interactions with foreign governments and foreign universities are in the national interest. The Greens would have supported reasonable legislation that aimed to do thatâ€”legislation that was developed collaboratively and cooperatively, with input from the states, the territories, the universities and local governments, before the legislation was put into this place. But we cannot support this legislation. As I said, this motion is to have an annual report on the legislation. Other than that, this legislation gives unbridled power to the foreign minister. It hasn't been developed in consultation with affected parties; it hasn't got definitions in it; there are no guidelines on how decisions are going to be made as to overriding decisions that sovereign governments have made with foreign entities. There are no reasons for decisions that have to be issued to people who are going to be affectedâ€”who have had their decisions overridden. There is retrospectivity, so that states, territories and universities can enter into arrangements, and at some stage in the future, because foreign policy is deemed to have changed, suddenly their arrangements can be overridden. There is no procedural fairness, as we discussed earlier on today. It has all been, 'Trust us; everything will be fine.' Frankly, we do not trust you. You have form in not being able to be trusted to work cooperatively and genuinely with everyone to make sure things are occurring in the national interest and in the interests of all Australians, not just for your vested interests, not just for the people that you happen to get on with. The Greens, as I said, would have supported legislation that went to the serious issue that we're facing. We are supporting this amendment as one tiny measure, but, overall, we cannot support this legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  Given that we've had a fairly hectic morning here with previous bills, I'm absolutely delighted to be able to get to my feet on behalf of the people of the Northern Territory and speak about a bill of absolute importance in preserving the seat of Solomon and the seat of Lingiari for the people of the Northern Territory. That's what the Electoral Amendment (Territory Representation) Bill 2020 is all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My speech today is really to the people of the Northern Territory and also to the people on Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Thank you for your support in ensuring that we did not lose our voices in the Australian parliament. Many of you provided submissions to the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters and spoke so passionately about the need for democratic fairness and the rights of the Territory and the Indian Ocean Territories to be heard in the House of Representatives, so this speech goes out to you: our First Nations communities; our organisations; our ranger groups; our farmers; the cattle industry; the mining industry; the fishos, amateur and commercial alike; our health workers on the frontline, whether you're working in our hospitals, in our clinics or in the remote and regional areas of the Northern Territory and the Indian Ocean Territoriesâ€”this is about you. It's about your voice. It's about ensuring that the Australian parliament never forgets the people of Lingiari and Solomon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Senate for this opportunity, and I certainly thank colleagues on all sides who've stood very strongly in pursuing this. In particular I thank, in the House, Warren Snowdon, the member for Lingiari, and Luke Gosling, the member for Solomon, and, in the Senate, Senator Sam McMahon. It is important that, no matter our political ideologies, our parties or where we live, we have come together very strongly to say this must not happen, where we lose a voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022 it will be 100 years since the first member for the Northern Territory came into this parliamentâ€”nearly 100 years now. So, nearly a hundred years later, you wanted to keep it at one? It really is a shame job that the Northern Territory has not progressed even more. Two is not enough, but for the purposes of this bill we are enormously grateful that what seemed impossible at the beginning of this year is now becoming very real. I urge all senators to wholeheartedly support the passage of this legislation today, because the people of the Northern Territoryâ€”and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Islandâ€”have many issues to battle. Whether it's the cashless debit card, whether it's the Community Development Program, whether it's jobs and infrastructure or whether it's COVID-19, we want to know that we have voices in this parliament to represent us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This should never have been an issue. It should never have distracted us to the extent it has, but boy am I enormously grateful to those who stood by us to make sure we never gave up on these voices for the Northern Territory and the Indian Ocean Territories. So this Christmas it is, hopefully, an important gift that we can be certain about as we go into next year. Who knows what next year is going to look like? Are we going to have an election next year? It's a big question, isn't it, for 2021? And the people of the Northern Territory and the Indian Ocean Territories want to make sure we have our voices ready to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge a couple of people in particular. I think about the seat of Lingiari. Lingiari, as hopefully everyone does know, comes from the name of Vincent Lingiari, the late Gurindji elder. He fought for land rightsâ€”not just for the Northern Territory but for all First Nations people right across Australiaâ€”and for our country, Australia, to treat First Nations people with the dignity and respect that we have forever been calling for. Dignity and respect come not only in the way we treat one another but in the financial ways in which we treat each other: in the economic cycles, in the ability to have decent homesâ€”families living not 20 to a house but comfortably in one home, knowing they have families in another home, without feeling overcrowded. That's the dignity and respect that Vincent Lingiari stood for, and his message lives on in his children and grandchildren.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was Vincent Lingiari's family that I drove out to. I got in my four-wheel drive and went out to Wave Hill, and I spoke to so many people, all these communitiesâ€”pastoralists, the road workers, the families at Wave Hillâ€”and said: 'Listen, I really need your support here. We have to fight this.' When I got out to Wave Hill, the Gurindji mob got together and we sat down and we talked. I went through and explained: 'This is the Senate. This is how many senators there are. Over here, this is the House. This is how many members there are in the House. And this is us fourâ€”Warren, Luke, Sam and I, four of usâ€”in these two houses of over 200 people.' When I sat down with people and explainedâ€”'This is our voice'â€”they looked at me and they said: 'What? And they want to take one of you away?' They said: 'That's not right. We should have more than that.' And I said, 'Yeah, you're right we should, but we definitely shouldn't be losing any.' So the Gurindji got together and they wrote a letter to the Prime Minister. I'm going to table the letter and just read a little bit of it because I think it's important to acknowledge what the children and grandchildren of Vincent Lingiari did on this particular occasion:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Prime Minister,</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are the grandchildren of Vincent Lingiari. In 2000, we gave permission for the Australian Electoral Commission to use our grandfather's name for the electorate of Lingiari. We were proud to see the achievements of Vincent Lingiari and the Gurindji people recognised in this way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Now, the Australian Electoral Commission has declared the Northern Territory will lose a seat in the Federal Parliament at the next election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Losing a seat will make our voices softer not louder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Government talks about Closing the Gap and a First Nations voice yet in the Northern Territory, where almost 30% of the population are Aboriginal, we are losing our voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fight for Land Rights began here on Gurindji country. Our Grandfather Vincent Lingiari fought against power and privilege for the betterment of our people, and all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We'd love to welcome you, as our Prime Minister â€¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, they've actually invited not only the Prime Minister but probably most senators and members at some point to come to Wave Hill and walk. I know that Senator Penny Wong has spent time with me out there walking the walk and talking the talk on the importance of what the legacy of Vincent Lingiari is aboutâ€”the fight against power and privilege. The Gurindji hold that flame so strongly, as they do here in this legislation before the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm enormously proud that, through the combined efforts of so many, we stand here to do the right thing, to make sure the voices of the people of the Northern Territory and the people of the Indian Ocean Territories grow louder in strength, not softer. Bauji Barra.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  I rise on behalf of the Greens speak to the Electoral Amendment (Territory Representation) Bill 2020. This is a really exciting day and we hope for these reforms to be passed today. With that in mind, I intend to keep my remarks nice and short because we're coming up against the motions hard marker at 11.45 am.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really pleased that we are here today. People will recall that the history of this reform. The AEC, based on small population changes in the Territory, ruled that there was to be only one lower house seat to cover the whole Territory rather than the current two. In a very welcome display of chamber unity, we saw both Senator McCarthy and Senator McMahon sponsor a bill to fix that situation, to restore the right to two seats for the Territory and to ensure that the voices of First Nations people wouldn't be further downgraded in this system that has already underdelivered so much. It was a little bit awkward, because the government didn't actually want Senator McMahon to be collaborating. Through discussions behind closed doors, that bill was withdrawn. But I'm really pleased that the government has now put its own version on the table. We don't actually mind whose name is on the front page; the important outcome is that now we will see that two seats in the lower house will be restored for the Northern Territory and also for the ACT. The way it will do that is slightly different to the original bill. It was suggested by Antony Green to use a harmonic mean. The end result is a strong one. At least two seats will be guaranteed, with the possibility of more going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We strongly support this bill. I want to particularly congratulate the efforts of Senator McCarthy and Senator McMahon in pushing this issue, which has led to this excellent outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have just a few more comments to make. I think everybody understands that the seat of Lingiariâ€”which Senator McCarthy has so beautifully given us the history ofâ€”is made up of 40 per cent First Nations people. What an affront to potentially have had that seat abolished. When 27 per cent of the population of the Northern Territory are First Nations people and 40 per cent are in the seat of Lingiari, and when we already see a system here that has so far been pretty deaf to the needs of First Nations people, that would have just been adding insult to injury.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue is the downgrading of regional and rural issues. In proposing to amalgamate it with an urban seat, the seat of Solomon concentrated around Darwin, you would have seen those rural and regional issues again further diluted, with an inevitable focus on urban issues at the expense of those rural and regional areas where 40 per cent are First Nations voters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are thrilled to be supporting this bill today. This is a crucial time in our nation's history. Our relationship with the first peoples of this country remains a festering sore that we here could and should be doing so much better on. Our newest Greens senator, Lidia Thorpe, gave a very powerful first speech last night when she talked to these issues in a way that I hope made everyone feel proud and hopeful for the potential for these issues to be resolved. We need to work on treaties, we need to recognise sovereignty, we need a voice to parliament, we need truth-telling, we need justice, we need healing and we need reparations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To have abolished a seat that was 40 per cent First Nations would have been going in the absolute wrong direction, so the Greens are really pleased to support this bill today which will see the voices of First Nations people maintained. We share Senator McCarthy's view that in fact they should be elevated. We look forward to working on those issues going forward. Thanks again to Senator McCarthy and Senator McMahon for the initial strong move that has culminated in the government's bill today. Well done to the government for actually coming to the table.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  I am very pleased to support the Electoral Amendment (Territory Representation) Bill 2020. I'm pleased with this outcome not only as the assistant minister responsible for electoral matters but also as a senator for the ACT, one of the jurisdictions that is affected by this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know concerns were raised on sheer geography. It was pointed out that the new division of the Northern Territory would constitute one-sixth of Australia's total land mass, equal in size to the area of France, Spain and Italy put together. If it were a country, it would have been the 20th largest in the world. Notwithstanding the fact that geography is always an issue when it comes to electorates, the real concern is that we have evolved a system that could be considered, in some cases, unduly harsh, unfair and unrepresentative against that backdrop. In essence, a reduction of a relatively minor margin in voters can result in a massive reduction in representation for those areas. In the Northern Territory, dropping below the quota would result in representation being reduced by half. It also exaggerates the differences between populations per representative. For example, the Northern Territory with one representative would have a population 74,743 greater than other mainland divisions, 139,878 greater than a Tasmanian division and 100,529 more than a division in the ACT. As further illustration, adding one seat in Victoria reduces the average population per member from around 175,000 to 170,500, a difference of only about 4,500. By comparison, dropping one seat in the ACT changes the population per member from 143,186 to 214,780, a difference of 71,594. In the Northern Territory, dropping a seat creates a difference of over 123,000 votes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These risks are not just hypothetical. They are historical facts. In 2003 the Northern Territory's population fell just 294 short of the required quota, yet it threatened to take their representation down to just one seat. This resulted in amendments to electoral legislation that took into account statistical errors in population estimates. The use of the margin-of-error calculation did indeed keep a second seat for the Northern Territory in 2004, but it was a solution built on the acceptance of statistical error as a legitimate tool for representation and it did not address the issue of aligning the number of voters per electorate as closely as possible between crowded city electorates and sprawling regional ones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question then was how to create an electoral system that was fair and representative across the whole of our nation but also reasonable and robust as a matter of electoral mathematics. There was the option of simply mandating a minimum number of seats, which was put to this parliament. Upon closer examination, that simplicity is also a flaw. While simple, that option does not fully discharge our responsibility to deliver, as far as possible, the best, principled basis for determining seats for representation. A politically mandated number could easily be seen as arbitrary, and certainly not in the spirit of the founding of our nation nor the interests of finding a genuinely robust methodology. This very point was raised during the 2004 debates when Warren Snowden warned that such a path could:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ undermine the credibility of the Electoral Act and which would create a precedent for future governments to intervene in a very political and partisan way â€¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a wise warning, and it's worthy of serious consideration. It's also a two-edged sword. Mandating a minimum seat number regardless of how low population actually falls could result in the perverse outcome of an electorate being massively over-represented. In either case, there are issues that need to be addressed. That's why, after consultation with colleagues and submissions from stakeholders, another method was considered and is included in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill proposes the adoption of the harmonic mean, or Dean's method, as a fairer, more robust and more reliable solution than others proposed so far. As Antony Green advocated in his submission on this matter, the adoption of the harmonic mean both protects the people of the territories and provides a legitimate, principle-based solution going forward. It removes the harshness and inequity of knife-edge differences in population creating massive drops in representation. It removes the requirement for statistical errors to be included as a safety net to overcome more fundamental flaws in our electoral calculations. It is a system designed to keep the voter-per-member average in smaller population areas more closely aligned with the national average, something Antony Green notes is not a property of the existing method.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only am I pleased with the solution proposed as a legitimate, tested and supported solution for all Australians, it's also a sound result for the Australian Capital Territory. Though smaller in size, the ACT does face the same vagaries in terms of outcomes. Despite our population, the ACT was only granted a third seat based on the margin-of-error calculation. According to Antony Green's submission, using the proposed harmonic mean would have given the ACT a third seat for 1993, 1998, 2001, 2004 and 2016, in each case applying the same rules that would apply to the Northern Territory. It is this issue of equal treatment between the territories that has raised concerns not only in the pursuit of electoral fairness but also to ensure it is fair to the ACT as well as to the Northern Territory. As Senator for the ACT I'm very pleased with where we've gotten to. I contrast this with the proposal that was supported by Labor representatives for the ACT. The bill included in its title the words, 'Ensuring Fair Representation for the Northern Territory'; it didn't give the same fairness to the ACT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After that bill was referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, this issue became abundantly clear. The committee's report notes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The private Senators' Bill would introduce a new minimum of two seats for the Northern Territory but would keep the Australian Capital Territory, uniquely, on the lower one seat floor. 1.80 This would institute a two-tier arrangement for minimum Territory representation, rather than modelling the section on the constitutional treatment of Original States whereby all Original States are treated with parity. It would also be a departure from existing electoral arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It further notes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By having separate minimum entitlement provisions treating each Territory differently, the Bill departs from this longstanding position, raising parity, equity and, conceivably, constitutional concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦Â Â Â â€¦Â Â Â â€¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Notwithstanding whether this may give rise to legal issues, the Committee considers that on principle alone there ought to be parity in the treatment of the two Territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a sentiment with which I wholeheartedly agree. Clearly, Labor, including Senator Gallagher, Andrew Leigh, Alicia Payne and David Smith, supported a solution which would have treated the ACT differently and at a significant relative disadvantage to the Northern Territory. Their proposal was far more favourable to the NT as against the Australian Capital Territory. This disparity guaranteed two seats for the Northern Territory but only one for the ACT. This is not only unfair to the people of the ACT, it raises constitutional issues of treating voters differently in different jurisdictions. As I said, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters made this point in a very sound way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I would note that the bill before us today removes the margin-of-error rule as it is applied to the ACT and the Northern Territory. This rule was arguably only affixed for a specific fault at the time. With better systems, those reasons no longer apply. Far more importantly, the system proposed does not need a second safety net, and certainly not one based on codifying a margin of error as a permanent part of our electoral system. As I've said and welcomed, our electoral systems are vital to our democracy, and faith in that system from the public is dependent on the good faith of negotiations undertaken by this parliament. I believe the bill before us today is a demonstration of that commitment and that good faith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters, I applaud the hard work and rigour that colleagues and commentators have brought to this discussion. As a local representative for the ACT, I'm very pleased to champion and deliver a system that gives fair representation to both territories: the ACT and the Northern Territory. As a parliamentarian, I welcome a system of fairer representation for all Australians, whether here in the seat of government in the ACT or in the heart of our country in the Northern Territory. I thank everyone who contributed to the development of the bill, and I commend it to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  Labor welcomes this Electoral Amendment (Territory Representation) Bill 2020, which will ensure that the Northern Territory retains two seats in the House of Representatives. Of course, this bill is in response to Labor's original bill introduced by Senator Malarndirri McCarthy earlier this year, which I was a proud co-sponsor of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the introduction of our bill in June, my Labor colleagues in the Northern Territoryâ€”Luke Gosling, Warren Snowdon and Senator McCarthyâ€”have fought to ensure that the voices of Territorians are not diminished by having the Territory reduced to one enormous electorate. This bill is the outcome of a sustained campaign. We were able to secure the support of the CLP's Senator McMahon, the Greens, the crossbench, the Northern Territory government, the Northern Territory opposition and even the National Party to ensure that the government was forced to deal with this issue. I'd like to thank all of my Senate colleagues and colleagues in the other place for their support of this bill. I'd also like to thank the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Michael Gunner; the ALP national secretary, Paul Erickson; and the ALP NT secretary, Anthony Brereton, for all their hard work and commitment to securing the Territory's representation. I extend my thanks and appreciation to the Labor members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Mattersâ€”Senator Carol Brown, Milton Dick, Senator Marielle Smith and Kate Thwaitesâ€”for the time and effort they put into the inquiry on this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was no accounting for community interestâ€”that is, what the people in remote and regional communities need and how different it is from what the people of Darwin and Palmerston need. There was no accounting for demographyâ€”that is, the fact that First Nations Australians make up about 30 per cent of the Territory's population. There's only one thing that the AEC can look at, and that's population. On those figures, the Northern Territory fell short of retaining its two seats by around 4,000 people. Labor couldn't stand by and let the Territory representation diminish. The government wasn't acting to save the Northern Territory's second seat, so we in Labor introduced our own piece of legislation. The bill that the government introduced isn't exactly what Labor would have done, but it does fix the problem. And, instead of enacting JSCEM's third recommendationâ€”which is to change the method by which both territories are entitled to a determinationâ€”it uses a method that we didn't advocate but that does the job of fixing the issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many others have spoken about the various details of the bill, so I won't go over that again. The bill also sets aside the AEC's most recent determination in relation to the Northern Territory. The determination made in 2017, which allocated two seats to the Northern Territory, will apply. I met with the Electoral Commissioner earlier this week, and he confirmed to me that the current boundaries of Solomon and Lingiari will remain unchanged and there will be no requirement for a further redistribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My first visit to the Northern Territory was some 44 years ago, to help Darwin rebuild after the cyclone, and I've made countless trips there ever since. Working with my Labor colleagues in the Northern Territory to help secure this important change has been an honourâ€”and, particularly, working with Senator McCarthy on this issue. Passion and dedication have been the driving forces behind this campaign. Labor has always been committed to ensuring all Territorians continue to have fair representation in our federal parliament. We are glad that the government has come on board. I thank the former minister, Minister Cormann, and Minister Birmingham for the respectful way in which they've handled this issue. This is a win for democracy, and we're all pleased to support this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I rise to speak on this historic and important piece of legislation, the Electoral Amendment (Territory Representation) Bill 2020. It's historic and important not just to the Northern Territoryâ€”although that is obviously where my passion liesâ€”but also to the ACT, because this bill includes not just the Northern Territory but our other territory, right here around our nation's capital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why is this important to Territorians? Around the rest of Australia, if you suggested to a lot of people that you should take away a politician or two, they would probably say that that's a good thing. That's not so in the Territory. We, obviously, as a territory, have only two senators, and we have two lower house membersâ€”four representatives to the federal parliament for the whole of the Territory. So Territorians are very well aware of their need for federal representation. They're very well aware of the role that the federal government plays. They're well aware that Labor, in the Northern Territory, has sent us broke and that if we were a company we would be bankrupt. So they're well aware of the need for the federal government to provide for the programs, the services and the infrastructure that Territorians need. If we look just at the geography of the Northern Territory, at almost 1.4 million square kilometres it's absolutely huge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been said by my colleagues, it also includes Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) islands. To get to these islands, one must actually travelâ€”and one did, pre-COVID, as well; this has not been affected by COVIDâ€”via Perth or via Malaysia. I don't imagine there are too many other jurisdictions in the world where you not only have to leave your state or territory but actually to travel through another country to get to another part of your state or territory. It's unique and quite amazing. I know the people of Christmas and Cocos islands value their federal representation and they, feeling so isolatedâ€”as they are, sitting out there in the middle of the oceanâ€”realise that, with less representation, they're hardly ever going to see anybody ever. For a group of people who are fairly marginalised and very isolated, you can imagine that that is not something that they would welcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the rest of the Territory, as I said, it's almost 1.4 million square kilometres and very, very difficult to get around. We have very few roads. Most of the roads that we do have can be cut off, sometimes for large parts of the year. A lot of them are fairly poor and not very easily passed. A lot of the Territory you can't even get to by road for large parts of the year, sometimes even all year. We have quite a few islands as well, such as Groote Eylandt, Croker Island, Melville Island and Bathurst Island, accessible only via barge or air, and, again, difficult and time-consuming to get around. You can imagine that taking one of four representatives out of that mix is going to mean that these people are not going to be able to see or speak to a federal representative or show them their part of the world and their issues, or hardly ever, which would be quite a negative thing for, again, people who are often the most disadvantaged, marginalised people in our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the two electorates, Solomon and Lingiari. They are very, very different. Solomon is basically Darwin. Darwin is a reasonably modern, cosmopolitan, urbanised city these days, and then you have Lingiari, which is all of the restâ€”basically, almost all of those 1.4 million square kilometres. Lingiari is approximately 40 per cent Indigenousâ€”again, some of the most isolated, disadvantaged and marginalised people in the world. Having only one federal representative to serve them would be quite unfair and, quite frankly, disastrous for the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, if we look at the socioeconomics, I know there are both ends of the spectrum in every state and territory, but it was certainly typified to me how much that is so in the Territory just last week. I was sitting in a building in Darwin which had lovely 360-degree views all around the harbour and the city with three of the richest people in the Northern Territory. We're talking billions, not millions here. Typically, when you think of someone who is wealthy in the Territory it's someone who can buy a round without taking out a bank loan! But that isn't the case with these people; we had billions of dollars assembled in that room. The very next day, I was sitting in the dirt north of Tennant Creek with a group of traditional owners. We say 'traditional owners', but they don't have the money, the land, the businesses or the education of the three men I was with the day before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's very typical of the Territory. We tend to get extremes, and lots of people at those extremes. Those traditional owners who were sitting there in the dirt were getting part of their traditional land handed back to themâ€”600 square kilometres, which is not a lot, particularly in that part of the country. In that part of the country, 600 square kilometres would probably run 10 head of cattle, so it's not a lot. But they were happy that it was getting handed back to them. So I was sitting there in the dirt with severely marginalised and disadvantaged people, compared with the big end of town. Whilst there are extremes in all jurisdictions, that is certainly emphasised in the Territory, and we have a lot of our population at the lower extreme rather than at the top extreme. These people value their representationâ€”they really do. People in remote Indigenous communities think it's a great honour and they're very happy when a federal representative, of whatever persuasion, comes to see them. They really do appreciate it; they put time aside and they want to talk to you about their issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank senator James McGrath, the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, for the work that he and the committee did on this inquiry and the report from that, which was handed up to the Senate this week and which recommended a couple of different methods by which we might maintain representation. I'm very pleased that this bill enshrines in law the use of the harmonic meanâ€”otherwise referred to as Dean's methodâ€”for determining representation, as that will not only guarantee that the NT retains its two seats currently but also make it easier, as our population grows, for us to move from two up to three. I think this is an excellent resolution. I'm very, very proud to be part of the government that has put this bill forward. I thank all my colleagues, and I thank former Senator Cormann for the work that he did on it and also Senator Birmingham for taking over and carrying on that work, presenting us with a very good piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge Senators Farrell and McCarthy for their supportâ€”for working with me and for their faith in me and the government to deliver on this. With great pride, and on behalf of all Territorians I commend this legislation to the Senate.</span>

In particular, I thank Senator McMahon for her advocacy and thoughtful engagement. I acknowledge Senator McCarthy and Senator Farrell. I also acknowledge Senator Seselja, noting the broader territory implications of the engagement through the debate and the construction of this legislation. I also thank the JSCEM for their thoughtful work and engagement through this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I shall let the details of the bill stand, noting the time, aside from noting that many other members of the parliament have followed this matter closely and are conscious of ensuring a principled approach in relation to how such matters are handled. The use of a harmonic mean calculation for allocating seats to the territories addresses the types of concerns that had been raised in relation to territory representation and does so through means that maintain principles around the application of electoral redistributions. It also ensures that this parliament is not in and of itself overreaching in the construction of the House of Representatives but that a methodology is applied according to principles consistent with how the House of Representatives is intended to be constructed in terms of determining numerical representation of those seats. We welcome the fact that the result of that approach and the decisions made in this legislation will ensure that at the next election, and based on projections beyond that, the Territory will continue to have two representatives in the House of Representatives and in doing so will not find itself in a situation of having the single-largest electorate, potentially, when you combine population, geography and all the challenges that would come with effective representation in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that there's been conjecture in parliamentary committee hearings about the future status of the Australian Electoral Officer for the Northern Territory, and I take this opportunity to put those concerns to rest. The bill recognises that the Australian Electoral Officer in the NT is always to be a member of the redistribution committee for any redistributions in that territory and, for the record, that the process to permanently refill the AEO position for the NT will begin before the end of 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I remind everyone that it's important that we remain committed to improving electoral legislation in a nonpartisan manner that promotes public confidence and ensures strong representation for Australia's territories. We've seen elsewhere in the world in recent times the challenges that can come when politicians undermine public confidence in electoral systems. It's incumbent on all of us to make sure that it is upheld at the highest possible levels. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

The Greens will be moving amendments to this bill. Instead of extending the operation of section 24JAA by another 10 years, as the government has proposed, we are proposing to extend it by only one more year instead. In our view, the minister has not made the case for why a 10-year extension is required. Remember that this isn't just about building public homes. The government could also build police stations in communities that are already overtargeted by police and apparently do this for their benefit. I know from personal experience that, for our people, having police as first responders is often not helpful but harmful, and sometimes lethal.</span>

They would also be properly funding native title claimants to properly negotiate on an equal footing with the government, as well as funding them to develop community-led land use plans over their country. Most importantly, they would be bending over backwards, just like they do for their big corporate mates, to protect our heritage. Every time the Minerals Council comes knocking on these doors, the government get themselves tied up in knots and do whatever it wants. If only they listened toâ€” </span>

I just wanted to place on the record that the Corporations Amendment (Corporate Insolvency Reforms) Bill 2020 does propose to ease the regulatory burden on businesses. I note that we regulate businesses for many reasons, including to protect our environment and to provide safer workplaces for people, and, ultimately, we regulate businesses in the public interest.</span>

We've beaten our 2020 target by 459 million tonnes and we are on track to meet our 2030 target. Australians are also deploying renewable energy at 10 times the global per-person average. These are achievements Australians can and should be proud of, but climate change is a global problem requiring global action. That's why Australia has committed to the Paris Agreement.

                  </a>  One Nation does not support this motion. Australia's Chief Scientist stated that, if Australia were to reduce its entire carbon dioxide output to zero, it would have virtually no effect on the global temperature. It's time that the Liberal-National and Labor-Greens parties acknowledge that implementing layer upon layer of destructive climate policies and renewable energy schemes cannot change the global climate. If people were serious about reducing the world's carbon dioxide output, they would be pressuring China, which accounts for 30 per cent of the world's output and renegotiated its Paris Agreement, allowing China to increase output until 2030 and then only slow the increase. There is no agreement. Yes, you heard that right: China will be increasing its carbon dioxide output for the foreseeable future, while climate policies here in Australia decimate our economy. What's more, we are subsidising China to build the appliances that will be installed here and will raise our electricity prices. This is insane.</span>

The Morrison government did not hesitate in providing support for this critical industry, with an unprecedented package of broad economic and targeted industry support. In addition to JobKeeper, this includes small business grants and funding for airlines, zoos and aquariums, and national parks. Tasmania is also receiving $13Â½ million through the recovery of regional tourism package, an acknowledgement of the state's critical reliance on international tourism. With regard to skills, our JobMaker plan includes a billion dollar JobTrainer fund with skills and training crucial to Australia's economic recovery. The government will provide around $131.3 million to Tasmania over four years through the NASWD, supporting skills development. This funding is for Tasmania to run its training system including TAFEs.</span>

Australia needs to make clear to the Israeli government that increasing settlement-building and the threat of annexation, not to mention the regular demolition of Palestinian homes, are massive obstacles to achieving peace. We urge the government to finally recognise a Palestinian state, as so many other countries have done.</span>

Labor will not be supporting this motion, because we support science and we support scientists and the work that they do. We do acknowledge that the more extreme elements that appeared earlier this week in Senator Rennick's motion, referring to 'indoctrination, intimidation and shoddy mathematical modelling' have disappeared, but the fact this this motion appears today reflects poorly on the government and shows their inability to contain the frequent and getting-more-erratic outbursts from Senator Rennick. Whilst you're trying to make it look perfectly reasonable, we will not support it. We on this side of the chamber will not be providing the senator with more ammunition in his crusade against science.</span>

Senator Rennick is a climate denialist and he wants to challenge other science that he happens to not agree with. The subtext of what he is trying to say here is that climate science isn't legitimate science, and he's undermining the excellent, high-quality work of climate scientists around the world and here in Australia. The Greens support science. We support the science that is done here and the quality climate science as is reflected by the excellent work done by the international panel on climate change. The government needs to act rather than to fiddle around with Senator Rennick's climate denialism. It needs to act on our climate crisis and act on the good science that our climate scientists do around the world.</span>

Farmers lost the right to manage their land and vegetation without compensation. The purchase of freehold land has been turned into a leasehold agreement, with government controlling the land use through overburdensome and crippling regulations. The decision by the Howard government to steal property rights without compensation remains to this day an unjust and morally reprehensible decision that the Morrison government refuses to reverse.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to supporting individuals, families and the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing financial assistance to people who lose their jobs or have reduced income as a result of the outbreak.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also committed to ensuring fiscal responsibility, by adjusting temporarily increased levels of support. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is actively monitoring economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and is responding by continuing assistance for individuals and families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government thanks the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for its report on this Bill and its recommendation that this Bill be passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government notes the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens commented on an ongoing increase to JobSeeker Payment. As the Government has previously indicated, we are focused on the immediate issue at hand, which is outlining and providing the next stage of temporary social security supports to Australians as we transition to a post-COVID economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens also recommend a further waiver of the Liquid Assets Test Waiting Period. Successive Governments have always been clear that people should rely on their own resources before calling on the community for support. As the health and economic situation improves, it is no longer appropriate to continue to waive the Liquid Assets Test Waiting Period. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government rejects the Greens comment that the Coronavirus Supplement should be paid at a rate of $550 a fortnight. While there remains uncertainty around economic conditions, there are signs of improvement and confidence is increasing. The Government considers support at $150 a fortnight is appropriate as the economy starts to open up and people have capacity to take up work to support themselves. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To date, temporary measures have been successful in supporting Australians through economic shock and uncertainty, but challenging conditions continue. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill responds to the continuing uncertainty around economic conditions in Australia by extending temporary financial support, through the Coronavirus Supplement and other temporary eligibility and access measures, mostly until 31 March 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill permanently repeals provisions providing temporary exemptions to the assets tests. These exemptions were put in place as part of the initial package of Coronavirus Economic Response measures in March 2020 and are no longer necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also introduces a discretionary power under the social security and veterans' entitlements assets tests to extend the principal home temporary absence provisions. This provision is beneficial as it prevents the inclusion of the principal home in the assets test while a person is unable to return to Australia within the allowable absence period, due to circumstances beyond their control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 11 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Coronavirus Economic Response Package Omnibus Act 2020</span> included a power that allowed the Minister to temporarily modify social security law to respond to circumstances relating to COVID-19 by making a disallowable legislative instrument. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This broad power that allowed the Minister to modify (or vary) any qualification or rate in social security law was critical in allowing the Government to respond flexibly to emerging situations, amend the partner income test for JobSeeker Payment and apply changes that aided Services Australia in quickly addressing the large volume of claims received in March and April 2020. The Minister's power to make these modifications will be automatically repealed on 31 December 2020 and instruments made under the modification power will no longer have any effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill introduces a new, diminished and time-limited instrument-making power, allowing the Government to respond flexibly to any changes in circumstances which might arise as a result of COVID-19 in the first quarter of next year, while Parliament may not be sitting. The temporary power will operate until 31 March 2021.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current powers in social security law that enable the Minister to set the rate and duration of the Coronavirus Supplement and the related exemptions from waiting and preclusion periods will remain in place until 31 March 2021.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  I continue my contribution to the debate on the Native Title Amendment (Infrastructure and Public Facilities) Bill 2020. If only they listened to our mobs in the way that they say they do, because then we wouldn't have to go to court to fight tooth and nail to protect our heritage, just as we have been doing on Djab Wurrung country. Today Justice Forbes handed down her decision on the injunction application by Djab Wurrung people to have their sacred birthing trees protected. This is a welcome decision for the Djab Wurrung mob. We shouldn't have to go to court to fight for country over and over again. If only governments would listen to our people and work with us, we wouldn't have to be in the Supreme Court arguing. If this country valued its First Peoples then we wouldn't have to be in court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why we will vote against this bill today. The Greens know that this bill doesn't extinguish native title, but it does extinguish our people's sovereignty. The Greens know that this bill doesn't extinguish native title and this breach of the right of our people to get free, prior and informed consent will not be supported by the Greens. The minister has not made a strong enough case for extending this legislation for another 10 years, when this government has been in government for seven of those years. As our amendments to this bill show, we are willing to give them one more year to come back and properly make the case to us as to why this section is needed. If this section weren't in the Native Title Act, it would rightly be condemned for being racist, because the government is trying to acquire interest over the property on Aboriginal territory without due process of payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's bill leaves native title owners with infrastructure built on their land, which is allegedly for their benefit, but they have no control over it. This is shameful and we will not support it. Our amendment would give the government one year. If they cannot justify to the parliament in one year why they need this change to section 24JAA then that section must lapse.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Native Title Amendment (Infrastructure and Public Facilities) Bill 2020 is about having government properties on Aboriginal land. It's a sneaky way to continue the oppressive nature of this government. They want to continue the control of Aboriginal people and take away our sovereign rights in this country. Being allowed to build police stations in communities that the government own and control and continue to oppress us with is against our basic human rights and against self-determination. And it puts the fear into our people to continue to be profiled and harassed by police in their own homes and their own communities. We've seen only recently a death in custody as a result of a government owned police station on Aboriginal land.</span>

It has taken way too long to get here. There has been unimaginable hurt created because the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments have taken way too long to act on something that should have been done and dusted in a day. I've stood in this place and seen legislation go through both houses in one day. This bill, which deals with discrimination against de facto couples in WA over years and years, has taken a very long time. Of course, the discrimination has been particularly against women. As we know, women have much lower superannuation balances, and de facto couples, when they've chosen to separate, have not been able to legally split their superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one person who's been central to holding this upâ€”that is, the member for Pearce, Mr Christian Porter, who, ironically, was Attorney General in the WA state parliament and is now Attorney-General in this place. The bill has sat with him for a very long time, and he must have been aware of this issue. I've got my good friend Rachel Roberts to thank for telling me about this six years agoâ€”six years ago!â€”when the Barnett government refused to do anything about the splitting of superannuation for de facto couples. I thank Rachel for being so steadfast in making sure we dealt with this issue. I also thank John Quigley, Labor's Attorney General in the state parliament, for urging the Attorney-General, Mr Christian Porter, who's absolutely central to this, to act so that finally the superannuation of those de facto couples in Western Australia who, unfortunately, split up will be treated in exactly the same way as that of all other de facto couples across this country. I have no idea why the Attorney-General chose to sit on this legislation for more than a yearâ€”to sit on a bill that's not controversial and that deals with discrimination in Western Australia against de facto couples who are separatingâ€”and I'm really pleased that the bill is finally before the Senate.</span>

I'd very much like to support the comments that Senator Lines has just made. Anybody who pays attention to these issues in WA knows that this has been a very significant issue for a very long time and it's way beyond time that it was dealt with. The bill deals with an anomaly whereby womenâ€”and it's nearly always the women who sufferâ€”were not being treated fairly and equally, so it is long past due and I'm really pleased that it has finally come to the top of the list. I'd also like to give a shout-out to the women who have been emailing to urge that this be done. Thank you for keeping it on the agenda. I think you'll all finally be very, very happy that this bill is about to pass.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:49</span>):  Back in 2001, Western Australia was the first place in the countryâ€”because the rest of the nation was covered by the federal Family Law Actâ€”to do law reform so that couples in de facto relationships, be they same-sex or opposite sex, could split their assets. In 2008, federal Labor also did superannuation splitting as part of its de facto law reform. But it has taken until 2020â€”because Western Australia is not part of the federal Family Law Actâ€”for de facto couples now to be able to split their superannuation. I cannot begin to tell you of the injustices that have been done in that time because of the lack of capacity for people to split their assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A constituent wrote to me, pleading with the parliament to make sure that this gets passed. She had been paying most of the household bills, and her partner at the time had said to her: 'Look, this is great. Because you're paying the bills out of your salary, I can afford to pay more into my super so that we can have a happy, full and rich retirement.' So that is what they, as a couple, did. But what happens when they're before the Family Court? Even if they had wanted to split their assets amicably, when a lot of the assets were in superannuation the failure to act on law reform in this area meant that they could not. This has left hundreds, if not thousands, of people worse off than they otherwise would have been if they had been able to split their assets fairly, including superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Porter said that this was urgent 12 months ago. I don't think the fact that it is now in this place some 12 months later reflects that urgency, but I will make these remarks short because I believe it is urgent that the bill passes today.</span>

It's very disappointing that this government is doing so little to help Australian tradies.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  I seek to speak on the Native Title Amendment (Infrastructure and Public Facilities) Bill 2020. Labor does not support the amendment being proposed. When Labor introduced these measures back in 2010, we did so with great care, following extensive consultations with First Nations communities. While the provisions have been used sparingly over the decade, they have been in force. They have been a useful means to help facilitate the building of necessary facilities on land subject to native title. We support their extension for a further ten years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That being said, we in Labor share some of the concerns raised about the way in which facilities built on Indigenous lands are managed. These were outlined by the shadow assistant minister for reconciliation in his speech in the second reading debate on the bill. In particular, it is essential that proper good-faith consultations take place with affected communities. The legal framework contains a number of safeguards outlined to ensure this occurs. This includes requiring consultation to take place at the request of affected parties. It also includes granting the Attorney-General the ability to prescribe how consultations with native title parties should occur and put in place specific requirements that can be tailored to a particular community. These provisions for consultation are an essential part of Labor's original design for subdivision JA. It's important that this subdivision continues to be used only when strictly necessary to facilitate urgent construction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to reiterate our calls for the government to ensure that, at all times, it deals with First Nations communities in a consultative manner so as to ensure that any facilities built under subdivision JA of the Native Title Act are managed in a manner that is appropriate and respectful to those communities before, during and after construction.</span>

The reason the government don't support the one-year extension is that we don't believe it will provide certainty to communities or to state governments and it has the risk of delaying critical public infrastructure on Indigenous lands for the benefit of Indigenous Australians. We think that the bill still does retain the temporary status of the provision, but it does so for a time period that allows certainty and continued support through infrastructure for the benefit of Indigenous Australians.</span>

That's been the overwhelming purpose for using itâ€”for residential properties and public housing. But you can be assured that the measure is used only sparingly.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  Labor welcomes these recycling and waste reduction bills. We generate 67 million tonnes of waste a year and a large portion of that waste is recyclable. On a per capita basis, we generate more than a hundred kilograms of plastic each and every year, yet we recycle barely 12 per cent of that waste. We're not alone in having that problem. Globally, more than 10 million tonnes of plastic finds its way into the oceans every year, and that is only expected to grow. Some estimates are that it will triple in the next 20 yearsâ€”wrap your minds around that proposition. We are going to need to come to grips with this as a parliament, as a country and, frankly, as a planet, because the environmental effects of large amounts of plastic entering the ecosystem are stark and well understood. Everyone has seen the horrific photos of the impact on wildlifeâ€”turtles with straws, birds that have ingested large amounts of plasticâ€”and we're confronted by the visible reminders of our waste habits when we see the debris in our creek beds and the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which swirls around in the ocean environment that we inhabit. The evidence for the impact on human health is growing. We know that microplastics have entered marine ecosystems and are accumulating in the food chain, with uncertain effects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our current practices are not sustainable in any sense of the word. Limited materials are sunk into ultradisposable productsâ€”many of them have a life span of minutes before being thrown awayâ€”and there is no doubt that the best future for Australia and for the world lies in building a more circular economy, where materials are seen as a resource to use minimally and to reuse and recycle to the maximum extent possible. There's a strong economic incentive to act. In addition to being environmentally responsible, it allows the prospect of creating new resource recovery and manufacturing opportunities, and that means jobs and employment. For every 10,000 tonnes of waste recycled, 9.2 jobs are created, and you can compare that to the 2.8 jobs when the same amount of plastic goes into landfill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and related bills build on an important Labor legacy. Labor supercharged the process towards a more sustainable approach to material management by creating a national waste policy in 2009. We introduced the Product Stewardship Act in 2011, and that was a major step forward in developing a regulatory framework to encourage responsible waste management in partnership with industry. Labor created the one co-regulatory scheme in existence, the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme, and the well overdue statutory review of the relevant act confirms the fundamental value of this scheme. These bills establish a framework for the phased ban on the export of certain waste materials and they also absorb the regulatory framework previously contained in the Product Stewardship Act 2011, while making some minor changes to the substantive rules for product stewardship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should have acted significantly sooner, but it has dragged its heels on this question. These bills are best understood as a response to our inability to export our waste, as we previously were able to do. In January 2018, China instituted its National Sword policy, which banned the importation of most categories of waste. Until that point, a large proportion of Australia's waste products were sent to China. Similar announcements were subsequently made by India, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand, and there were reports of paper and glass building up in waste management centres across Australia. Some municipalities resorted to dumping recyclable waste in landfill to deal with the problem. These changes forced Australia's hand, and in March this year COAG agreed to ban the export of waste glass, plastics, tyres and paper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that exporting our waste was never a good solution. It is ultimately, and indeed by definition, unsustainable. It is not a real long-term solution. There were reports that material was not necessarily being recycled in the jurisdictions we were exporting this waste to. In some cases rubbish was burned, buried or thrown into rivers. Nonetheless, exporting that waste could have, in theory, bought us time to deal with our own waste problem, but that time was not used. The government could have been transitioning to a more sustainable use of resources during their time in office. Instead, next to nothing has been done. The amount of waste we exported actually grew under this government. Three million tonnes were being exported in 2006-07, compared to 4.5 million tonnes by 2018-19.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've already indicated, they didn't even do the required statutory review on time. That review of the Product Stewardship Act was supposed to be handed down in 2016 but was handed down three years later. There are consequences for the endless delay on almost everything by this government on matters of substance. On this question, a Senate inquiry into this bill heard from the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation. and they said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think it [the review of the NEPM] would have been a useful contribution to the discussion. The NEPM, like any regulation, has both positive and negative in it, and there are things that we recognise could be done better going forward. I think the fact that we're 20 years into that regulation and there hasn't been a review is probably more indicative of some of the issues or some of the perceptions that are currently out there, and I think that if a NEPM review had been done earlier then obviously it would have informed this discussion and given rise to thinking around other alternatives as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since taking office, the coalition has taken no action in listing any new item for co-regulatory or mandatory schemes. It is clearly not a priority for this government, whose indifference to the natural environment is scandalous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we welcome these bills. They are an important step but they do not go far enough. There are a number of specific amendments before the Senate to improve the operation of this act, but we also need practical steps to support recycling. The government announced a recycling fund after last year's election; however, it turns out that $100 million of this was, in fact, merely a reallocation of existing Clean Energy Finance Corporation funds, and questions to the government this year confirmed that not a single dollar had been loaned to support recycling infrastructure through the CEFC. The $20 million National Product Stewardship Investment Fund has not made a single grant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate inquiry into this bill noted the urgent need for the Commonwealth 'to adopt sustainable procurement models to provide leadership and boost the recyclables sector'. The inquiry recommended that the government should expedite consideration of a cost-benefit analysis of large infrastructure projects, including mandatory targets for the use of a percentage of recycled material. Most importantly, as the Labor senators noted in the inquiry's report on this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's lack of capacity to recycle the waste we produce, especially in certain material categories like plastic, is not unrelated to the lack of demand for recyclate, and there is no doubt this must be an area of focus and support, both through relevant procurement arrangements, and through product stewardship arrangements that are effective in seeing changes in product design and the lifting of recycled content outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The failure of the Morrison government to finalise market incentives for the use of recycled materials before implementing an export ban is creating a risk that domestic reprocessed materials which can be repurposed may still go to landfill after the bans are in place. As noted, such matters can only be addressed through the adequate provision of procurement targets that would drive the acquisition of waste materials. As the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association of Australia noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think the perverse outcomes we were talking about first and foremost were the fact that we've lost access to markets by bringing in the export bill without the commensurate demand onshore. The opportunity existed, if there was more emphasis on the product stewardship, with the paradigm shift towards generator responsibility, of utilising that product onshore. So, if I'm the packager that's making the plastic that was previously getting exported, now I have to use that packaging material in Australia, because it's good food grade. We could have avoided those perverse outcomes of additional stockpiling or landfilling. So the opportunity that's being missed today is the integration of these packages to change the shift of the paradigm to say, 'This is good material that could be used over and over in Australia and create jobs'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll conclude by making the obvious point that this is a disappointingly familiar story. The previous Labor government put in place a scheme to tackle a major problem. The scheme suffers neglect under the coalition. It turned out that there were consequences for literally taking no action at all, and the government was forced to take action. But, instead of getting a proper scheme that would stimulate jobs and build industry, we get a minor regulatory fix. Recycling, climate, energyâ€”that is a story that we see time and time again. This government is incapable of recognising environmental problems as being worth fixing. It is incapable of recognising the economic opportunities that come when you engage with environmental challenges properly. These bills are a necessary first step, but they're a step that should have been taken years ago and been accompanied by real action to build a real market for recycled materials in Australia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  I really am glad to be rising to speak on this bill that the government calls the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020. But the simple problem is that it does very little to reduce waste in Australia and it doesn't give the recycling industry the certainty they need to invest in a circular economy and move this country out of the waste crisis that we have been in since China soared in 2017. We have a historic opportunity with this bill to not only fix this waste crisis, create tens of thousands of new green jobs in a green industry, in recycling, and solve an environmental problem but also do a solid for our oceans and our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is very important to me personally. For nearly 15 years, I've been campaigning on trying to stop plastic going into the ocean. Nearly half of that time has been in this building, in parliament. In my first speech, I talked about this issue and some of the fantastic people in the community and in the environment movement I've been working with to tackle this problem. My first senator's statement was about tackling marine debris. I feel very privileged to have had the platform as a senator with a fantastic committee system and the cooperation across political parties to have initiated and chaired two Senate inquiries into marine plastic and into the plastic waste crisis we find ourselves in. This was the world's first parliament to do so. We were the first parliament to inquire into this most pervasive and enormous environmental problem and how we were going to get our way out of this waste crisis, because we've been so lazy by exporting our contaminated waste to the rest of the world for so long. We came up with a series of very good recommendations.</span>
                </p>

I know it's extremely important to my partyâ€”that is, my colleagues, who are going to make fantastic contributions to this debate; to Greens state MPs; to dozens of fantastic local government representatives for the Greens around the country; the supporters; and the environment movement. If I were to name the good people that I have campaigned shoulder to shoulder with on this for the last 15 years, my entire speech would be taken up by naming them, but I will try and get their names on record at some stage soon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here's the really interesting thing. I was really surprisedâ€”and I must say pleasantly surprised; you'd have to forgive me for being a little bit cynicalâ€”when the Prime Minister mentioned at a press conference that his daughter had raised this issue with him and that he was going to tackle this problem. I was even more surprised when he made it the keynote part of his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York in 2019. Of course, I'd like to have seen him talking about Australia taking a leadership role in climate change, but I wasn't going to complain that a prime minister of this country was telling the world that Australia was going to lead on this issue of tackling marine plasticsâ€”the toxic tide, the scourge of plastics in our ocean. And I understand it was something he discussed with US President-elect, soon to be President, Joe Biden; it was one of the issues they discussed on the telephone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that this bill, the way it is written, doesn't act on plastics in the ocean because it deliberately excludes plastic packaging, the key source of marine plastics. Yes, of course it is a global problem on a massive scale. As we speak now, thousands of tonnes of mostly single-use plastics are making their way into the ocean. It's been estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. We're finding microplastics in plankton in the Antarctic. It's all through our seafood chain. Yet what do we do about it? If you came to someone who understood this issue and said: 'How are we going to take action to reduce plastics in the ocean? What's the single most important thing you would do?' They would say: 'Ban the single-use plastics that are causing so much problem. Reduce our consumption and production of plastics that are almost impossible to recycle and that form so much of the litter and the trash that does so much damage to our precious marine life.' So the first thing you'd do is ban those plastics. But guess what? There's nothing in here to ban plastics. There's nothing in here to hold accountable the big producers of plasticâ€”some of the most profitable companies in Australia and internationallyâ€”and the retailers of plastic products, like the big supermarket chains. There's nothing in here to mandate strong targets for those companies. That's the second thing you would do; you would say, 'If plastic packaging is the problem, let's try and reduce as much as we can of the stuff that we just don't need.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By the way, everybody agrees, including the Australian Packaging Covenant, that we need to get rid of problematic single-use plastics. But where's the action on it? I'll tell you where it is: it's in the states and it's in the territories. They're going their own way because we've failed to show national leadership on this issue. The Senate Environment and Communications Committee recommended a ban on single-use plastics in 2017. It's not even included in the government's threat abatement plan for marine debris. Guess when marine plastic was declared a threatening process under federal environmental laws? In 2003! Nearly 20 years later we still haven't tackled the key source of plastic that's doing so much damage. But today, next week, this chamber and this parliament can do that. I expect we will do that, and that's what the Australian people expect of all of us. There's no more time for being cute and no more time for technicalities, excuses or wriggle room. Let's do it!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll talk in more detail about the Greens' amendments and other amendments when we get to the committee stage. They've been circulated now for over a month. We've had discussions with all political parties and all Independents about this issue. We can create Aussie jobs. Banning the export of waste, okay, was probably not the way I thought the government was going to go but, given the waste crisis we find ourselves in, if we ban the export of waste such as plastics, it does put it back on us to do something about it. It forces us to deal with this problem. If we go down the right pathâ€”and what we do in the Senate will dictate thatâ€”and build a circular economy then we will create Australian jobs, and not just in the big cities but also in rural and remote Australia. We will see massive upgrades in technology and infrastructure from the recycling industry. The recycling industry want to fix this problem, but they need policy certainty, and I'll go into that in more detail when we get to the Greens amendment on mandatory product stewardship schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't stress how important it is that we get this right. This is the first piece of legislation on waste that this parliament has seen in nearly a decadeâ€”I would say nearly two decades. I do acknowledge what Senator McAllister said earlier about Labor's contribution around product stewardship schemes. The architecture is already there. If anything, the second part of this bill, which is rewriting product stewardship schemes, really just fiddles around the edges. It has some added benefits and measures that we support, but it doesn't get to the root cause of the problem. But, as I said, I am convinced that we will do so today and next week, when we vote on this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I put up a private member's bill over 18 months ago to ban single-use plastics, to copy the European Parliament. I had been genuinely disappointed that the European Parliament beat us to the punch. They were the first parliament in the world to ban single-use plasticsâ€”although this chamber, this Senate, was the first to have a parliamentary inquiry into the problem. The Europeans beat us and banned single-use plastics, so I put up a bill that was going to do that. I also put up a private member's bill that was going to take the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation's voluntary targets for plastic and other packaging and mandate those, to put them into lawâ€”to take Labor's existing architecture and legislation and mandate it. I believe APCO when they tell me they are different from what they used to be. In 2005 APCO set themselves some targets for 2010 to achieve a 30 per cent recycling rate in this country. Ten years later, does anybody know what it is? It's 16 per cent. After 15 years we're recycling only 16 per cent of the plastic we consume in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation, which is predominantly made up of big packaging companies and retailers, have had these voluntary targets that they have never come close to meeting, and they've never been held to account. It's time for that to end. The recycling industry employs nearly 60,000 Australians, and it could be tens of thousands more if we had a full circular economy. If we back the recycling industry and give them the policy certainty they are asking forâ€”and they support the amendments that will be before the Senateâ€”we can actually create a circular economy with tens of thousands of jobs and solve an environmental problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four key stakeholders in this debate: the recycling industry; the packaging and retailing industry; local governments, who do a lot of the kerbside recycling; and community and environment groups. When my bill went to the Senate's environment committee we took extensive evidence, and three of those stakeholders supported the amendments that will be before the Senate. Local governments supported mandatory product stewardship schemes banning single-use plastics. Environment and community groups unanimously cheered on mandatory product stewardship schemesâ€”government putting packaging targets into law and banning single-use plastics. Three out of the four supported itâ€”no surprises as to who didn't support it: the packaging industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, in saying that, I'll be really clear: APCO said that they were agnostic as to what kind of structure they were put under. And the big retailers, like Woolworths and the Food and Grocery Councilâ€”which deals with a lot of the APCO members; I was on a really good hook-up with the CEO of Amcorâ€”all said that they were going to meet their 2025 voluntary targets. They're confident that they're going to meet them, so why would they have a problem with the Senate mandating them in law? You can talk the talk; walk the walk. It's easy enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we get to the committee stage we'll be able to talk in more detail about why banning single-use plastics is importantâ€”why taking voluntary schemes and mandating them, giving the recycling industry the confidence it needs, is so important if we want to fix this problem. In a truly circular economy, waste doesn't exist. Rubbish doesn't existâ€”the term doesn't existâ€”because everything has value. Everything is created for its end of life. It doesn't end up in the ocean and it doesn't end up in landfill. It ends up being reused and creating Australian jobs.</span>

                    <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I rise to speak on the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and the related bills. In doing so, as senators often do, we reflect on the constituents in our communitiesâ€”for me, people all across Queensland who would be listening in to this debate and paying special attention. I live in Cairns, the same place as does Molly Steer. She is a 12-year-old campaigner, who led the Straw No More campaign and managed to eradicate straws from cans when at a very young ageâ€”she was 10 or 11 years old when she started her campaign. I give this speech today in full recognition of the fact that there are people like Molly listening and wondering what the government has done after all its rhetoric about action on recycling, on waste and on plastics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this bill but remains critical of the government's inaction when it comes to regulatory reform of waste management and, quite frankly, to job creation in recyclingâ€”we know there's that potential if the government gets the settings right. Evidence from the Senate inquiry showed that, while stakeholders support an export waste ban, this bill lacks effectiveness. It highlights the Morrison government's poor track record of making lots of announcements and failing to deliver on those promises. This bill and the related bills would introduce a ban on the export of certain waste materials through a new licensing and declaration scheme, with standard qualifying requirements, fees and charges to cover those costs, and reporting arrangements. The bills would replace and update existing product stewardship laws, making overdue changes to the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation has been introduced, in part, because of China's decision in 2018 to ban the importation of most categories of wasteâ€”a decision which had a major consequence for the Australian waste management sector. It has meant that Australia now needs to dramatically increase our recycling capability and to better manage waste across the board. Labor has been critical of the government for its inaction when it comes to regulatory reform for waste management. Since the Liberal-National government came to power, it has taken no action in listing any new items for co-regulatory or mandatory schemes. The Morrison government has taken three years to conduct a review at a time when the country's waste crisis is worsening. Labor will support these bills, because there is no time to delay when it comes to banning the export of waste materials. But, in doing so, we want to highlight to the Senate some of the evidence that was received during the Senate inquiry and contained in the report handed down last month.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholders have said that they do support this legislation, but are concerned about the effectiveness of the legislation itself and some of the failures of this government to get the policy settings right. Stakeholders, including the National Waste and Recycling Industry Council, have acknowledged the government's lack of focus on reforming Australia's product stewardship regime. In their submission, the National Waste and Recycling Industry Council said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">there is nothing that compels the Minister to act should the recommended actions not be completed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Nor is it clear if the Minister can actually recommend in the priority list "apply for accreditation as a voluntary arrangement" as an action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Global Product Stewardship Council submission said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We encourage the Government to consider reflecting more of a clear willingness to pursue coregulatory approaches as appropriate to build upon the proposed strengthening around the Minister's priority list.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholders also recognised problems with the National Environment Protection (Used Packaging Materials) Measure 2011, which regulates industry participation for improving environmental outcomes for plastic packaging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation drove this point home in their evidence to the committee inquiry. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think the fact that we're 20 years into that regulation and there hasn't been a review is probably more indicative of some of the issues or some of the perceptions that are currently out there, and I think that if a NEPM review had been done earlier then obviously it would have informed this discussion and given rise to thinking around other alternatives as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor agrees that this evidence should be heeded, and notes that the Morrison government should have reviewed the National Environment Protection (Used Packaging Materials) Measure 2011 in conjunction with the Product Stewardship Act. As Senator McAllister pointed out, it was the former Labor government that established the product stewardship framework in 2011, which included the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme. This has led to the recycling of 360,000 tonnes of computer and TV e-waste. But since the Liberal-National government were elected they have failed to introduce any additional co-regulatory or mandatory schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Witnesses during the inquiry recognised the government's shortcomings in meeting key targets, including the goal of achieving 70 per cent recycling of packaging and elimination of unnecessary packaging. Currently only 12 per cent of plastic packaging in Australia is recycled, despite it being a major contributor to Australia's waste crisis. This raises the question of whether the targets can be achieved within the current voluntary participation framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a shame that it took a ban on importations by another country and several other key nations for the government to act on waste and recycling. There is now a serious deficiency in Australia's recycling capacity. There is now less capacity to recycle plastic than there was in 2005. All of those jobs that could have been created through this industry if the government had been willing to act have gone wanting. In Australia we recycle only 12 per cent of plasticsâ€”58 per cent of waste in total. The government's own review found that the growing number of industry free riders is the primary factor that leads to a failed voluntary scheme, yet their limiting response is to set up a form of naming and shaming to influence businesses to take responsibility but without any way of effecting that change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also brings into sharp focus some of the empty words and lack of follow-up by the Prime Minister and the Morrison government. They are always there for the photo op. When it comes to recycling, those photo ops are always quite flamboyant, always very interesting. The media releases go out. The Prime Minister has said he will champion recycling personally, but he still has not delivered on this. Just one week after the election the member for Leichhardt, Warren Entsch, hit the headlines in Cairns about his so-called war on plastic pollution. It was the major media story after the election. Mr Entsch, who had been returned as the member for Leichhardt, appeared on the front page of the local paper holding up a big bag of waste and saying he was going to declare a war on waste to protect the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In making those announcements, the Morrison government promised $100 million for the Australian Recycling Investment Fund, to be run by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. That's $100 million that this government promised. This scheme was intended to provide concessional loans of between $10,000 and $5 million to support the manufacturing of products from recycled plastics and paper, to take on the 'war on waste'. But, over 12 months later, not a single cent of this fund has been spentâ€”a promise of $100 million, but nothing has been spent. This is starting to become a very familiar pattern for this government. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation has confirmed that zero dollars have been loaned to date. The Morrison government has form when it comes to making carefully packaged announcements on waste and recycling, but, in large part, they're not worth the paper that they are written on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government also promised $20 million for the National Product Stewardship Investment Fund. This money was supposed to provide grants of between $300,000 and $1 million to encourage new and existing product stewardship schemes for batteries, electronic products and plastic oil containers. But in June this year the environment department revealed that the guidelines for this program had not even been finishedâ€”a $20 million announcement, and we don't even have guidelines yet, and the money isn't being spent. All these things that have been promisedâ€”here we go again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These two schemes form part of the Morrison government's $167 million recycling investment package. I'm sure that, in their speeches today, senators opposite will be talking about all these numbers, all these schemes and all these programs. Can I tell you, Madam Acting Deputy President Kitching, they don't mean anything if you don't actually deliver them. At least 72 per cent of the package that was announced by the Morrison government has made no difference to Australia's waste crisis 18 months on. Eighteen months onâ€”after the waste crisis was finally acknowledged by this government, and a war on waste was declared by members like Mr Entsch in Leichhardt and by the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison himselfâ€”at least 72 per cent of the package has not been delivered. Failures like this undermine the federal government's promise that the $600 million Recycling Modernisation Fund would create 10,000 jobs and divert 10 million tonnes of waste from landfillâ€”again, big numbers, big promises, but it's just not happening. These aren't isolated examples of incompetence. There is example after example of promises not being delivered by this government. Eight months ago, the Morrison government announced a $4 billion Emergency Response Fund to prepare for disaster recovery, and we know that that has not been rolled out. There are countless other examples of announcements made by this government, and recycling and waste is just another area where it has failed to deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this bill because there is no time to delay when it comes to banning waste materials and developing our recycling and waste industry. We want to see those jobs in places like regional Queensland. But we remain critical of the Morrison government's record on waste management. If the Morrison government continue to lag behind on targets to cut plastic pollution, this bill will not be as effective as it could be. Under the Liberal-National government, only 12 per cent of plastic packaging is being recycled. Progress on election promises like the $100 million Australian Recycling Investment Fund and the $20 million National Product Stewardship Investment Fund have stalled. The government have promised to spend this money, and they have failed. Time and time again, the Morrison government are failing to roll out what they are promising in a timely manner or in a manner that would make a difference. In many cases, they can't even get program guidelines finalised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I say to the young people living in Cairns, particularly Molly Steer, the activist of the Straw No More campaign, all the people who have stood next to members like Mr Entsch, all the people who have gone to the plastics summits and stood next to the Prime Minister as he's delivered yet another announcement and a commitment to take on this war on waste: unfortunately, the government are not delivering on their promises to you. They were very happy to stand up next to you, very happy to get a photo with you, very happy to tell you the big numbers they were going to spend and going to deliver, but they're not doing that. They stood next to young people and told them that they were going to take action on recycling and waste, they stood next to workers and said they were going to create jobs in this industry, but they haven't. The numbers don't lie. They are not spending this money and they are not rolling out these packages, and it can only be for one reasonâ€”that is, they really are not committed to taking action on recycling, taking action to help our environment or taking action to create jobs.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I'm very pleased to say that One Nation will support this bill. It's a rare event when I can honestly compliment the government for the quality of their drafting and the sincerity of the process. We have the courage and the integrity to give credit where it's due. This bill has been developed over many years of consultation, public submissions, exposure drafts and fine-tuning. The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 is an excellent outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provisions allow the minister discretion to pick the approach on an industry-by-industry basis, yet with enough written discretion for the minister so that there can be no backsliding. The time frames envisaged in the legislation are appropriate. The Greens amendments, sadly, are bringing forward time frames to the point where they will place an onerous burden on industry, and that means on jobs. Industry must have time to change their practices in a sensible and orderly fashion. Products with outdated packaging must be allowed to work their way through the supply chain so that small businesses and family supermarkets and low turnover areasâ€”often rural and regional Australiaâ€”are not left holding products that are illegal to sell. Where industry doesn't cooperate, there are penalties in this bill to ensure compliance. Those penalties are fit for purpose. The Greens amendments to increase the penalties would place a burden on small and medium business such that they are likely to threaten the future of those businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost every policy that comes from the Greens demonstrates a complete failure to understand rural and regional Australia and small businessâ€”in fact, a failure to understand Australia. Australia is more than the big cities. It's more than the inner big cities. The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill finds the right balance between urgency and fairness. And there is urgency required around this issue. Every year 645,000 tonnes of waste is exported to Third World countries from Australia. The locals there sift through the waste to remove anything of value, and, sadly, the leftover waste is often dumped into rivers, where it makes its way into our oceans. I often see social media posts pointing out that the garbage problem in the oceans comes from just seven major rivers and, therefore, is not our problem. The point that social media is missing here is that the waste from those rivers originated in countries like ours. It's our waste, and we need to own it and deal with it ourselves. This bill does exactly that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Processing such a large amount of extra waste will create additional employment here in Australia. Now, I appreciate that the Morrison government is getting quite the reputation for dodgy job creation statsâ€”trying to look good, not do good. The budget laid claim to creating more jobs than there are unemployed. For example, 400,000 JobMaker positions turned into 40,000, one-tenth. I was pleased, then, to fact check the figures for job creation contained in the explanatory memorandum to this bill and to find, to my surprise, they are accurate. This bill should create 10,000 new jobs, at a time when those jobs are badly needed. This bill is a win for the environment, a win for local industry and a win for the countries that we will no longer be using as our rubbish dumps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the waste reduction space, I often hear the phrase 'circular economy'. What it actually means is reusing plastics by cleaning them and then melting them down to re-enter the production process. As such, recycled resins compete with new resin. The suggestion on the CSIRO website is that the cheap cost of new resin makes the high cost of re-used resin commercially unviable. The Greens would add a carbon dioxide tax to new resin, meaning oil, to make the new option dear enough to make recycled resins attractive. Adding cost needlessly is typical Green thinking. Their solution is always to tax it or ban it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation has a better idea. Our CSIRO, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, has a role to play here. I acknowledge that it's been a long time since the industrial element of their charter has been used. The CSIRO, after all, has become in some ways a propagandist for global governance. Yet, I live in hope that the organisation charged by the Australian people with finding industrial solutions to everyday problems and challenges can come to our rescue here.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember when the CSIRO invented things and solved problems that Australia faced.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a massive opportunity for free enterprise to fix the problem of human progress. I urge the CSIRO to work with industry to produce biodegradable and compostable plastics that will allow Australians to simply switch from environmentally-damaging materials to environmentally-friendly materials. There is an opportunity, because pollution is waste. There is an opportunity for higher productivity. There is an opportunity for higher profits to those who are sensible. For example, safety was seen as a cost burden, yet incidents are a waste, so improving safety by removing incidents is an aid to reducing waste. It's an aid to improving productivity and profit. That's changing. Fortunately, people are starting to work out safety is not a cost and not a burden; it's potentially a boost to productivity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, quality used to be seen as a cost, as a burden. Defects are obviously waste. Now quality is starting to be seen by enlightened management as improving productivity and profit. The environment is similar. The environment is seen as a cost by manyâ€”seen as a burden. Yet pollution is waste. Pollution is the enemy of productivity. Pollution is waste, and when we remove the wasteâ€”remove the pollutionâ€”it improves the environment and it improves productivity and profit.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Real environmental problems, like real pollution of air, soil and water, are costly to humanity, to business and to profits. Fortunately, humans address real pollution. In California, for example, the pollution coming out of car exhausts is now one-thousandth of what it was in the seventies. That has led to more efficient use of fuel, which has saved money for peopleâ€”</span>

The government have been proud to serve and deliver for Australians a strong economy in the lead-up into this global economic crisis, this pandemic induced crisis, that we face. The government have worked tirelessly to create more employment opportunities for more Australians and have achieved that in record levels. We acknowledge, indeed, during that time that inflationary factors, including wage factors, have been at relative lows. They have been at relative lows together, noting that the inflation factors have also been at lows. So nominal wages growth has been at lows alongside low inflation growth. But what our government managed to achieve in the run-up to the last election was growth of 1Â½ million extra jobs in Australiaâ€”1Â½ million additional jobs for Australians, giving them every opportunityâ€”</span>

I've allowed you to remind the minister of the question, Senator Gallagher. When the minister is talking about wages growth I would contend that it includes being able to glance across, as he just was, issues of the labour market, as long as he relates those to wages growth. I cannot instruct him how to answer a question or the terms in which to answer it, but talking about wages growth is directly relevant to the question. Senator Wong?</span>

                  </a>  Indeed, I'm more than happy to talk about wages as well as jobs. The two are firmly connected. Real wages have increased in Australia over the past year. Wages price index growth of 1.4 per cent has outpaced inflation of 0.7 per cent. I was pointing out earlier in the answer, in addressing this, that inflation rates have been at incredible lows. With inflation low, unsurprisingly, so too are associated wages rates. But what we have done, and what has achieved the economic strength for Australia, was to achieve record jobs growth which, of course, feeds into wagesâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In this financial year alone, we will be spending around $34 billion on programs and services to support and improve the lives of Australians who live with disability. Today being the International Day of People with Disability, it's timely to reflect on the contribution of the more than 4.4 million Australians who live with disability. It's about celebrating their lives, their achievements and their contributions. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also an important opportunity to mark the contributions that people with disability make to the workforce and to focus our attention on making sure that we change the attitudes of our employers, so that they understand that people with disability can be a really strong asset in so many businesses around our country. I would encourage employers, not just today but all year round, to see the ability in disability and to hire based on what people can do and, in doing so, improve the job opportunities for people with disability and understand that people with disability are missing out on jobs because people just don't think this needs to change. </span>

It was designed by Oliver Mills, a 32-year-old man from Adelaide who lives with cerebral palsy, epilepsy and vision impairment. But that's only a small part of Oliver's story. He's also written four books and he's an artist, a poet and a speaker. We cannot overlook these talents and the experiences of people like Oliver and the contribution that they make to Australian society. So today, on the International Day of People with Disability, I encourage everybodyâ€”I encourage our communities, our workplaces, our schoolsâ€”to participate in the International Day of People with Disability. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In fact, we made it very clear that we would make sure that we had further proof points, if a debt was raised, to ensure that the income compliance program was determining debts by a valid means.</span>

Net zero by 2050 is no longer enough. Does the Prime Minister know this? Does he understand that we need net zero by 2035 or earlier?

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me, again, remind the Greens senators in relation to Australia's position that we have committed very clearly to the Paris Agreement, to reduction targets under the Paris Agreement and to deliver those targets and indeed strive to exceed those targets as we have done in relation to our commitments under Kyoto protocols 1 and 2. Our effort to date in terms of emissions reduction is real and world-class in terms of the level of those emissions reductions. If you take examples of reductions between 2005 and 2018, Australia has achieved a 13 per cent reduction in emissions. Compare that with othersâ€”Japan at eight per cent, the United States at 10 per cent, New Zealand at one per cent and Canada at 0.1 per cent. Our emissions reduction activities have been clearly delivered and our approach is to continue that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You asked about plans. Our approach is to continue to achieve those reductions through our investment in technology rather than the types of taxes or other mechanisms that the Greens, of course, would love to see applied. Our approach is to back technologies; to work with counterparts around the world like the United States in terms of investment in technologies along our tech roadmap; to build upon the partnerships we have struck in new technology areas like hydrogen with countries like Germany, Japan and Korea and to drive investment in those spaces; and to achieve positive outcomes that continue that track record of emissions reduction.</span>

Do you know why we have surplus credits? Because, when it comes to the first Kyoto commitment period, we overachieved. We made a commitment to the world that we would reduce our emissions and we did so not only by the margin we'd promised but by more than that, and that generated a surplus. Guess what's happened with the 2020 targetâ€”the second Kyoto commitment period? We made a commitment to the world again that we would reduce our emissions, and we met that commitment, and we overachieved. We overachieved for a second time. That is why Australia has carryover credits. Do you know what other countries do? Other countries don't achieve the emissions reductions in their own country and go and buy credits from elsewhere around the world. We've achieved the reforms in Australiaâ€”overachievedâ€”and that's why those credits exist.</span>

What I can confirm is that we're in the middle of a global pandemic and that many industries across Australia have been hard hit. I do acknowledge that the aviation sector, in particular, has been hard hit. As a result of that, you are correct: the government has provided industries and employers with support, whether that's by way of JobKeeper or the plethora of other policies that we have put in place. Like you, Senator Sheldon, and like my colleagues on the government side of the chamber, we are saddened by any job losses as a result of the global pandemic, including those job losses that have recently been announced by Qantas. Without a doubt, it has been a tough year for the aviation sector. It has been a tough year and a long year. And, in particular, as you know, Senator Sheldon, because of the fact that our international borders remain closed and our domestic borders are only now really reopening upâ€”and they will continue to reopenâ€”only now are we seeing more flights in the air. But, Senator Sheldon, our government has taken extensive action, as you know, to support the aviation sector to the extent possible, bearing in mind the extent of the global pandemic. And in fact, Senator Sheldon, you would be aware that support to Australia's aviation industry now totals more than $2.7 billion. But, like any industry in Australia and like employers, you are right: we have, as a government, provided them with support.</span>

Last week, Australia was able to welcome the return of Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert to Australia after more than two years in detention in Iran. These are deeply complex and very difficult matters to deal with in any international context and they're even further complicated by the impact of a global pandemic. Australia worked for two years to secure the release of Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert. A range of diplomatic discussions and exchanges between international partners are held at times such as this to pursue those matters. I will not go into further detail on those issues, but I am very pleased to be able to say to the chamber that it is an enormous relief to have been able to welcome Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert back to this country last week. We know that Dr Moore-Gilbert was imprisoned in Iranâ€”</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President. As I said, we never accepted the charges upon which Dr Moore-Gilbert was purported to have been detained and ultimately convicted and sentenced. In that context, we continued our negotiations. We will not go into the nature of diplomatic discussions with other countries. Our role is to protect the rights, freedoms and safety of our citizens in the national interest and that is our absolute focus. We consistently advocate in favour of the international rules based order and we fundamentally oppose coercive diplomacy in any of its forms.</span>

We have engaged with international counterparts in relation to those matters, particularly counterparts in the UN Human Rights Council and in the United Nations context. I'm working closely with my Canadian counterpart in particular on these issues. It is always a matter of concern when Australians travel to countries where issues such as this are referred to in our travel advice explicitly and openly. We recommend strongly that Australians who seek to travel to such places read and observe the travel advice. The current travel advice continues to be 'do not travel' in the context of COVID-19. We form the advice through our Consular and Crisis Management Divisionâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Australia continues to perform better than most other countries in terms of saving the lives of Australians and saving the jobs of Australians.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday's national accounts show that, in Australia, real GDP increased by 3.3 per cent, the largest quarterly increase since 1976. Of course, that came off the back of a significant decline in the previous quarter. However, when you look around the world, the decline Australia faced was less than most of the rest of the world and the recovery is stronger than most of the rest of the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the defining factors. It is ongoing work. It is going to be a long road back from here to recovery for all countries around the world. But over the past five months we've seen 650,000 jobs created, 344,00 of those filled by women and 226,000 filled by young Australians. We welcome this incredibly important progress in getting Australians back to work and the decline in the effective unemployment rate from 14.9 per cent to 7.4 per cent. Our economic recovery plan, outlined in the budget this yearâ€”with programs to enable businesses that were previously profitable to have loss carry backs, our investment deductions, the bringing forward of tax cuts and plans around HomeBuilderâ€”are all about the next stages of recovery over the months and years ahead, to keep getting more Australians back into the workforce and to drive those numbers to where they were in the past. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Why must people wait longer than the 7Â½ years that they have already been detained? Has your government not heard of, and does it not have the capacity for, walking and chewing gum at the same time?</span>

And this is what Senator McKim also failed to tell the Senate: that overall we've reduced the number of people in detention by 85 per cent, from more than 10,000 under his alliance to just 1,500 now; and that more than 70 per cent of those in detention centres have a criminal record.</span>

The challenges for many Australians overseas are well appreciated by the government. This is a very difficult time, and the impact of the pandemic has not, as it would be easy to say or think, passed. It is in fact a matter which many countries around the world continue to grapple with at the most difficult level now. The health and the safety of Australians abroad and at home has been the government's No. 1 priority in these difficult and unprecedented times. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are very aware that many Australians face hardship overseas because of the global travel restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are helping vulnerable Australians by facilitating access to flights to Australia; by providing financial assistance where required, through the hardship program which we announced some months ago; and by continuing to provide professional and responsive consular assistance to those in need. Since the national cabinet meeting on 18 September, where the Prime Minister indicated that, of the 26,000 Australians then overseas, we would endeavour to bring as many of those Australians back to Australia as we could, we have seen 40,800 Australians return from overseas, including more than 16,000 Australians registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Of those, over 3,500 were categorised as 'vulnerable'. Since the government advised Australians to return, more than 432,000 Australians have returned to Australia.</span>

I'm pleased, obviously, to update the Senate that the Morrison government welcomes the emergency approval given to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom. This is particularly so, given the over 1.6 million cases and the tragic loss of over 59,000 lives in the United Kingdom. This emergency approval is not a full public authorisation; however, it does allow the United Kingdom government to deploy the vaccine as quickly as possible to specific groups of patients, such as frontline healthcare workers, people over the age of 80 and aged-care residents. This emergency authorisation is in response to the very high disease load in the United Kingdom at present. It is understood that, under the emergency use authorisation, the vaccine will not be generally available to the wider United Kingdom population.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of Australia, Pfizer continues to work with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, providing data for safety and efficacy as part of the approval process. Our advice remains that the time line for a decision on approval is expected by the end of January 2021, and our planning is for the first vaccine delivery in March 2021. Pfizer's, of course, is one of four vaccines the Australian government has purchased, for a total projected supply of around 134.8 million units. In addition, we will have access to up to 25.5 million units under the international Covax Facility. Safety is of course our No. 1 priority, and Australia is well placed for a thorough but rapid safety assessment and an early rollout of a free, voluntary but universally available COVID-19 vaccine program.</span>

This means Australia has secured enough supplies to vaccinate Australians many times over, subject to success and approvals. Our medical experts have identified the class of vaccines that we need. The vaccines we have secured are amongst the most advanced, and it is increasingly likely that all of our contracted vaccines are on the pathway to being successful, safe and effective.</span>

When we look, though, at the situation here in Australia compared to that of other nations, we are performing remarkably well. Just in terms of a global update, there have been over 63 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally and over 1.4 million deaths in total. In Australia, we've had 27,923 confirmed cases and, sadly, 908 deaths. Whilst we can never be complacent, the systems we have in place have resulted in lower loss of life, lower transmission rates and lower economic impacts than in most other countries.</span>

So, as we have done through the budget process through the period of COVID-19, we have put in significant measures to support young Australians. In fact, it's interesting that the Labor Party were only a few weeks ago criticising the government for the range of measures that we have put in place to support young Australians to get back into work as the economy recovers from COVID-19.

The work that this government continues to do to support young Australians to get back into work is because we are concerned that young people who stay out of work too long have significant lifelong effects with respect to their futures, their careers and their financial circumstances, so we have, through our budget processes and through the pandemic, been supporting people with JobKeeper, supporting young people with JobSeeker, to keep them connected to their workplaces, and then supporting them to gain new jobs through our JobMaker programsâ€”</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday's national account figures are nothing to crow about. Our GDP is nowhere close to where it was a year ago. Investment is down, consumption is still down, wages are still stagnant, the labour share of income has fallen to record lows and there are still 2.4 million Australians either unemployed or underemployed. The Morrison government are out there congratulating themselves while millions of Australians are still hurting and the jobless queues are growing. Nothing has been done about the challenges of insecure work and underemployment. It is clear for many Australians that what looks like a recovery on paper will still look like a recession for them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just ask the 2,000 newly outsourced workers at Qantas; 2,000 Australian men and women, with families right across Australia, now without work because of the heartless decisions of the Qantas board under the government's watch and the government's subsidies. Only a few hours ago, I stood with Qantas workers like Sean. Sean works for Qantas as ground crew at Canberra Airport, and he has a wife and three young daughters. He said, 'How am I to tell my three girls that you can work hard but you can be replaced by a company that will pay people less?' This is happening on the government's watch and with Australian taxpayers' moneyâ€”no accountability, no control and no responsibility of these companies and the actions that they are taking. You, the government, are abandoning hardworking Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Is this the economy that we want in Australia? These are jobs that will go to the lowest common denominator, to companies that pay the lowest wages. Jobs will go to companies with lower conditions. The workers at Qantas will have to beg for their old jobs at lower rates and lower conditions. Why? Because of the CEO Alan Joyce's corporate bastardry. He doesn't care about the workers that made the company the 'spirit of Australia'. This is quite obviously not the Australian way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If losing your job at an outsourced company isn't enough of a kick in the teeth, Alan Joyce and the board of Qantas have done this plan with the implicit backing of the government. Qantas has received more than $800 million in government support, tax relief and JobKeeper paymentsâ€”all of it taxpayer money, much of it from the taxes of many thousands of Qantas workersâ€”to keep the airline alive, to keep it flying and to keep these jobs secure. Instead, when Alan Joyce and the board chose to abandon these workers they did so taking Morrison's money and running for it. They did it with the Prime Minister not saying a word. The Prime Minister and the government have abandoned these workers to lower pay and lower conditions, all the while patting themselves on the back that we are technically out of a recession. The government is crowing about comeback. These Qantas workers want a comeback too. They want to come back to their jobs at the same rates and conditions they worked hard to earn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The road to a better economy and to recovery is getting longer and longer every day that the Morrison government ignores the catastrophe in the aviation industry. First they let Virgin fail, leaving thousands of workers without jobs and the corporate raiders to pick through the scraps. Then they abandoned the workers at dnata, retrospectively denying them JobKeeper with the cruel stroke of a penâ€”a mistake that the Treasurer could fix this afternoon with just another stroke of that pen. And now the workers at Qantas, more than 2000 everyday, hardworking Australians, have been abandoned by this government. Only a few weeks ago, this chamber passed a motion calling on Alan Joyce and Qantas to stop this madness. Did they listen or did they care? No. Is this the future economy in Australia, one where businesses take from the public purse with one hand and, with the other, sign away thousands of jobs without a thought of the cost to their workforce and fellow Australians? And the government turns a blind eye to blatant acts of corporate bastardry.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  Perhaps I can start with a tone that is a little bit different to what we often employ in this chamber in taking note of answers, which is often a time for theatrics, drama and witty slurs across the chamber. Speaking of slurs, Senator Sheldon's given us a fine example of precisely the kind of behaviour that isn't appropriate when we're talking about the families who are suffering the consequences of a commercial decision that Qantas has taken in relation to making staff redundant. I notice that Senator Sheldon is walking out of the room during a debate that he pretendsâ€”</span>

                  </a>  Perhaps I will frame it this way instead: while I was willing to give Senator Sheldon the respect of listening to his contribution, I hope he will listen as sincerely, and in the heartfelt fashion that this important issue deserves. I've got my doubtsâ€”nevertheless. Any job lost is a disaster. It's a disaster for the people involved and it's a disaster for us here in the coalition. It's part of the reason that the Morrison government has put so much effort and so much of the public's resources into trying to keep businesses strong so that they can keep their staff on. Whether we talk about the cashflow boost, about JobKeeper, about the instant asset write-off or about programs like HomeBuilder or JobMaker, we are trying to make it as easy as possible to keep working people in work. We know that when businesses are strong they can keep their staff on, and that gives the certainty families need to get through this time of uncertainty. I understand that anxiety; we all do. That's why our every effort is going into building that economic strength and resilience.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the difficulty I have with the argument made by Senator Sheldon just a moment ago is that it takes a small piece of the puzzle and ignores all the other interconnected parts that go into whether or not a business is able to keep staff on. He's happy to talk about how we must at all times have rising wages, and he's happy to talk about how we must at all times have all people in secure work. These are all wonderful goals. But if we don't look at the context in which that occurs, it's actually pretty ignorant. Those opposite have fought tooth and nail for zero flexibility in the workplace. They have fought tooth and nail to deny businesses the chance they need to move people around or change the way they do things, or shift people into different skill sets to try to get through hard times and emerge stronger, more able to offer the kinds of high wages and security that is desirable. They've stood in the way of those important measures, every day that they have served in this parliament, going back decades. The issue of industrial relations is one that gets nothing but obstinacy from those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They need to confront a really uncomfortable truth, and that is that by their very obstinacy, their very refusal to countenance any kind of flexibility at any time, they end up with the very policies that tend to sign the redundancy papers of good people who deserve jobs. The fact is that businesses need to be able to adapt to difficult times, and this is one of those times. The failure to adapt, the failure to give a business that's struggling to cope with the situation the ability to shift gears in order to survive hard times, is what ends the opportunity for vulnerable peopleâ€”like those who are in the galleryâ€”to keep their jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of standing here and grandstanding, Senator Sheldon and his colleagues should apologise to the Qantas workers who've been let down by inflexible and unreasonable industrial relations attitudes from those opposite. I call upon those opposite to get in to a mental space where they confront the reality of the difficult market for aviation and the difficult market we all face during COVID and start to take a team Australia approach, because the prospects of business survival are actually compatible with the positive prospects of working people.</span>

How many negotiations have I entered into not only as a delegate, as a long-distance owner-driver, but also as a union organiser during 28 years on the job? How many grown men have you had in your office, Senator Stoker, on a Friday night, bursting into tears when they have found their job go down the road? How dare you use that language?

Now, before we start talking about the disgraceful rates of pay that Qantas workers demand: they were negotiated over the years. They were negotiated by the workers on one side, represented by their unions, and by management on the other side.

They're giving you thisâ€”this is what they're saying to you: 'Thank you very much, because we're not only going to get rid of the workers; we want their jobs to come back with companies that will not even pay Australian standards.' They won't pay the superannuation guarantee charges that we are seeking. They will fight like hell. And you make it sound like Qantas are going broke. Guess what, Senator Stoker?

As the borders come down and we kick in, you should watch the flights come up on the screens next week. Watch all the flights come in for Christmas. Dare may I suggest: check how much it cost us to get here to Canberra, because we all probably came on Qantas, unless some drove. Check the prices that Qantas are charging us to go home.

Remember that magnificent piece of bastardry not only for Australian travellers but for worldwide Aussies trying to get home? They say, 'Oh we forgot about that.' He has eight other accomplices. He is ably backed up. I'm calling for this mob to resign. Joyce must lead the charge and resign, because there's no guts on that side. The Prime Minister is lacking guts. He's too busy flicking money. He's hand in hand with Mr McCormack and their mates at Rex. I'll tell you what, what about Richard Goyder, the chairman? Why should he escape scrutiny while he is on his $584,000 of Qantas's money. It's Qantas's money; it's not earned by the greedy board. It's earned by the 30,000 workers. Madam Deputy President Lines, you used to represent Qantas workers. Your great union stood up for Qantas workers for many, many years. You know the negotiations we've had. It's $584,000, and yet Mr Goyder did not make Qantas greatâ€”the workers made Qantas greatâ€”but he couldn't wait to get his claws into the till, ably backed up by, as I said, Mr Joyce.</span>

There's Todd Sampson. That's the last time I'll ever watch him on TV; what a state of hypocrisy that fellow showed. And there's Antony Tyler, Barbara Ward AM, and Paul Rayner.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  I would like to continue the remarks there of Senator Sterle. He was right in the conclusion of his take note speech, in that he started to point the finger in the right direction: the Qantas board. He mentioned a name that probably didn't get enough prominence, but I will bring that to attention, because I think it must be mentioned: Ms Barbara Ward AM. She just happened to be a senior ministerial adviser toâ€”wait for itâ€”former Prime Minister Paul Keating. I wonder if this is her 30 pieces of silver for privatising Qantas. That's the thing here, and I've been consistent about this. I talked in my maiden speech about how privatisation wasn't the right thing to do, so you can't call me hypocritical about this. The privatisation of Qantas was facilitated by superannuation and the industry funds who wanted to privatise everything so that Labor and the unions could get control of industry. Well, guess what? You've got your people on the boards now, and one of them just happens to have been a senior ministerial adviser to Paul Keating. I don't want to start getting into it, but, at the end of the day, Alan Joyce is there at the behest of the shareholders and of the board. I did have a look at the top 20 shareholders, and, unfortunately, they're all nominee holdings, which I'm working on, because it annoys me that I can't see who owns what. But, if you're keen on this, Senator Sterle, I'd be keen to find out who the biggest shareholders are in their real names, not in nominee accounts. But if you were to drill down into who the shareholders of Qantas are, I suspect that a large proportion of them would be industry super funds. I'm not having a go here but, seriously, if you want to do something about this in a constructive manner, I suggest that you find out which industry funds own Qantas sharesâ€”</span>

                  </a>  I'm talking about jobs; I'm getting on to jobs. If you want to do thisâ€”and you guys now have control of industry through your industry super fundsâ€”you need to speak directly to the industry funds because we, as the government, no longer own Qantas. I spoke about this in my maiden speech: there is no accountability. Who is accountable if infrastructure is sold? It was the Labor Party that sold Qantas. To be fair, I've got a lot of time for you, Senator Sterle and Senator Gallagher, but it's a bit rich to come in here and have a go at us because we've been trying to help people get through the COVID crisis. We drew a line in the sand because we didn't want to subsidise foreign owned companies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been actively trying to get Qantas to relocate to Queensland to lower costs, because it's cheaper to live in Queensland. The airline was started in Queensland; it's not the New South Wales and Northern Territory air service, it's the Queensland and Northern Territory Air Service. The first time I met Alan Joyce I said, 'When are you taking Qantas back home?' because that's where it belongs. Let me tell you, if it were back in Queensland it would be a lot cheaper to run. We should also bring home QBE. I totally empathise with the fact that this work has been outsourced. I hate outsourcing and, if you read chapter 12 of Machiavelli's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Prince</span>, you'll see it says never outsource. It says never use mercenaries and never use auxiliaries, and I've always subscribed to that. In my own work experience, whenever we outsourced we always ended up in a terrible situation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, what I will rebut in this discussion is the idea that the government doesn't care about the welfare of working-class Australians. That is why today we stood up and were happy to push back on what Labor seemed to thinkâ€”that we shouldn't count those carbon credits, which were earned, fair and square, by Australian workers, particularly those in the agricultural sector and particularly those in south-west Queensland. I mentioned yesterday that they are doing it tough because we're locking up mulga paddocks. I tell you what: your old mate Barry O'Sullivan would be choking on his soup if he knew about what we're doing in great towns like Charleville, Quilpie and Longreachâ€”and I should add that Longreach is the home of Qantas. So before we engage in argy-bargy for the sake of argy-bargy, I would ask you to reflect on this: someone owns Qantas. Go to the shareholdersâ€”the people who control the company and control the board. I agree with you on Todd Sampson: I've got no idea what he's doing on the board; I don't know how this bloke got on there. And let's try to find a solution together.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  Today I got the chance to meet with Qantas workers here in Parliament House, and I asked them what they usually do for Christmas. They are going to have a very different Christmas this year. Usually, on Christmas Day, they go to work. They go to work so that other people can get home to see their families and spend Christmas with their families. But this Christmas they are looking down the barrel of losing the jobs that they have had for decades. They found out that they would be losing their jobs through an SMS. A TV screen came up with an automated message that told them that a decision had been madeâ€”not to cut their jobs because the work didn't need to be done anymore, but to outsource their jobs to another company, to other workers. I asked them: was there someone there to take your questions, to listen to you, to talk about these concerns, to tell you why this decision had been made? There wasn't. Nobody at that company was willing to stand up and listen to the concerns of workers. They had left the room.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we're here today talking about this decision. We're talking about it in reference to the decisions that the federal government has made with regard to the aviation sector. Nobody here is denying that the aviation sector has had a difficult time through this pandemic. Nobody is denying that. Labor senators have been calling since the start of this pandemic for support for our aviation sector from this government. What we are saying is: if you are going to deliver $800 million in taxpayer funding to Qantas then why would you give that money with no strings attached? Why would you hand over that amount of supportâ€”support that was greatly needed to make sure people could continue to travel and that jobs could be savedâ€”and tell workers it would save their jobs when it hasn't? This company has taken all that support from the federal government with no strings attached.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know is that these jobs are being outsourced, not cut. The company made a decision to make these jobs less secure, to make sure these people can't unionise, don't have annual leave and probably won't even know what their shifts are. They've given 10 years of loyal service to the companyâ€”and, let's face it, to Australians, because they have been the ones getting you home when you needed to go home for Christmas, the ones making sure you could spend time with your family. They have been the ones getting you there safely, because these workers care about safety, but this outsourcing decision will make sure that the people who stand up for safe conditions in aviation won't have the same job security they had at Qantas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, yes, we are asking the government: Is that acceptable? Do you support that decision? They can't possibly say that they do, because if they do they will have to admit they gave this company $800 million in support without thinking to attach the condition that the company didn't outsource jobs. I want to make sure that those oppositeâ€”because they crow a lot about supporting regional jobsâ€”know that this decision will result in 50 jobs being cut at Cairns Airport in regional Queensland. These are 50 jobs going from a community that has already suffered enough, where jobs have already become less secure. This comes after previous redundancies resulted in about 90 jobs lost at Cairns Airport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, no-one is denying that it has been a difficult time, but when these workers have come here or when they've rallied outside MPs' offices all they've had are denials that this government is prepared to do the tough, hard thing to stand up for their jobs. That's all they're asking you to do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we heard from the Secretary-General of the UN, Antonio Guterres, a very clear and sobering warning about the situation that the world faces right now. Secretary-General Guterres told the world that we need to lift our ambition urgently, quickly and seriously if we are to tackle the collapse of biodiversity and the climate before it really is too late. He said: 'This is an epic policy test. But ultimately this is a moral test.' He said that if we continue with the denial, continue to think that action does not need to be taken urgently and we can push things off to the latter half of this century, we are risking suicide. He said that it would be 'suicidal' to continue to deny the action science tells us we need to take. Secretary Guterres has called for countries to take more action and be more ambitious in relation to our 2030 emissions reduction targets. He has called on us to do whatever we can to make sure we meet net zero emissions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than going with a 2050 target, it's quite clear that, if we are to tackle the climate crisis, the extinction crisis and the death of this planet, we have to bring forward that target, to much, much earlier. The goal posts have shifted. As to debating about whether 2050 is the appropriate time frame for net zero emissionsâ€”we've missed the boat. We have to make that decision much, much earlier. It needs to be at least 2035, if not earlier. Yet we've got our government refusing to engage in a proper strategy and the action to reduce our pollution to help address the climate crisis in the time frame that we have left. We have 10 years to take action.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN's dire warnings today should not simply be dismissed. In fact, what we're seeing now is that countries right around the world are focusing their minds, sharpening their actions and forcing countries like Australia to justify our ignorance. There is nowhere left to hide. We've just had, of course, the very clear message sent from President-elect Biden that we need to come to the UN conference next year in Glasgow with a much more ambitious attemptâ€”with commitment and action to tackle climate change and reduce carbon pollution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have the head of the UN saying that, if we don't do this, we risk the death of the planet. He says: 'The state of the planet is broken.' He talks about the impact on food security and on conflict, saying that now climate change is not just risking the health of our environment, with more extreme weather and the expansion of deserts and the choking of our oceans, but that climate change is going to be the biggest driver of conflict around the world, with the displacement of people and the conflict that flows from that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister whether this government understands how dire this situation is. I asked the Prime Minister, through Senator Birmingham, whether he understood that we needed to get to net zero emissions by at least 2035. I asked the Prime Minister, through Senator Birmingham, whether we were going to improve our action towards 2030 and have a more ambitious target, and I asked the Prime Minister, through Senator Birmingham, whether the government would rule out using Kyoto carryover credits. On all three of those questions, the minister refused to answer. And why? Is it just ignorance? Is it because they're too busy faffing about and they do not understand their own policy, or are they just hoping that, if they continue to turn a blind eye to the facts, the crisis will somehow disappear? We need climate reality from this government, and all we've got is climateâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless welfare cardâ€”and I don't think there is another issue that so clearly demonstrates this government's agenda to demonise, penalise and brutalise people who find themselves relying on our social safety nets. It is a terrible policy, a devastating policy and one that has through numerous inquiries seen no evidence to suggest that this is the direction our country should continue to go. For the people of the Northern Territory, whom I represent here in the Senate, there has been overwhelming evidence that they certainly do not wish to be a part of the cashless debit card trials or permanent situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of the Northern Territory had the 2007 intervention put upon them, which brought the BasicsCard and forced compulsory income management on every single family who lived in over 70 communities that were identified by the Commonwealth as areas that they should intervene in. Those families, their children and, for some, their grandchildren have grown up under this system over the last 13 years of income management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard some comments around whether there is extra food on the table, but can I just remind the Senate that we have had a COVID-19 pandemic which has seen the increase of funds to families across Australia. And guess what? That too puts food on the table. The real issue here though goes far deeper. The real issue here is the focus on a particular race here in the Northern Territory. I cannot stand more passionately against such racist intervention, such a deliberate attempt to continue to disempower some of the most vulnerable families without encouraging them to empower themselves to rise above their particular situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not good enough to say that the family over there who lives in a remote or regional part of Australia should have their money and their choices determined by this parliament in such a way where they feel they have no chance to rise above their own situations and to grow, just as any other Australians do in determining their own futures, their livelihoods and the livelihoods of their children. The Australian government is considering the best possible ways to support people, families and communities in places where high levels of welfare dependence coexist with high levels of social harm. The cashless debit card is testing whether reducing the amount of cash available in a community will reduce the overall harm caused by welfare-fuelled alcohol, gambling and drug misuse. It is pretty clear the CDC has failed that test; by any measure it is exacerbating harm and hardship. The efficacy of the cashless debit card and income management more generally has been the subject of several inquiries, as I have mentioned, and these investigations have not found evidence of the effectiveness of these policies. In fact, significant harm has been associated with compulsory, broad based income management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An independent analysis of the cashless card in Ceduna conducted by the University of South Australia concluded:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have shown the CDC policy to have had no substantive effect on the available measures for the targeted behaviours of gambling or intoxicant abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Isn't it incumbent on us as political leaders to listen to this and, in particular, on this government to listen to its own reviews of its own policies? Yet on this particular occasion a mere $2.5 million review of the evaluation of four trial sites across three jurisdictions, with two trial sites in one, was not even read by this minister. Not even the department that she is responsible for could tell us of the certainty of that report. However, all of that aside, the minister still introduced this piece of legislation in order to continue to permanency those four trial sites across Australia and, even worse than that, include 23,000 Territorians and families in Cape York without even having read her own evaluation report. It is absolutely disgraceful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we saw in the House of Representatives last night the member for Bass, Bridget Archer, stand up and argue that numerous inquiries have failed to find any evidence that the cashless debit card scheme is of any benefit to at-risk communities. She is a Liberal member of the Morrison government who says it fails to address systemic issues of disadvantage among vulnerable Australians. Mrs Archer was telling her team this is a policy that is not working and she does not want to see it in Tasmania. Unfortunately, Mrs Archer did not go far enough and vote against the cashless debit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But then we see today another Liberal MP has come out and said, 'This just does not work.' Victorian Liberal MP Russell Broadbent said his expectation is that the government would drop the legislation, which also transitions another 46,000 people in the Northern Territory, in Cape York, onto the card. According to Mr Broadbent:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No one wants to rock the boat over this issue but I don't believe it has broad support in the party room.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Broadbent told <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">People should have the freedom to deal in cash if they want to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, there you go. I wonder if we have courageous senators of the coalition government who will not only speak their truth, similar to their colleagues in the lower house, but stand up and vote against this horrendous policy that disempowers, brutalises and keeps people in poverty and gives them no hope of breaking through their incredible disadvantage, which they do not need thrown in their faces, because they experience it so deeply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had the wonderful pleasure of being able to invite senators to the Northern Territory and to ask them to listen to the people of the Northern Territory. I thank Senator Rex Patrick and Senator Jacqui Lambie for doing exactly that. This particular piece of legislation is going to have a profound impact on the lives of thousands and thousands of families of the Northern Territory who have had enough. I want senators in here to speak from the heart, to bring back the voices that they listen to up north. I also thank Centre Alliance. Rebekha Sharkie and her staff came up to the Northern Territory. I know that that was shared with Senator Griff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators, I dearly hope that you will do some solid reflection on this piece of legislation. This is the time when our parliament can be enormously courageous and get rid of the cashless debit card and get rid of the falsehood of what it espouses to do for the people of Australia, when in reality what it does is disempower, disengage and give hopelessness to Australian families who need far more from us as politicians and who need far more from us as a country that should be working with all families to rise above all of those issues and empower them to be the people that they are here to be, just as we are standing here in this parliament. </span>

My views on the cashless debit card and income management are well known in this place. From day one the Greens have said, 'This is not good policy; this is not the way to treat people.' Compulsory income management has been in this country, in the Northern Territory, for nearly 13Â½ years. </span>

                    </a>  Yes, I heard that intervention. For those that didn't hear it, they mentioned Jenny Macklin. And, yes, Labor did make a mistake. I have said that many times in this place. But they have now looked at the evidence and seen it doesn't work. So I give them an enormous amount of credit for that. Certain Labor senators have been opposed to this all along. They knew it wasn't going to work. They've looked at the evidenceâ€”or should I say lack of evidence? That is, in itself, evidence, I suppose you'd say. It doesn't work. The final evaluation of the Northern Territory Intervention clearly showed that. It met none of its objectives. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government keeps changing what the objectives of the trials are. The Intervention was originally supposedly about ending child abuse and putting food on the table, and then the trials morphed into addressing alcohol and drug abuse and gambling. And now they seem to be morphing back into being about putting food on the table. This is flawed ideology about the way that you achieve change. Do you know the way you achieve change? You address the underlying causes of the disadvantage that exists in First Nations communities. You address the social determinants of health. You address the fact that this is still stolen land. We have never, ever acknowledged that as a nation. You address the intergenerational trauma. You address the fact that children are still being inappropriately taken from their families. You address the fact that there's not sufficient housing. You acknowledge the intergenerational trauma and finally address that. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, what do the government do? They take an ideological approach. That's the only conclusion you can draw. Despite the fact that there's no evidence, they still proceed and they send in the warriors to argue that this is the way to go. A certain billionaire puts up the idea that income management is the way to go, despite the fact that the final evaluation of the Northern Territory Intervention showed that it did not meet any of its objectives. This is the time where we knock this failed, flawed, ideological, punitive approach, this racist, discriminatory approach, on the head. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this comes up for a vote next week, this chamber has the opportunity to say no permanently and end this abusive card which for 13 years has been in place in this country. Knock it off. I beg crossbench senators to knock this off finally. Say no. Don't let them do this permanently, and don't negotiate any form of extension, which is what has happened in the past; they've said: 'Oh, let's just extend this a little bit longer'. No. We don't need any more extensions. It's flawed. It's failed. The government haven't produced their evaluation. They've had it for quite some time nowâ€”it makes you wonder what's going on with it. Perhaps it doesn't say the things they want it to say, just like the ORIMA evaluation didn't say the things they wanted it to say, and just like the Auditor-General's report. The ANAO's report found that there was actually no evidence to show that they could claim there was a reduction in social harm. Knock this legislation off, and let's focus the resources, the time and energy, that are wasted on this flawed approach on something that works. Let's genuinely commit to walk with First Nations peoplesâ€”in fact, to walk behind them. We need to have First Nations-led decision making here. The government runs the line: 'We did talk to First Nations peoples.' Well, they didn't talk to communities. Let's walk the talk of the new Closing the Gap agreement with First Nations peoples. The cashless debit card is not walking the talk. Knock it off for goodâ€”permanentlyâ€”when this comes to a vote next week.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  I also rise to take note of the additional information in relation to the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Continuation of Cashless Welfare) Bill 2020. I share the anger and the angst of others on this side of the chamber in relation to the government's pursuit of this legislation. Among this additional information that's been presented to the chamber this afternoon, I note in particular that Senator Siewert asked for information about the departmental costs to date associated with the CDC for the department and any other government department associated with the trials. And it was a rather eye-watering amount: the cost from 2015-16 to 2019-20 was some $33.632 millionâ€”for the hotline, the card, merchant management, administration, processing and support, blah, blah, blah. I have to say, when this government is looking at putting people into mandatory cashless debit card income management and they also want to reduce the payments for the same people who are on payments like JobSeeker to just $40 a dayâ€”what is it they really think they're doing in spending that astronomical amount of money on micromanaging people's finances? What's the point of micromanaging the finances of people who simply don't have enough to live on anyway?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that one of the objectives of the so-called cashless debit card is to address alcohol and drug abuse. I have to say that if you are managing to buy alcohol on those low paymentsâ€”looking at Labor's dissenting report, we know the research into the cashless debit card showed that some 87 per cent of people on the card simply didn't have a problem with alcohol. Eighty-seven per cent of participants reported they did not have a problem with alcohol. Now, if you take the 76 senators in this place and 76 people who might be on JobSeeker payments in the Northern Territory and who have been placed on this cashless debit cardâ€”76 senators verses 76 people on the cashless debit card who get JobSeeker payments in the Northern Territoryâ€”who do you think spends more on alcohol each month, each fortnight? Hands down, I'm sure the money spent in here would be tenfold the money spent by anyone on a cashless debit card, so if you want to invite people to look in your pocket, to look at your drug habits, at your alcohol consumption, then go right ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This punitive micromanagement that does nothing to build the capacity and resilience of people is absolutely galling, and I find the focus on making the cashless debit card compulsory in the Northern Territory implicitly and overtly racist. It is overtly racist, just like other examples in Australian history. We had a debate this week about saving a seat in the Northern Territory. In 1911 the Northern Territory was split from South Australia to become a territory, and effectively had its Senate voting rights at that time removed. It had its democratic House of Representatives voting rights removed. South Australia got its 12 senators, and the people of the Northern Territory lost their right to vote for senators. Would we have done that to the population of the Northern Territory back then, in 1911, had the population of the Northern Territory been all white? The answer is obvious. It's intrinsically obvious. The answer is, of course, no. I think in the future when people look back on this debate about the cashless debit card, when they reflect on this debate, they will know that the Northern Territory is being singled out because the majority of people who live there are First Nations people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So when it comes to these debates, we must, as others have said, leave the cultural authority and leadership around finding things that work for community in the hands of those communities. We are too far and too remote. It's not them; it's not those in the communities of the Northern Territory that are remote. It's we that are remote from them. We have to talk about the issues in their communities in a way in which they have the voice in it, not us as representatives in this place, with all the privileges and income that come with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I implore the Senate to reflect morally on what it is to single out the Northern Territory and the other trial sites, essentially and in a large part for their Indigeneity. The government will say, 'This now applies to everyone in the Northern Territory.' But I take you back to the principle. Is the government about to apply this to Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australiaâ€”to everybody? There are 1.4 million people on JobSeeker payments in our nation. What gives this place the right to start interfering with their budgeting and with their freedom within our society?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These impacts are very real. We leave stupid bureaucratic systems in charge of the fundamental details of people's lives. A person gave evidence to the committee who was a student, a hospitality worker, paying their own rent and earning their own income. Once they finished their study and went onto a JobSeeker payment, they were, of course, also moved onto a cashless debit card. And what did that young person who'd finished their education tell us? They told us that they had lost count of the number of times Indue blocked the payment of their rent. The simple fact is that the cashless debit card is a big bureaucracy that doesn't meet people's needs, that is, their needs to exchange money with family members, to participate in a cash economy, to do basic things like pay their rent. So this afternoon, in this debate, I call on senators to reflect morally on this issue. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  I look forward to a more fulsome debate on this subject when the bill eventually does come before the Senate, but I do want to place a few things on the record and deal with some of the issues that have been raised by those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really do respect the contribution of senators in this place. I don't in any way want to take away or diminish their sincerity and their commitment to the substantive issues that are dealt with when talking about this subject. But, for me and for this government, we certainly believe that every child has the right to feel safe, receive a good education and have high hopes for the future. Yet, through the work that I've done over many years across Australia, particularly in Indigenous communities, I've seen firsthand that not every Australian is afforded those opportunities, sadly. Alcohol and drug fuelled harm, enabled by unaccountable welfare provided to parents or guardians, has robbed far too many children of these rights. But, in those communities where the cashless debit card exists and based on the testimony of people living in those communities, we are thankfully seeing improvements. This is through the trial of a more responsible delivery of welfare, the cashless debit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CDC is a user-friendly, sophisticated bank card that offers participants access to payWave, BPAY, online shopping, recurring deductions and the ability to transfer funds between program accounts. Rent can be paid through it. We've heard testimony here from other senators who said that rent couldn't be paid. That's simply not true. There might have been a situation where there wasn't enough funds in the account and that's why the payment wasn't made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's no technical limitation on a person's ability to pay rent and pay for essential services for their families. When a payment is loaded onto the card, 80 per cent of it is quarantined for bills, groceries and living and school expensesâ€”anything except alcohol, gambling or cash, which could then be used to purchase drugs. The other 20 per cent can be used to purchase any items that don't fall into these categories. I've been on the ground in the trial site communities, speaking to local community leaders and meeting with organisations directly involved in the delivery of the scheme and the wraparound services which support it. Their feedback, along with the evidence, has been very clear: participants have reported consistently that they are drinking less. That doesn't mean every single one of them has been able to deal with their issues. Of course not. No-one has said the cashless debit card is a silver bullet. No-one has said the cashless debit card is going to be the solution to the issues that are there.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been in those communities. I am not some academic at a desktop in Canberra, Melbourne or Sydney. I have been to these places and spoken to people on the ground. What they tell me is that it has become a circuit-breaker, particularly if they are providing social services to the communityâ€”counselling services, drug and alcohol services, and support to the communityâ€”they are telling me it is a circuit-breaker so they can help connect with people.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, a group got together from various parts of the country. It was organised by the Minderoo Foundation. I used to work for the Minderoo Foundation. I was part of the development of the cashless debit card when it was first put to government. The Minderoo Foundation brought together people from the communities in which the cashless debit card operates, including a few other places where they operate the BasicsCard. This legislation before the Senate will replace the BasicsCard, which is a very rudimentary technology. There are only 16,000 merchants across the country who will accept the BasicsCard, whereas there are 900,000 merchants who will accept the cashless debit card, which is essentially just a Mastercard. It can be used at EFTPOS machines right around the country, whereas the BasicsCard is very limited in where it can be used. There were individuals representing themselves at that forum and, in many cases, representing organisations. They were from the Northern Territory and from Cape York in Queensland, where the BasicsCard is in operation. There were Indigenous people and non-Indigenous people in the room when I was there. There were about 50 people who had gathered together. Sadly, because of the border restrictions, the people from Ceduna weren't able to come; but they participated online through Zoom or one of those mediums.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of that forum they wrote a communique, which has just been released. I want to quote one section of it. It says: 'We support the continuation of the cashless debit card as an ongoing income management program to make the existing CDC trial sites permanent and to transition income management in the Northern Territory and Cape York region from the BasicsCard to the CDC.' So this assertion that the communities where the cashless debit card is operating now don't want it, or that it is not supported in the community, is simply not true. If any of us went to a community we would of course find people who don't support it. But the overwhelming sense that you get from people when you speak to them on the ground is that they do support the CDCâ€”the mothers and the grandmothers in particular. They care deeply about their children and they're sick of the humbug, where others come and hassle them for money. If you sit down on the grass with them and listen to them, they'll tell youâ€”when there's not the threat of being ostracised or maybe being abused for speaking out openly, like they did last week when they came to Perthâ€”that they support the extension of this program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great parts of this legislationâ€”just to give comfort to those who are listeningâ€”which was dealt with through the committee process is that it removes the power of the minister, through regulation, to expand it into other communities. Therefore it would require further legislation to come to this place in order to take it anywhere else. At that time, we'd be able to have a debate about the future of it and where it would go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation primarily deals with the fact that the BasicsCard needs to be replaced with a better solution so that when someone runs out of fuel, or is running low on fuel, and drives past a service station which doesn't accept the BasicsCard then they don't run the risk of running out of fuel in driving further down the road where a service station sells fuel by using the BasicsCard. The cashless debit card will be able to be used wherever an EFTPOS machine is. It makes it seamless and frictionless for the participant, and they won't have the hassle that they currently would have with the BasicsCard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is going to help communities across the Northern Territory and across Cape York. Those communities which have the cashless debit card already want the certainty of it going forward, rather than just 12 month, to 12 month to 12 month extensions, so they can continue to build on and deal with the issues that they so desperately want to deal with and to get on top. That's what this bill is about and, ultimately, that's what this report has demonstrated.</span>

I move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I'd just like to put on the record the confidence, professionalism and dedication of the secretariat in preparing the report after assessing a large number of submissions. It's always a pleasure to work with the professional people in the secretariat.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I go into the detail of the report, it's incredible that sometimes in this place the debate preceding an item is very cognisant of the item. This is about regional inequality, and there's no greater area of regional inequality than in some areas of Indigenous activityâ€”the lack of educational opportunities and the like. I enjoyed the contribution of previous senators on the matter and I think a central theme of all of it was that there are areas for improvement by state, local and federal governments which would impact on the topic before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 14 February 2018 the Senate referred an inquiry into the indicators of, and impact of, regional inequality in Australia for inquiry and report by the last sitting day of 2019. This date was subsequently extended. One of the unfortunate things due to the pandemic was that we weren't able to travel as frequently or as far as we would have liked to, but we did get a substantial number of visits in.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As at about 15 December 2019 the committee had received a total of 140 submissions to the inquiryâ€”129 during the 45th Parliament and a further 11 during the 46th Parliamentâ€”and conducted five public hearings in the following regional areas: Emerald, 29 August 2018; Darwin, 5 November 2018; Townsville, 7 November 2018; Port Augusta, 19 November 2019; and Traralgon, 21 November 2019. As I've said, we always get plenty of submissions, plenty of interesting evidence and plenty of good contributions from regional Australia, because there is a necessity to do this systematically and to continue through, no matter who's in government. It doesn't really matter who's in government. This work needs to continue systematically, and the methodology needs to be agreed. Each stakeholder needs to know their part. And we need to get on with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give credit to the other side of the chamber, because I think Senator Payne, in the position of Minister of Defence, took onboard our inquiry into the involvement of Defence spend around their regional bases. We identified some areas of concern and, almost in an eye blink, Senator Payne was on to it and incorporated that strategy of direct involvement, engagement and employment around regional defence bases. I suppose the irony of the chamber is that it was Senator Reynolds who claimed the credit for it; I'm sure Senator Payne had a wry grin when that happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, we've been around, and there's a continual theme in this particular area that shouldn't go unreported or unrecognised, which is the lack of education and training opportunities in regional Australia. The view that education and training were neglected and that they are important to the regions was a common one. A number of submissions argued that it was difficult for people living in the regions to have the same level of access to education as those living in major cities. The Regional Universities Network commented:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is significant inequality in educational attainment between the regional Australia and major cities. Regional Australia is a generation behind in educational attainment compared to major cities, and it may well take a generation or more to address this inequality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This theme is not coming from just one area; it's coming from right around the country. Uniting Country SA, when asked what could be better in terms of support, made this first point:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Investment in education and training opportunities across our regions. We have a lot of people that have to leave their communities to access that sort of service. Policies and procedures that encourage investment from industry within our service area as well to provide greater career opportunities and greater wealth within the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We've got TAFE, and they do offer a range of courses, but there are not enough opportunities.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, once again, if you educate people you need to have a pipeline of opportunity. Without that pipeline of opportunity we're condemning people, in come cases in the Indigenous sector, almost to a lifetime of inequality. If they can't complete high school or if there are no opportunities when they complete high school to go into an apprenticeship or a traineeship then we really have failed those regions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Take the vibrant city of Whyallaâ€”I'm being a bit parochial here, and I apologise to those people I don't mention in the short time I have today, but any senator will tell you that they always take the opportunity to mention their home state firstâ€”Mayor Clare McLaughlin of Whyalla City Council observed:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are a city with ageing infrastructureâ€”both industry and community assetsâ€”with pressure on council's budget to balance financial sustainability against the need to upgrade assets to improve livability.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Continued cost-shifting from other levels of government places significant strain on our ability to ensure financial sustainability in the future whilst managing and upgrading our ageing infrastructure to become a more desirable, livable city. We encourage increased funding allocations to upgrade regional community assetsâ€”something that is integral to our vision for the city.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She went on to say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A lot of our infrastructure is very old. It was built back in the 1970s, when the town was booming. We would definitely appreciate some more fundingâ€”</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">for those sorts of upgrades. This is a continual theme taken up by many communities right around the country: education, infrastructure, opportunity and the like.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time that I have I would like to put on the record that Mr David Ross, director of the Central Land Council, advocated government investment in infrastructure as one of the several recommendations to assist Indigenous people to fill their potential:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government needs to take urgent action to reverse these trends. I know better than most that this problem is complex. However, I believe that there are clear steps that can be taken now to narrow these gaps. These includeâ€¦investing in vital basic infrastructure in remote and very remote areas to improve opportunities for Aboriginal-driven development on Aboriginal land and sea, including in roads, water, power, telecommunications and access to essential health and education services.</span>
                </p>

We have to listen to the Indigenous people who have been in the regions for a long time and explore the opportunities. Even investing in telehealth infrastructure in remote communities would bring about remarkable change.

As the deputy chair of the committee, I will add my thanks to the secretariat and all those who made submissions to the inquiry. I also pay tribute to the role played by Senator Gallacher, who drove this inquiry, and all the senators who participated in the inquiry. Obviously, across the chamber many members of this place wish to see rural and regional Australia advance. There are some additional comments from coalition senators noting some of the very important things that this government is doing in the space: things such as investment in infrastructure and job creation. I note the presence in the chamber of the minister, who has been central to driving some of those changes in terms of jobs programs and the like.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the frustrations of 2020 has been that the committee's plan had been to get out into the regions much more than we were able to do. In light of events of this year, that is the least important thing that has happened this year, but it was a frustration for many of us who would like to have seen this place take its committee work out into the regions much more. Unfortunately, events of this year haven't allowed that, and we all know why. But this is an important report, because it is a very important policy issue. I certainly commend this report for examination to all those listening to this debate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                    </a>  In the time available I'll make a relatively short contribution on this report. For those listening at home, the Senate inquiry into the effectiveness of the Australian government's northern Australia agenda commenced very early in this term. It was always intended to be a fairly long running inquiry to give the Senate an opportunity to review just exactly how the government's northern Australia agenda is progressing. What we've done today is table an interim report of the committee. The intention is that the final report of this committee will be tabled at the end of March next year. Like every inquiry that's been conducted over this term, this inquiry has, of course, been disrupted by COVID-19, particularly with the limitations on travel. That's been especially an issue for this inquiry, given that, by its very nature, it involves travelling and hearing from people in some of the most remote parts of this country. Of course, that hasn't been possible as much as we would have liked this year, which is the reason for the extension of this inquiry into next year. But, notwithstanding that, today's interim report, I think, does make some important recommendations to the government about how it can improve the performance of probably its key funding mechanism for the northern Australia agenda, which is the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, the NAIF. I'll come back to that, shortly, and what the committee has recommended for the NAIF.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on record my thanks to the other committee members: Senator McDonald, the deputy chair of the committee; my colleagues from Labor, Senators McCarthy and Dodson; and Senator Roberts, Senator Siewert and Senator Dean Smith. Again, travel limitations have made it a little bit difficult for people to participate in all the hearings, but I do appreciate the efforts that everyone has put in. I do want to thank everyone as well for reaching a unanimous position in this interim report. That's, obviously, not always possible, so I think we've handled ourselves very maturely, and no doubt we can continue to do that in the course of this inquiry. Can I also thank the secretariat, who worked very hard over this inquiry on the logistics and, of course, the preparation of this report. We do all very much appreciate your efforts and your beavering away to get this report done behind the scenes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have achieved to date are a number of hearings in Darwin, Townsville, Mount Isa, Mackay and Nhulunbuy in Arnhem Land. Over the last few months, particularly since COVID hit, we have made a point of this inquiry continuing and have undertaken a number of hearings by teleconference so that we do keep it progressing and we continue to hear from witnesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the decision we made was that the interim report should focus on the NAIF, partly because it is the only funding mechanism that is within the portfolio of northern Australia and partly because it is a body that has, in my view, attracted quite a lot of deserved attention and, in some quarters, criticism. Also, the government themselves were conducting a review of the NAIF over the last few months, and we thought it important that the committee did bring down an interim report to provide some recommendations to government which they can hopefully listen to and act on when it comes time to legislating some changes to the NAIF.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to recognise that the northern Australia minister, Mr Pitt, has already announced that there will be a number of changes made to the NAIF, which is very welcome, from the point of view of both the opposition and, I think, the committee as a whole, given the recommendations that we've made. We haven't seen the legislation yet, but, certainly, what I've seen from the minister does look encouraging. It does seem that the government recognises that there are some pretty significant changes that need to be made to the NAIF so that it does work effectively, so that it does get money out the door and so that it does build the projects and create the jobs that it was intended to. It's well known that I have been a very strong critic of the NAIF up until now. As I made clear at the Developing Northern Australia Conference in Rockhampton last week, my criticism is not of the officials of the NAIF or its board members. I think it has lacked political direction and political leadership, and I am pleased to see some of these changes that the minister is now flagging. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said before, I just don't think it's acceptable that, five years after this body was first announced, we see only $218 million of its $5 billion budget having actually been released to fund projects. That's less than 5c in the dollar released five years after this body was first announced. We of course hear from the government on a regular basis that the NAIF has approved funding of over $2 billion for projects, and that's very good, but what they never want to accept and acknowledge is that the amount of money that's actually flowing out the door is considerably less than thatâ€”$218 million. What that really means, not just in numerical terms, is that we've got billions of dollars of lost opportunities for northern Australia, which is particularly important now as we are in recession and as we're starting to recover from COVID. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, as I made clear in my speech to the Developing Northern Australia Conference last week, there are some incredible opportunities in northern Australia as we recover from COVID. There's renewed interest in decentralisation and in people moving out of big cities, particularly in the southern states, which have borne the burden of COVID-19 and its lockdowns. I was in Darwin a couple of weeks ago, and people are really excited about the fact that the population there is increasing for the first time in some time. You can actually feel a bit more energy and optimism in places like Darwin than we have seen for some time. So it is important that the government takes this opportunity that we've been given through COVID, where people are thinking about things differently, to really drive this Northern Australia agenda home and deliver on its expectations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report makes a number of recommendations as to how the NAIF can be improved. These recommendations go beyond the changes the government has already flagged. The report acknowledges the changes to the NAIF that the government has flagged and congratulates it on doing so. But the committee as a whole does think there are some other amendments and changes that could be made to the NAIF. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recommendations include broadening the eligibility for the NAIF to allow for funding of smaller projects and a broader range of industries. A main piece of feedback that I've received, both through the inquiry and on separate work as the shadow minister, is that one of the problems with the NAIF is that, up until now, it has focused on the funding of large projects, in the tens of millions of dollars or hundreds of millions of dollars. While there are some projects of that scale kicking around in northern Australia and seeking financing, there are a lot more projects that are much smaller in nature but do need finance through this government facility and have found it very difficult to access that funding through the NAIF. So we are recommending in this report that the NAIF have a good look at its eligibility criteria and its focus to make sure that it is paying enough attention and providing enough support to those smaller projects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also recommended that the government consider converting some of the NAIF's funds to grants, equity stakes and guarantees. That would, of course, have fiscal implications for the government, and that's why we have simply recommended that they consider doing so, rather than outright recommending it. But, again, the evidence the committee has received does suggest that converting some of these funds to grants, equity stakes and guarantees would provide a better funding vehicle for those small-scale projects I was talking about but also, in particular, projects being led by First Nations communities. I have said before that, given the proportion of the northern Australian community who are from First Nations communities, given the higher levels of disadvantage we continue to see in First Nations communities and given the fact that, in the Northern Territory alone, 50 per cent of the land is Aboriginal owned, we have to make sure that the interests of First Nations people are at the centre of the Northern Australia agenda, and the NAIF has a role to play in delivering that as well. There are other recommendations we've made in this report, such as ensuring that NAIF funded projects do a better job of buying locally and of sourcing labour locally so that we do see that local spin-off out of NAIF projects. We have continued to recommend that there be greater transparency and accountability from the NAIF in relation to things like the bonuses it pays.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All in all, what we're saying in this report is that the NAIF is a worthwhile institution that needs to get moving. We hope this will happen. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ there was no legal authority evident to the ANAO under which the Minister was able to be the approver of CSIG program grants to be paid from the money of Sport Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry's been going on for some time. The government all along has thought that, under the cover of the pandemic, they would escape scrutiny for what they did with this sports rorts program. Can I tell you this: they're not going to escape that inquiry. The Australian people want some answers about what went on here and, more particularly, the sports community wants to know what's gone on here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More particularly still, all of those sporting organisations and all of those volunteers who originally looked at the criteria for the grants of applicationsâ€”heaps and heaps and heaps of money that was supposed to go to sporting clubsâ€”and toiled away, night after night, thought they were entering a legitimate process the government had set up to distribute the sporting grants. Of course, we have no problem with sporting organisations getting money, but the government misled the Australian people and misled all of these volunteers in these sporting clubs into thinking that there would be a legitimate process for the distribution of these funds, that if they had a good project and scored well with Sport Australia they were going to be awarded one of these grants. That's what they thought. But what did we find out? Nothing of the sort occurred. In fact, as each tranche of money was handed out by then Minister McKenzie, the situation got worse and worseâ€”fewer clubs with high scores were awarded and the government handed this money over to their own marginal seats or seats that they were trying to win. The whole process was a fraud right from the start. At no stage was there any legitimacy to this process. All of those hardworking volunteers now know that's what happened here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are we discussing this here today? Earlier in the year, when Sport Australia came along and gave some evidence, they said us to: 'You tell us what documents you want and we'll hand them over. We've got nothing to hide. The government has nothing to hide about this. We want to explain what we've done.' They said that at one of the first hearings into this matter. But what's happened? We haven't got the documents, despite the inquiry now going for nine months or so and despite a decision earlier this week of the Senate making it very clear that the Senate wants to see these documents. We still haven't got the documents. This response by Sport Australia today makes it clear we're still not going to get them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, the government think that they can hide from scrutiny during the pandemic and that somehow the issue of what they did throughout this process to disrespect sporting clubs in this country and the way that they handed out the funds is going to go away. Let me tell you: the issue is not going to go away. Somebody is going to have to take responsibility for this. I know Senator McKenzie has gone, but it's very clear from what we found out about her role in this process that she was just doing the bidding of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was giving the instructions as to exactly where these funds had to go so as to maximise the chances of the government being re-elected. That is what it was all about. It was nothing to do with the fair distribution of sporting funds to Australian sporting clubs. It had everything to do with the re-election of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not going to leave it here. The government might think that they can hide from scrutiny by sending in letters like the one that they've given to the Senate late on a Thursday afternoon, but we are not going to leave it there. We have two very fine senators on the jobâ€”Senator Chisholm and Senator Greenâ€”and they've got their teeth into this. I can see Senator Cash smiling because she knows that what I'm saying is true. Even Senator Brockman is smiling, I can see. He's got his head down for a change. They know that the Australian people are going to find out what went on here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think I know what went on here. I think poor old Senator McKenzie simply did what she was instructed to do by the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's Office to win the last election. There was no accountability and no transparency. The government, like most other people, thought they were going to lose the election and so it didn't really matter and they were never going to be held responsible for the irresponsible way in which they distributed these funds. But those two senators I mentioned, two very fine senators from Queensland, are on the job. They've got their teeth into this issue. If the government thinks that, somehow, by delaying this process they will escape scrutiny, then they have another think coming, because, day by day, week by week and month by month, we will continue to pursue this government to get the truth out of what has gone on here.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to this debate with regard to this ministerial statement, particularly the letter that's been tabled today by the minister relating to the refusal by the government, via Sport Australia, to comply with a request from the Senate to provide documents for the Senate inquiry into the sports grants saga. I'll make clear to the Senate that these documents relate to the legal authority the minister had to make decisions about these grants. We have always questioned whether the minister actually had the legal authority to make these decisions. It is a concern that many legal submissions made to the committee have questioned the legal authority that the minister had. The only basis that the public has for believing that the minister had legal authority to make these decisions is a piece of legal advice that the Attorney-General has hold of but will not make public. That is the only information that we have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the letter, the acting chair of Sport Australia noted that there are current legal proceedings on foot. But I want to make clear to the Senate that the members of this committee have gone about this in a very deliberate way. We understand that legal professional privilege isn't always a ground for a public interest immunity claim and that when there are legal proceedings on foot we do need to be careful in that respect. We have asked for this evidence to be in camera so we can at least understand what advice Sport Australia had and what understanding they had about the minister's legal authority. We have asked for it to be in camera and it has not been provided. That's why the interim report put a recommendation to the Senate, and the Senate supported that recommendation. The Senate supported the recommendation to request this information because it's crucial for the public to understand how badly the government mismanaged taxpayer funds, when it came to making decisions about who would receive this money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there are so many circumstances in this saga that the government is refusing to make public. There are numerous documents that the government has refused to make public, and not just to our inquiry. Everyone is familiar with the Gaetjens report. The Prime Minister wasn't happy with the Auditor-General's report and what that said, so he went to get his own report from Mr Gaetjens. That report was completed andâ€”what do you know!â€”it said that nothing was wrong here, that nothing untoward had been done, and that we don't need to worry about this matter anymore. But that report has not been made public. Not a single member of the public, a single member of the Senate or anyone on this committee has had the opportunity to read that report so we can understand what questions were asked, what witnesses were questioned and what documents the report had access to. Without that information, this committee, the Senate and members of the public can only conclude that the government is covering this up. Otherwise, you would release the information and make it public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it a concern? We know that the government ran a parallel process. The minister, in conjunction with the Prime Minister's officeâ€”there were 136 emailsâ€”ran a parallel process to make recommendations about where these funds should go. Sport Australia had a merit assessment process. They scored applications. People who have experience with sportâ€”understanding where these funds should go and assessing applications on their meritâ€”were the ones who made the decision. When that list made its way over to the minister's office, the Prime Minister intervened and said: 'No, no, no. We've got an election coming up. We need to make sure there are enough announcements in our marginal seats so we can stand next to a big cheque, get a photo and make sure this money is going to people for their votes'â€”not to the people who might need the money, not to the sporting clubs that had done the hard work to make sure they had a really good application. They made sure this money only went to the people whose votes they needed. That is not how the government should be handing out taxpayer funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another reason why the government doesn't want to let anyone know the truth of this scandal. Senator Farrell is right: we are not letting this go. We are not letting this go because when we finally get these documents they will show that the Prime Minister was intimately involved in this scandal. There were 136 emails back and forth between the Prime Minister's office and the minister's office. They included several examples of the colour-coded spreadsheet, and changes to that spreadsheet were requested by the Prime Minister's office multiple times. They were working with CHQ, their campaign headquarters, to make these changes. It was a politicised process; it shouldn't have been. None of these sporting clubs were told, 'Don't bother applying unless you live in one of our marginal seats.' That is what people need to know. How was this process allowed to occur?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to draw the Senate's attention to one of the documents that we have received. I think it shines a light on why we know this government is not going to provide any other documents, why this government is going to ignore a resolution of the Senate. This is an email from the executive director of sports partnerships in Sport Australia on 5 December 2018. It is one of the documents that we have actually managed to get, through the estimates process and through this inquiry. It goes to show that, when we do get the documents, they paint a very grim picture for this government. This email, sent to the Prime Minister's office and cc'd to the CEO of Sport Australia, refers to the changes the minister has made to the decisions in this program. It says: 'We also recognise your comments that, in making changes to the approved list, the minister's office used a ratings scale provided by Sport Australia as a reference. But the minister is advised that, as the delegate, she may need to defend the decisions at Senate estimates'â€”that is, if changes were made she could not state that she approved the recommended decisions in the industry panel that followed due process where a rigorous, transparent and defensible process took place. Sport Australia tried to warn the minister that she shouldn't go down this road, because she would end up having to answer questions about not following the recommendations of Sport Australia. We know that the government was warned. We know that good people in Sport Australia had very grave concerns about this process and they raised those concerns with the minister. They said to the minister, 'Hey, wait a secondâ€”you might not want to go down this track, because, if you do, you'll be doing the wrong thing.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But those in the government didn't care. All they had in their sights was the election and getting themselves re-elected. It was all about protecting their own jobsâ€”about getting themselves back into their cushy jobsâ€”and not about doing the right thing by the sporting clubs and the people who made these applications and the people in the public who expect better from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This letter today is not unexpected, but it is unacceptable. It is unacceptable that a committee of the Senate and the Senate itself is not being given the information it needs to understand what has gone wrong here. We know the reason that we are not being given this information: it's because the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, was at the head of this scandal. The more documents we receiveâ€”because we're not giving upâ€”the more they will show that the Prime Minister led the sports rorts scandal and he let Minister McKenzie take the fall. And we're not going to stop until we've found them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  What we've learnt today is that, whilst Minister Colbeck wasn't responsible for administering sports rorts, he was an accomplice in the cover-up. The minister has had 12 months to be honest with the Australian people and this parliament, to come in and explain what has gone on, to provide answers to those volunteers, those mums and dadsâ€”all those people who gave up so much of their time, in good faith, to apply, following the guidelines that were put forward by Sport Australia. They put in the volunteer hoursâ€”and we've heard from so many clubs this year about how many hours they dedicated to putting in a submissionâ€”and then they were dudded by this government, and all for political reasons. Yet those in the government don't have the good grace to come in and be upfront with those people who volunteered their time, tell them what's gone on and admit that this was all about their re-election. That was what their focus was on the whole time. So it is absolutely outrageous that, on this program, their political decision-making was paramount. They are treating this Senate with contempt by not providing the legal advice todayâ€”and I will come to that in more detail shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They absolutely need to level with the Australian people. They need to fund those clubs that this government duddedâ€”those clubs that received a high score and were judged as deserving by Sport Australia but were dudded. We know who they are. The government should do the right thing and fund those clubs. We've had a budget since this, and the government still failed to do it in the budget. But it's not too late. So many of those clubs that came and gave evidence to us are still desperate to have these upgrades. The work they have done in putting forward their submissions needs to be rewarded. We heard from so many worthy groups, councils and Indigenous councils who want to encourage young people to get involved in sport and to give Indigenous people an opportunity, in a place like Woorabinda, to play at a football ground with club rooms and appropriate facilities. We know that there's been much growth in women's sport, in particular, and that women's sport has been neglected. We've heard the stories about the women who have to change in their car or out the back of the club rooms, which is clearly not appropriate. And it is this government that's responsible for those things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen a pattern of behaviourâ€”not answering questions on this and not providing legal adviceâ€”as they try to cover up what really went on. They won't answer questions such as: 'What was the involvement of the Prime Minister and his office?' We know that there were 136 emails between the minister's office and the Prime Minister's office about this program. We know that they won't even release the spreadsheets to us. So the committee has not seen the spreadsheets that the ministers made their decisions on. We haven't seen any of those. They won't release them to us. We haven't seen the Gaetjens report. We haven't seen the talking points about extending this program that were prepared for Minister McKenzie's meeting with the Prime Minister and his office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Farrell said in his speech, as it got closer to the election, the political decision-making got worse. In round 1, it was 40 per cent ignored. In round 2, it was 70 per cent ignored. By round 3, as the election was imminent, it was 73 per cent ignored. The closer the election got, the more political the decision-making got. We also have no idea who authorised the five additional projects that were granted funding after caretaker kicked in. Caretaker applied, they still gave out five more grants, and we're none the wiser about who was responsible for that. That is just outrageous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's get to the substance of today's legal advice. It was against the request of the Senate, on the authority of the then Minister McKenzieâ€”to authorise grants as part of sports rorts is just another example in a long saga of the LNP government's lack of transparency and accountability. The letter from Sport Australia today claims that, due to legal proceedings commencing on 23 July this year, they are concerned that the Australian Sports Commission's interests may be adversely affected if the legal professional privilege applicable to the advice is prejudiced by the requirement to table this advice summary. The ASC's claim, however, doesn't explain why the minister made a PII claim on 16 July, before any legal proceedings had been commenced. There was a failure of the minister to come in here and address that issue specifically. This is even though the Beechworth Lawn Tennis Club, who asked for a $500,000 grantâ€”and they were a high-scoring club, with 78/100; that's well above the threshold identified by the Audit Office of being eligibleâ€”requested that Sport Australia review their decision on 4 March this year. Sport Australia were still prepared to provide a confidential briefing of legal advice to the committee in May. Sport Australia again makes the claim that, on the basis of legal professional privilege, they should not be required to table the legal advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, legal professional privilege has not been accepted in the Senate's grounds for refusing to provide information or documents. The Senate has rejected government claims that there is a longstanding practice of not disclosing legal advice. Legal advice to the federal government is often disclosed by the government itself. As in the letter and the PII claim itself, the disclosure of the information may materially affect the Commonwealth's position in pending legal proceedings. The committee was not satisfied with thatâ€”and that the correspondent explains the specific harm to the public interest that would result. Again, there has been no explanation as to the risk of providing a confidential briefing to the committee in camera, as the committee said we were happy to accept. Further, it needs to be stated that we consider this information vital evidence for the inquiry as it goes to the very legal foundations of the program and whether then Minister McKenzie even had the legal authority to be authorising these grants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legal experts the committee has heard from have all been unable to find the suggested legal authority the then Minister McKenzie claims to have had to make these grants. I went through some of these issues with the legal authorities. We heard from Professor Lindell. We heard from Professor Twomey. These are experts in constitutional law. They could not identify the legal authority that the minister had to be the decision-maker in this process. It's not enough that it was in the guidelines. That is irrelevant. They had to identify the legal authority, and they were unable to do it. This is why we have pursued this. Sport Australia were originally happy to give us the summary in camera, which we had agreed to. But then it was Minister Colbeck who claimed the PII, which is why we've brought it to the Senate and why the Senate voted for that in the debate on the interim report on Tuesday night. So we will continue to pursue it, but we will continue to pursue a whole range of issues, and that's why the sports rorts inquiry will be going on into next year. We had an aim to finish it this year, but the fact that the government won't cooperate makes it all the more necessary to continue to pursue it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what are the 136 emails between the minister's office and the Prime Minister's office discussing this scheme? What is the content of those? Give us access to the spreadsheets so that we can see which clubs missed out and what scores they received, and so that we can actually talk to them and let them tell their story. Some of the compelling evidence we have seen this year, the most compelling evidence we have seen this year, has come from those volunteers, those mums and dads that I talked about, who put in the work and were dudded by this government. They deserve the opportunity to be heard. They also deserve the opportunity to ask this government to do the right thing and fund those clubs that received the highest scores.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to pursue the legal authority, because it puts the very basis of this program in doubt and the government haven't been able to provide assurances. The Gaetjens report, which is another document the government haven't released, actually goes to the heart of why Minister McKenzie lost her job. What was in those talking points that were prepared for then Minister McKenzie for her meeting with the Prime Minister as they discussed future rounds of this program? What led to the political decision-making that we saw? And who approved those five projects after caretaker had been started? This is a fundamental element of democracy, but this government have not provided any answers for that at all, and there are five projects out there that were given grants with no authority.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate notes that the current dispute between China and Australia is more deep-seated than a trade spat involving wine, coal and timber.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion I moved is the opening paragraph in Robert Gottliebsen's newspaper article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> yesterday, and I'll quote it again:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When China declared that Australia had been "evil" it suddenly became clear that the dispute between the two nations is more deep-seated than a trade spat involving wine coal, timber etc.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia who is involved in the governance of Australia, I want to focus on Gottliebsen's meaty fourth paragraph:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">From President Xi down, there has been little respect for Australia for a long time and many in China believe we are a foolish country that makes mistakes at almost every turn, led by defence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He then details serious flaws in the governance of three Defence projects, the submarine 'shemozzle', as he calls it, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and the Hunter frigates. We obviously are 'a foolish country' based on this, and the obvious point of his article is our shoddy governments over many decades, both Liberal-National and Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in this country are feeling concerned about the seriously deteriorating state of our country. We have lost our economic sovereignty. We're losing our national sovereignty. We're plunging towards catastrophe economically, and dependence with a complete loss of security. People are fed up and, across many communities and industriesâ€”and I mean right around the countryâ€”people are feeling dispirited, hopeless, confused, aimless, wary, concerned and even fearful, because most can sense our country's destruction. Yet, 100 years ago Australia was No. 1 in the world in income per person and had the highest GDPâ€”gross domestic productâ€”per person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a worse aspect beyond economic demise though. Bullies like China prey on those perceived as being weak. Gottliebsen rightly says that, due to poor, and even stupid, decisions, we're rightly perceived as being weak in defence. Yet he barely scratches the full extent of the deterioration of our security, because our productive capacity has been dismantled, and our economic security has been smashed, destroyed. We are vulnerable. Now, as a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, that is what I will discuss, because, like bullies in a schoolyard or in a workplace, China preys on those it perceives as weak or foolish. By the way, when I raise China, I refer to the Chinese Communist Party and not the millions of Australians of Chinese descent now in our country, descendants of those who came during the gold rushes almost two centuries ago, and those who immigrated more recently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only does the Chinese Communist Party assess other nations against China's values and standards; the Chinese Communist Party assesses our country against our own values, and from that it finds out: Does our government have courage? Does our government have integrity? Do the politicians in this country and this parliament have the strength of character needed to lead a country? I've been thinking about this for some years now and I've made a list of Australian values: mateship; a fair go; support; loyalty; being fair dinkum; telling the truth; honesty; fairness; freedom to live; freedom of speech; freedom of thought; freedom of belief; freedom of religion; freedom of faith; freedom of interaction; freedom of exchange; democracy; our flag; our nation; family; care; respect for people; respect for community; respect for the law; respect for the environment; making sure government fulfils its three primary roles, which are protecting life, protecting property and protecting freedom, and stays out of everything else; and our Constitution. We value our Constitution, especially competitive federalism, and we value human progress. Australia has led that improvement in progress in the past 150 years. It has been amazing progress, right across the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's assess governments against these values and their impact on our productive capacity. Productive capacity depends on many things, but particularly energy costsâ€”the primacy of energy. An ever-decreasing cost of energy has led to 150 years of human progress. Australia has gone from having the world's lowest electricity prices to having the world's highest, yet we're now the world's largest exporter of energyâ€”gas and coal. China imports a lot of our coal, but the production of coal in their own country is eight times our total productionâ€”not just our exports but our total production. They make us look like small producers of coal. They have the largest coal reserves in the world, along with the United States. They use our coal. They're building steel power plants out of our coal, and they're building hundreds of coal-fired power stations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We legislate to use their wind turbines and their solar panels. We subsidise them. It drives up the cost of our electricity, and we pay them for unreliablesâ€”their solar and wind generators. We pay them for components of electric vehicles, which we also subsidise. And then we have Chinese companies, affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, owning electricity networks in our major cities. Then we have the Queensland Labor government stealing $1Â½ billion a year through the generators. All of this destroys jobs and destroys competitiveness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then taxpayers pay people, quite often foreigners, to come in and squat on the land, just to get carbon dioxide credits. It's called carbon dioxide farming. It takes good farmland and destroys it with noxious weeds and feral animalsâ€”pestsâ€”and then that has to be reclaimed at some later date; who knows when. Then we have Angus Taylor, the Minister for Energy and Emissions, a farmer. He knows that the EPBC Act is hurting himâ€”I've had conversations with himâ€”but he just smiles, rolls his eyes and puts up with it. He is a sceptic on climate changeâ€”sceptical that we are affecting the climate. He's been slammed, and he's now coming back into parliament and driving up electricity prices. Matt Canavan, Barnaby Joyce: strong sceptics in their beliefs. Barnaby Joyce was the Deputy Prime Minister. The Chinese know that. They watch him. They saw him come into cabinet and they saw him run for election in New England, when he moved out of the Senate and into the lower house. And Malcolm Turnbull, to get Mr Joyce elected, showered $400 million of taxpayer funds on unreliable wind power. Then Matt Canavan and Barnaby Joyce were both in the cabinet, and they suddenly became alarmists, spouting alarm about carbon dioxide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I asked Matt Canavan in the Senate one day where his evidence was, and he just slid away from me. Now that he's out of cabinet and Mr Joyce is out of cabinet, all of a sudden they're becoming a little bit sceptical again in their words. But the Chinese Communist Party see this and that tells them a lot about the lack of leadership in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Chinese have their own agreement within the Paris Agreement. It says, 'We will continue doing whatever we want, continue growing our economy, continue constructing our country, developing our country and putting in place infrastructure, and then in 2030 we may consider something.' Meanwhile, this parliament in this building has legislated to destroy our economy to comply with Kyoto. That's not an agreement; that is stupidity and economic suicide. The Chinese Communist Party watches us pay academics to tell lies about climate and to misrepresent the climate science. We even put some of them in charge of or in senior places in the CSIRO and pay them $800,000 a year to destroy our country. Dr Andrew Johnson went from head of the climate research agency department in the CSIRO to become head of the Bureau of Meteorology. Under him and his predecessors, the Bureau of Meteorology has been shown to be concocting the data and misrepresenting temperatures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We pay people like Ove Hoegh-Gulberg and Ian Chubb, former chief scientists, to destroy the science, to misrepresent the science. In 1975, Whitlam signed an agreement saying we'll comply with the Lima Declaration to shut down our manufacturing and export it. The following year, Liberal Prime Minister Fraser ratified the deal. In 1992, Paul Keating's Labor government signed the Rio Declaration, which is about 21st century global governance. Then we had the Kyoto protocol destroying our country, stealing our farmers' property rights. And now we have the Paris Agreement exporting jobs and shutting manufacturing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the current Prime Minister has the temerity to say, 'We will fiddle with the industrial relations system to bring back manufacturing.' How the hell can you bring back manufacturing when you have the highest electricity costs in the world and a big component of manufacturingâ€”the largest component, usuallyâ€”is the cost of electricity? How the hell can you do it with a tax system that favours multinational companies and lets them off scot-free? How the hell can you do it with overregulation? How the hell can you do it with a lack of water? How the hell can you do it with a lack of infrastructure? The Chinese are watching this and they're helping us destroy our electricity sector and export even more jobs, because our prices for electricity are going up, businesses are shutting and then the jobs start up in China.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now reversing the last 170 years of human progress, because the key to human progress is decreasing the price of energy, which raises productivity, raises wealth, raises the standard of living. That ended in this country 24 years ago. We have ceded governance to the UN: Lima, Kyoto, Rio, Paris and many other agreements. How does this comply with Aussie values? How does it comply with being fair dinkum? Worse, the granddaddy who concocted this climate change rubbish was Maurice Strong. He concocted it when he created and then took over as head of the United Nations Environment Program. He pushed that program, starting from the 1970s, and in the 1980s he ramped it up. In 1988 he formed the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a fraudulent organisation. And the Liberals, Labor, the Nationals and the Greens have fallen for it all. Maurice Strong was a crook. He was wanted by the police in America and died in exile in China. Who's the beneficiary of all this destruction of Western civilisation? The Chinese government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the people in this chamber and the chamber across the hall there have done to this country by blindly following the UN diktats. How does that comply with our values? It doesn't. It breaks our values. What about water ownership? Destroyed by separating water ownership from property ownership. What about the Murray-Darling Basin and the corruption that is rife? What about the family farms shutting down? What about water projects? What water projects? That's it; there aren't any. And yet look at what amazing water projects the Chinese Communist Party has put together to develop its country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about infrastructure? Hardly anything built and no plan. The north is exposed without the Bradfield scheme and we see floods destroying Townsville. There is destruction and a waste of water flowing out to sea. We see the state governments joining in. The Labor Party in Queensland has reef regulations which are shutting down agriculture. Vegetation protection legislation is destroying agriculture. Firebreaks aren't allowed and are being destroyed when farms are under fire. We put animals and fungus ahead of humans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland Labor government put a Chinese company in charge of the electoral roll and then there is Queensland local council corruption linked to the Labor state government. This extends well beyond Ipswich and Paul Pisasale; it is systemic and it is widespread. We have foreign banks that were deregulated under John Howard and we saw the result of that through the Hayne royal commission. We see Adani frustrated by both the Liberal-National and Labor governments in Queensland and by the federal government, which was weak. That's one man from India, which has a booming, growing economy, who wanted to spend $17 billion in our country. He was thwarted for eight years. That's a blight on us that not even the Chinese can missâ€”that no-one in the world can miss. We go on and on and on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I give Senator Rex Patrick credit for moving a motion to get an inquiry into the relationship between China and Australia six timesâ€”and I supported him every time. Both the Labor Party and the Liberal-Nationals squashed it. This is what the Chinese are seeing, yet Australians are wanting far more. Australians want leadership. Australians want security, reassurance, confidence, leadership, trust, pride and freedomâ€”a restoration so that we can be No. 1 in the world again. What does Australia need? It needs principled leadership based on values. It needs disciplined leadership based on data and facts instead of ideology paying off donors. It needs honest leadership and strength of character. It's the simple ability to say: 'I'm wrong, I'm sorryâ€”can you help me? Please explain.' We need visionary policies, and that is what will take us back to being No. 1.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  I rise to speak in this debate. I note the time, so I'll keep my contribution very short to give others an opportunity, albeit a very short one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that perhaps it would be the understatement of the yearâ€”and we have had many serious issues to consider this yearâ€”to say that we are seeing an aggressively assertive China in the way it is dealing with the rest of the world. But I think it's very important to make the point that Australia's position in standing up for its own position in the world and its own sovereignty, making decisions based on our national interest, has not changed. We are a trading nation and we are a nation which supports the free flow of trade and goods according to international rules and norms. That's something that we expect to benefit all nations and we certainly hope that all nations commit to that as well, including China.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for China to explain itself and its actions. We have always welcomed China's economic growth, and trade has lifted many people out of poverty right across the world and right across the region. We need to make sure that all nations in the world engage with each other in a way that is respectful of each country's sovereignty. We support the peaceful development and prosperity of our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, Australia is now facing a number of trade issues in our relationship with China. Some of them are very recent and some of them date back a number of years. Clearly, the rhetoric has escalated in the last few weeks and months. The cumulative impact of these issues means that the perception is growing, particularly following Ambassador Cheng's remarks in April, that there are other factors driving China's trade actions against Australia. But Australia has not descended into tit for tat. We have been calmâ€”the Morrison government has been calmâ€”we have been consistent and we have been measured. It is a matter for the Chinese authorities to explain plainly and clearly what is driving these concerning actions which are disrupting our bilateral trade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this is a very important matter and the clock is ticking down. I'm sure we'll have many more opportunities over the week ahead, and certainly into next year, to discuss these matters further. I will leave my contribution there for now.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator AYRES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  I appreciate being given a few minutes at this juncture to make some comments on behalf of the Labor Party. I, too, will try to finish in time to give Senator Patrick a few minutes. On the face of it, Senator Roberts' notice of motion is pretty anodyne. Labor will be supporting the proposition. I did have some misgiving, though, that it would be the vehicle for the kind of bellicose language that Senator Roberts is prone to giving, and those misgivings proved to be well-founded. He did cite an article by Mr Gottliebsen yesterday that talked about people regarding Australia as foolish. I don't accept that characterisation. Senator Roberts has made no small contribution himself to the view that many countries across the region have about some of the darker recesses of Australian thinking in relation to the region.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>While he's free to speak his mind, words have consequences. It didn't take too long there to move from views about the government of China to an alleged one-world government, across to the Bradfield scheme and the usual rhetorical flourishes that Senator Roberts has about things that move from the real to the world of conspiracy theories very, very quickly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the resolution says, this is a more deep-seated problem than a trade spat. The language 'trade spat' I think is an effort to diminish the seriousness of the economic issues and trade issues that confront the country. Peabody coal announced today that it would be standing workers down at its Helensburgh mine for eight weeksâ€”very high-quality metallurgical coal exported around the world. That is a very serious issue in the Hunter Valley. The resolution touches on timber, wine and coal. But lobsters, sugar, copper, beef, wheat and barley are all important regional industries and important regional employers. Many, many tens of thousands of jobs rest upon those industries. What I want to see is a more thorough, thoughtful, careful and strategic debate within this parliament over the course of 2021. And I want to see a more thoughtful, strategic approach and, indeed, a plan from the Morrison government, about how we're going to deal with not just the trade questions but about Australia's relationships across the region, including our relationship with China.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that the Morrison government has failed to prepare Australia for the new realities in the region. Mr Morrison has no plan to diversify Australia's export markets and no plan to deepen our relationships with the other countries in the region. Just today the Morrison government has put a bill through the Senate that confirms it's solely responsible for foreign relations. That means Mr Morrison and the minister need to show leadership and actually take responsibility, instead of just using foreign policy as another vehicle for slogans and splashy headlines. As a result, Mr Morrison has made a bad situation worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Foreign policy and strategy are not just about events. When significant events have occurred, the Labor Party, our leader, Mr Albanese, the leader here, Senator Wong, and our spokesperson on foreign policy have supported the government in a bipartisan way. Whether it's events like the disgraceful tweet from earlier this week, the Labor Party has provided bipartisan support. But strategy isn't about events; strategy is about having a clear view of what the national interest is, a clear construction of what is in the interests of Australia and Australians and then prosecuting a strategy that delivers a good outcome for the country in terms of our economy and in terms of regional peace, stability and economic growth across the regionâ€”of course, a strategy that's consistent with Australia's values. The problem is that there has been a clear articulation of those positions across previous governments but there has been a sense of strategic drift and lack of a policy approach from this government over the course of the last seven years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  I rise in this adjournment debate to make a few short remarks in relation to a delightful event I attended on 26 November 2020, which was the opening of the Bertram Shallcross bridge within the jurisdiction of Somerset Regional Council. The Australian government contributed over $600,000 to the rebuilding of this bridge, the demolition of the existing bridge, construction of a new two-lane bridge and minor changes to road alignment. That funding of $606,574 under round 3 of the Bridges Renewal Program was matched by the Somerset Regional Council, who contributed the sum of $618,469. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The major benefit of the renewal, the rebuilding, the replacement of this bridge is that it will reduce trips by 6.5 kilometres compared to the state highway in the local area, improving safety and increasing flood immunity. Vehicle traffic has been increasing on the route since the bridge was completed. In fact, my speech contributing to the event to open the bridge was drowned out from time to time by the great lot of traffic that was going across the newly constructed bridge. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to convey the substance of the remarks I made at the bridge opening, and that included my congratulations to the Somerset Regional Council, led by the indefatigable mayor, Councillor Graeme Lehmann, who might be the longest serving current mayor in Queenslandâ€”or at least he's one of them. He's provided outstanding representation to the Somerset region, in conjunction with all of the councillors. On the day, when I wasn't being drowned out by the increased traffic arising from the construction of this great bridge, I said that, for any infrastructure the federal government contributes to the cost of that is undertaken and executed by Somerset Regional Council, the federal government knows that the Somerset Regional Council will make sure it's well costed, well planned and well executed. That was certainly the case with respect to this bridge. I pay tribute to all the Somerset Regional Council workers who worked on the bridge and also to the SES volunteers from the local area who assisted with the opening ceremony. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should say I did not open the bridge. I was delighted to witness the opening of the bridge by Mrs Carmel Shallcross, the widow of Mr Bertram Shallcross. I must say that she did a wonderful job in opening the bridge, and it was a great honour to be in her presence and also in the presence of some of her family members. I'd like to quote to you from an email I received from Jeff Shallcross, the son of Carmel, who gave an overview with respect to the contribution made by the Shallcross family in that region. He said: 'The Shallcross family has been within the district for a very long time. We moved from the Mount Mee area in the 1890s to Highwood Lane, Kilcoy, then selected the property Deerhurst on New Country Creek in 1916. As part of the selection, scrub had to be cleared and farming started. The family of Bertram Shallcross's wife, Carmel, who opened the bridge, the Ruckers, owned Wattle Glen next door and this property was bought by Bert before they were married. They then together bought further properties in this area, including Windy Valley.' So the family has long been associated with this area and this bridge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jeff Shallcross said, 'I'm sure even the Roman road builders would be proud of this one!' I absolutely agree. He told me a great anecdote about what happened before this two-lane bridge was constructed. When it was a one-lane bridge the protocol was that, if you were coming from the town, you were given right of wayâ€”because it was a big deal to go to the town. So if you were coming from the town when it was a one-way bridge you were given right of way. That was the protocol. But Jeff did tell me that perhaps the real reason was that, if you were coming from town, maybe you'd gone to the local pub and it was wise to give way to you! That's just one of the many stories that make this country so great.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  In the wake of a year marked by bushfires and coronavirus, the impact of the climate emergency on our health has never been more critical or more in our face. The World Health Organization has declared that climate change is the greatest threat to human health this century. The Bureau of Meteorology has confirmed that, under current global pledges, Australia will experience warming effects of 3.4 to 4.4 degrees by the end of the century. This would fundamentally alter our very way of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The risks posed to our health by climate change are getting worse every year. As global temperatures rise, extreme weather events like bushfires, droughts, cyclones and floods are becoming more frequent and severe. This is putting lives, health and the wellbeing of the entire world population at risk. We are already seeing the increasing effects of air pollution and the threats to food and water supply and security. Climate change is contributing to an increased risk of infectious diseases, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, asthma, allergies, mental ill health, psychosocial impacts, violence, poor nutrition, injury, poisoning and mortality. Climate change is also worsening the conditions that led to the COVID-19 pandemic, with environmental degradation and habitat loss responsible for the increased risks of zoonotic diseases like coronavirus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the absence of action, climate change is predicted to lead to 85 deaths per 100,000 people per year globally by the end of the century, more than are currently killed by all infectious diseases across the globe. The <span style="font-style:italic;">MJA-Lancet</span> Countdown report released today highlighted that the 2019-20 bushfires resulted in about 450 deaths due to direct injury and air pollution exposure. The air pollution was so severe that it made the New South Wales annual average PM2.5 concentration the highest by far in the past 20 years. Climate change also poses the serious risk of disruption to our healthcare supply chain, damage to our health infrastructure and threats to the safety and quality of health care provided. On our current trajectory, if it continues unchecked, we face threats to humanity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we have devoted much of 2020 to solving the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change continues. We need to apply the same level of focus, intervention and concentration on climate change as we have done, rightly, on coronavirus. Australia's peak body of climate and health, the Climate and Health Alliance, recently released a policy road map for a 'healthy, regenerative and just' future. This road map has been endorsed by 29 leading health groups so far, including the Public Health Association of Australia, the Consumers Health Forum of Australia and the Australian College of Nursing. Health organisations are recognising this climate emergency. They are doing the work and, quite frankly, the government should be doing much more in this space. We need a comprehensive, nationally coordinated response to climate change, putting health at its core.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now we have the opportunity to protect our health from the devastating impacts of climate change, but we don't have any time to waste. We need to adjust our climate targets to net zero emissions by 2035 at the very latest. Otherwise, it is going to be too late and we are going to suffer these consequences. We need to end fossil fuel use for good. This includes no new coal, oil or gas. We need massive investment in renewables in this country so that we can run on 100 per cent renewable energy. It's time to apply the same level of urgency to tackling this crisis as we have done to the COVID-19 pandemic. We need to make sure that we are integrating climate across portfolio areas, and we need to make sure we are addressing climate change from a health lens as well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  As we all know, and as a number of speakers have spoken about this evening, 2020 has been an incredibly difficult and trying year for us Australians. We've contended with drought, fires, floods and now COVID-19. It's been the year of the Aussie battler, without doubt, where our strong values of hard work, perseverance and steadfastness in the face of adversity have certainly been put to the test. It's also been a year in which Australians have stepped up to the plate and given generously of their time, money and volunteer hours to help out others in their community, a year in which charitable organisations have been working tirelessly to support those in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So today I rise to speak about the Australian Red Cross, an organisation whose work at times goes largely underreported but which has a profound impact on the lives of many Australians. Not since World War II has there been so much demand for Red Cross services. Staff and volunteers have been involved in three significant, back-to-back, long-term emergenciesâ€”drought, bushfires and now COVID-19. From 1 July 2019 to 30 June this year, the Australian Red Cross emergency services activated 4,789 volunteers and staff. They helped 83,715 people across 63 eventsâ€”including the summer bushfires, drought and COVID-19â€”in one single year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The drought that has afflicted many areas around Australia has seen our farmers and regional communities face incredible adversity. But they've not faced it alone. The Red Cross and other charitable organisations have stepped up and helped out those in need. In 2019, Red Cross launched an appeal for Aussie farmers who were battling severe drought, and Australians stepped up and donated $11.5 million. A total of 7,452 grants of up to $3,000 were distributed, with the support of partners like the CWA and the Rural Financial Counselling Service. They've helped relieve financial stress for farmers and their families caused by the drought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then came the Black Summer bushfires, fires that were on a scale never seen before in Australiaâ€”tens of millions of hectares burnt, 33 lives lost, 3,000 houses burnt down and millions of animals killed or displaced. The Red Cross and other charities faced public pressure on several fronts, with public demands to get money to people quickly and claims that they were holding onto money. A key part of disaster support and recovery is getting funds to those affected as quickly as possible, but that comes with the responsibility of ensuring the funds are managed properly and the money goes where it is supposed to go. Another key aspect of disaster recovery is ensuring that there are funds remaining to support people weeks and months after the disaster. In the case of the Black Summer bushfires, since June the Red Cross has had more than 1,739 people come forward seeking financial assistance for the first time, months after the last fires were extinguished. When it comes to providing grants in a disaster, there are several phases: immediate emergency grants, rebuilding and long-term recovery. The Red Cross is one of the few emergency management organisations that operate in all three stages: in preparedness, in response and in recovery. This is why funds should not be spent all at once during an emergency. This is why the Red Cross is still able to be out there helping people in the community now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, just as many communities were starting to recover, along came COVID-19 and many Australians were plunged into economic hardship. Once again, organisations like the Red Cross came to the fore. Since April this year, federal government funding of $13 million has been provided to Red Cross under the government's $200 million Community Support Package.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I would like to thank the Australian Red Cross for everything they've done this year to support those in need. There are thousands of Australians around our great country who have a roof over their head and food on the table thanks to the work of the Red Cross. I would ask all Australians during Christmas, during this time of giving, to remember the Red Cross, to be generous and to make a donation.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  As the Morrison government continues to congratulate itself on a job well done and use slogans and advertising to try to convince Australians that they are on top of our economic recovery, the truth about our economy right now is that people are hurting and they are worried about the future. The latest wage data shows that wages grew slower in the past 12 months than ever before. It has been a tough year. But this data is off the back of years and years of stagnant wage growth under this government before the pandemic even hit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of low wage growth, we know that we have a crisis of insecure work in this country. The pandemic highlighted this crisis and it has made it worse. We've got used to insecure work; we've almost come to accept it. The workers that we needed to get us through the pandemic were employed in some of the worst examples of insecure work that we have seen, and that has impacted our health response. We've heard on many occasions of aged-care workers and security guards who had to have a second job because their first job was too insecure and didn't provide the security of a full-time job that they needed. It has also impacted our economic response, because it will take longer for our economy to recover if more jobs are insecure. The government chose to exclude casual workers from JobKeeper, yet so many of the workers who were directly impacted by the shutdowns needed to get us through this pandemic were in highly casualised workforces. People in the arts and entertainment sector, hospitality workers, retail workersâ€”all of these workers were already in casual and insecure work, and yet the government chose to exclude casual workers from the JobKeeper scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economy cannot recover if Australians don't have good, secure jobs. Maybe some of those opposite don't understand what it's like to have a casual, insecure job. I can tell you that not knowing when your next shift is going to be impacts your entire life. Inversely, we know that a good, secure job gives you the confidence to spend money in your local businesses, in local shops, in your community. It gives you the confidence to pay for extra health appointments, to get check-ups that you might need, to plan for the future, to save for a house, to make sure that you've got a good, dignified retirement. You can't do those things if you don't know when your next shift is coming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers around the country this Christmas won't be having a very good Christmas. They are not out there high-fiving each other about this government's so-called comeback. It won't be a great Christmas this year for workers in the mining industry, who are facing the prospect of becoming permanent casuals. We know that casualisation has been rife in the mining industry for years. This government have stood up and said they would do something about it. They don't say it here while they're standing in the chamber, but they say it when they're standing on the ground in central Queenslandâ€”the member for Dawson and Senator Canavan often tell people from the mining industry that they will do something to fix casualisation. But, when given the chance to do something about this, the government are instead intervening in a High Court case that would overturn a decision that stops mining companies from making workers permanent casuals. That is what the government are doing. And we need to judge the government on their actions, not on what they say when they're standing in central Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It won't be a great Christmas for workers who work for BHP under their operations services enterprise agreement. They have had a win: they had the EBA overturned, and thank goodness, because this was a shoddy agreement to start with. It was agreed with a couple of people in Western Australia. Nine people decided what sort of EBA would apply to thousands of workers in central Queensland. But this government has done nothingâ€”nothingâ€”to step in and stop that sort of thing from happening, to stop casualisation in the industry or to make sure that people have more secure work in these industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It won't be a very good Christmas this year for workers in the meat- and food-processing industry. They have been hit incredibly hard by this pandemic. I had the chance to meet many of them in Brisbane last week, and I thank the AMIEU for giving me the opportunity to listen directly to those workers and to understand what they're going through in their workplaces. Most recently JBS Dinmore announced that 600 Australian workers had lost their jobs. That is 600 workers who won't have a job this Christmas. And, when the government had the chance to extend JobKeeper to industries like the meatworkers industry and to businesses like JBS, they didn't take that chance. Josh Frydenberg refused to sign. Those jobs could have been saved if this government had stepped in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Qantas workers will not be having a very good Christmas this year, because this week we found out that 2,000 ground crew jobs will be outsourced. That includes 50 jobs in Cairns, in regional Queensland, where I live. Outsourcing doesn't mean that the work doesn't need to be done. We know that now. It doesn't mean that the job doesn't need to be done. It just means that Qantas are saying that they would prefer for that work to be done by someone who has a less secure job. This government have turned their backs on aviation workers. They've had plenty of subsidies and grants, and even JobKeeper, paid to Qantas. The business has said that it will be back in the black next year. But these workers won't have a job. They'll have to bid for their jobs, and they're having to compete for jobs with people on labour hire contracts in casual employmentâ€”insecure work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to learn the lessons that this pandemic has taught us, and one of the things the pandemic has shown us is that insecure work is damaging to the economy and it's damaging to the community. It's shown us that we need to make sure that people have secure jobs, because it's good for our economy. All we have got from this government, from its leadership right down to its backbench, is more attacks on working people and more pushes to make sure that people have less secure work. Next week, the government will be bringing IR legislation out publicly for the first time. We hear a lot from this government about everyone playing their part in the so-called 'Team Australia' recovery. They will probably say things along the lines of, 'What our economy and labour market need is more flexibility.' But can I tell you, Mr President, that flexibility is often a vehicle for increasing insecurity. It is a word that is used instead of 'insecurity'. When the government say 'flexibility', what they mean is insecurity. I was shocked todayâ€”shockedâ€”to hear Senator Stoker, a Queenslander, actually blame Qantas workers for not accepting more flexible working conditions and for this leading to their own redundancies. She blamed them for their own redundancies because they had not accepted more flexible working conditions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time the government says flexible, what they mean is insecure. Insecure work is bad for workers, bad for families and bad for our economy. We'll have an opportunity, at the end of this pandemic, to make sure that more people are in secure jobs. But this government have shown during this pandemic that they are not willing to stand up for workers or to do the hard work to make sure people have good working conditions and good, secure jobs. That is very concerning, because it means that our economy and our recovery will take longer under this government, and it means that people will not have the jobs that they need this Christmas to feel secure, to take care of their families and to plan for the future.</span>
