                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  Families need certainty about their access to paid parental leave during these challenging times. We all need leadership from this government so that anxious families have some peace of mind when looking to the future. Treasurer Frydenberg infamously said in July that people should have more babies to stimulate the economy. But with the government taking so long to implement a change as simple as this, it provides no consolation to prospective families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Coronavirus and Other Measures) Bill 2020 also improves assistance for families affected by stillbirth and infant death in respect of payments for newborn children. The bill does this by increasing the maximum amount that eligible families can access after a stillbirth or a child's death up to the child's first birthday. This is a welcome amendment and will come as a relief to many families who are going through this traumatic event. Losing a child is a devastating and heartbreaking experience, and we commend the government for finally enacting these important provisions. Again, this is something Labor has advocated for a very long time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, this bill will allow the minister to determine the average weekly earnings trend figures ordinarily published by the Australian Statistician for child support assessment purposes. This will be under the circumstances where the publication of trend estimates for the average weekly earnings series has been suspended due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are welcome, but they do not go far enough to ensure that Australians who continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic are not left behind. During the last sitting period, Labor moved amendments in the House to (1) extend the $250 per fortnight coronavirus supplement until March. Currently, it is scheduled to end at Christmas, but obviously there was an announcement yesterday. Christmas is rapidly approaching us and people relying on this supplement need certainty. It will help 2.2 million Australians who will face the cruel Christmas cut and bring the payment in line with JobKeeper. The government has determined that these people need additional support. Why not those on JobSeeker? That's the question. And (2) it requires the government to provide more support to pensioners who have faced increased costs during the pandemic, such as the cost of face masks, hand sanitiser, doctors appointments and the traditional costs of trying to keep safe. Three, Labor also moved to call on the government to announce a permanent increase to the base rate of JobSeeker again. Not only has Labor been calling for this for some time but also economists, the crossbench and industry specialists have all said that there needs to be a permanent increase to the rate of JobSeeker, or, as it was previously called, Newstart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now it is more important than ever—1.8 million people are set to be unemployed. They need this support and they need it now. Numbers are still predicted to be above pre-recession levels until 2024. By increasing the rate of JobSeeker, it will have a beneficial effect on employment, health and economic growth. People shouldn't have to fall into poverty because they've lost their jobs, but reducing JobSeeker back to $40 a day will do just that. Put simply, it's not enough to cover the basic costs of housing, food, public transport and bills. How can people rebuild their lives if they can't do these basic things?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To no real surprise, the government voted against these amendments, as they have distorted views of people who live on welfare payments. The Morrison government need to give people who have lost their jobs certainty beyond Christmas. They can do this by extending the coronavirus supplement and announcing a permanent increase to the JobSeeker payment. I think that we can all agree that this year has clearly demonstrated that living on $40 a day is not sustainable or suitable for having a decent quality of life in this country. An important part of our economic recovery will be to promote consumption, but now Australians on social security will have less to spend on local and small businesses, and these businesses will have less to spend on wages and jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With currently around 106 jobseekers for every job, how can government start to rip away support from these people when the government can't even provide enough jobs for them to apply for? This recession was induced as a result of government mandated lockdowns to protect us from the health consequences of this virus spreading to an uncontrollable point. It is only fair that the government continues providing support until the economy and the unemployment rate shows true signs of recovering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor support the changes announced by the government as they are measures which we have been advocating for from the outset of this pandemic, but, with Christmas just around the corner, the Morrison government will deliver a cut to thousands and thousands of families. In these uncertain times, we don't want a marketing manager; what we want, what this country needs is a leader. Those sitting across the aisle know that a permanent increase in the rate of JobSeeker is the right thing to do. But what we hear from them is deafening silence on this issue as they are unwilling to embrace the true spirit of Australia and ensure no-one gets left behind. As a nation, we look out for one another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister is in the chamber at the moment. She has the opportunity to leave a lasting legacy, which she has acknowledged and understands. She has been listening to the thousands of families who find themselves in hardship, who find themselves unemployed. And there are many thousands of people who never expected to be unemployed and having to try and survive, because they can't live on the JobSeeker payment. They can't live on it. All they're trying to do is survive from one day to the next. So this is an opportunity for the minister to be a leader in her government by making a permanent change and speaking up for those people who don't have a voice in the government. I know the Prime Minister doesn't like to hear the minister speak too much, which we saw evidence of in the media, but the reality is, when you're a cabinet minister, when you have this responsibility, you owe it to those who don't have a voice to be a strong voice within your government. We on this side of the chamber are strong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People on the crossbench have for a long time, along with Labor, been advocating for a permanent change to restore dignity to those people who find themselves unemployed. On many, many levels, they feel the effects of poverty and self-loathing because they're not able to support their family. For those who have never experienced that, I can tell you: that's a lived experience that will stay with you your entire life, because it makes you appreciate everything that you have. And when you are able to climb out of poverty, able to be re-employed and able to carve out a career for yourself, I can tell you firsthand: you never ever forget those experiences. When you have to say no to your children—that they can't do that school excursion or that they can't have a new dress to go to a birthday party—those experiences stay with you well beyond your time being supported by social security, which is there in this great country of ours to support people and to give them a helping hand while they find their way back into employment. So I implore the minister to stand up for those people and to leave a lasting legacy as a cabinet minister to turn this government's mind to being more supportive, to being more caring and to giving those people a helping hand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's easy to say that the best form of help and social security is a job. The reality is that there are more than 30 people for every job that's advertised in Tasmania, my home state. So stating that a job is the best form of social security is an easy statement to make, but it's a hollow statement if you don't lead from the front and demonstrate that you have heard, you have listened and you are going to act to help restore the dignity and the opportunity for those people who find themselves out of work. So, Minister, we on this side are looking to you, because it's quite obvious that the Prime Minister is only ever interested in photo opportunities and headlines, because he never follows through and he doesn't listen to those people who are doing it tough in this country. We as senators have a responsibility to do everything we can.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:42</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I advise that One Nation supports age pensioners, and we believe the current pension rate is too low. Our policy is for an increase in the age pension of $75 a week. The Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Coronavirus and Other Measures) Bill 2020 does not increase the base rate of the pension but rather gives two payments of $250. This is a little sugar hit that will achieve very little for the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our pensioners are trying to support themselves in a very low interest rate environment. Pensioners who have saved all their lives are finding it impossible to live off the income from their savings, because there is no income with interest rates at almost zero. A permanent increase in pensions is the only way to give pensioners a fair income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, the Senate passed the glossy JobMaker scheme. JobMaker is nothing but corporate welfare, with payments expected to go to the government's big corporate mates. Pensioners are clearly not the government's mates. Think about electricity prices that have been driven up by Labor, Liberal, Nationals and Greens policies—doubled or, in some cases, tripled in the last 20 years. That's a highly regressive tax on the poor. How can people afford that, especially pensioners who are receiving little income? Premier Palaszczuk in Queensland, the Premier in absence, is stealing $1.4 billion a year off electricity users in Queensland. Costs are going up but pensions are not. Australia has one of the lowest pensions in the Western world. It's time to increase pensions to restore dignity to pensioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of a pension increase to the government is very small. Pensioners are on such a low income that any increase to the pension is immediately felt and immediately spent. This is why the government has selected pensioners for this sugar hit. Treasury knows the money will be spent in the local economy, where that money will grow the local economy and grow employment, creating jobs. That money then comes back to the government in tax revenue: GST, income tax, duties in alcohol and tobacco and so on. It's a shame that glossy JobMaker payments will not work like that. JobMaker payments go to the company, not the worker. That money will increase corporate profits and from there go overseas to overseas shareholders through dividends. JobMaker, notwithstanding its glossy brochure, with lots of colourful diagrams and photos and snazzy headlines, will have little expansionary benefit because the money is in the wrong hands. Pensioners should not be underpaid so big corporates can be overpaid. I do note that the government has made this payment conditional on the pensioner being a resident in Australia—at last. I hope this new-found concern for Australian taxpayers can be extended to every other application of government policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of the bill supports young people whose path towards demonstrating independence through work has been disrupted by the economic impacts of the COVID virus. For the youth allowance, the six month period between 25 March 2020 and 24 September 2020 will automatically now be recognised as contributing to existing workforce independence criteria. That's welcome. Without this change, many young people may not be able to meet the independence criteria and may be unable to access income support if they plan to go onto tertiary study. With this change, as many as 4,000 students will be able to maintain their plan to go to university in 2021. I have previously pointed out that the Morrison government inflates the numbers it uses in these measures to make for a better announcement. I'm sure that this will be the case here. Announcements are not achievements. Announcements are for marketers; achievements are for honest governments and come from honest governance. Announcements are not governance. Nonetheless, One Nation support this measure as well because we support students being able to co-pay their way through university to gain the education they need to better their lives. At the moment, a relaxation of the rules for student payments is a very useful measure. With the level of debt imposed on Australians by the Morrison government now budgeted to exceed $1 trillion, young Australians will need all the help they can get for the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill will make amendments to create temporary incentives in the income support system to encourage young Australians to undertake seasonal agricultural work. We welcome this. The amendment means that a person who earns at least $15,000 through employment in the agricultural industry between 30 November this year and 31 December next year, 2021, will be considered as independent for the purposes of student allowance and Abstudy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's about time the government realised we have a farmworker shortage. As Senator Hanson and I have travelled across Queensland in the last few months, we've heard from many businesses—many widely different businesses—who could not bring in the crop or run their business because there were no workers. I spoke with Jackie, for example, a florist in Rockhampton who has run a business for many years. She told me that her business and other small businesses in Rocky couldn't find workers. They now have young teenagers working there. The local waste company couldn't fill their rosters, so they couldn't turn their skips around fast enough to make a profit. That's thanks to the cowardly actions of Premier Palaszczuk, a premier in absence. Queensland farmers are ploughing millions of dollars of produce into the ground because workers won't—or can't, thanks to the Premier—go to the farms. This measure will, we hope, encourage 4,000 young Australians to go bush, where they will find the work rewarding, the pay generous and the lifestyle superb. The regional communities are very enriching. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government is to keep the borders closed to backpackers then more measures such as this are urgently required. It's not good enough that able-bodied Australians are languishing on JobSeeker, for years on end, when rewarding jobs are available in some of the best communities in Australia. It may take a push to encourage the unemployed to break patterns of behaviour that are failing them and embrace the move to the country. Now would be a really good time to do that. One Nation calls on the Morrison government to make schedule 3 the start of a new era of matching jobseekers to those seeking workers in rural areas. Matching employers and employees—wouldn't that be wonderful! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of the bill introduces a revised paid parental leave work test. There will be $130 million spent to provide access to paid parental leave pay, and dad and partner pay, to applicants who do not meet the current work test provisions because their employment has been affected by the government's response to the COVID virus. This measure, we're told, will allow 9,000 Australians to retain their eligibility for parental leave pay and is expected to increase claimants of the dad and partner benefit by $3,500. Once again, government figures provided to spruik these measures are likely shonky; yet this measure will allow dads to give their newborns a better start. We welcome that because, for far too many years, some dads were a pocketbook and nothing more. The modern trend of encouraging dads to share in the birth and the upbringing of their children is most welcome. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The remaining measures in this bill are commonsense measures to simplify bereavement benefits and provide an alternative benchmarking system for child support payments during the COVID era only. One Nation will be supporting this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:49</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Coronavirus and Other Measures) Bill 2020. When the government does something good we're very happy to welcome it, and there are many good features in this bill. I'll highlight just a couple of those today. Then I'm going to talk about a huge missed opportunity this government had to address the need for a permanent and decent rate of JobSeeker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I welcome the government's 180-degree backflip on eligibility for paid parental leave. People might recall that just a few months ago the Greens moved amendments to the effect of ensuring that people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own, because of the pandemic, could still get the paid parental leave they had been banking on receiving as folk about to become new parents or adding to their families. This government voted against that amendment, as did the folk in the One Nation party, but today we see in schedule 4 of the bill that this very same amendment is there. We welcome the government seeing reason and standing by people who are about to add to their families. I don't know why it was so difficult to do that two months ago—perhaps it was because it had 'Greens' on the header—but we're pleased to see that our original advocacy for this has ended up in a government bill that, naturally, One Nation is now supporting. I'm very keen to put on the record that our original good idea has now been adopted. We welcome that because raising a family isn't cheap, and people do bank on things like paid parental leave when they're doing their finances for an upcoming addition to their family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the pandemic hit the unexpected hit, and many people either had their hours reduced or lost their jobs completely and were not eligible, in many instances, sadly, for JobKeeper, which meant they were ineligible for paid parental leave. We tried to fix the eligibility for JobKeeper as well, at the time, but the government was resolute in denying short-term casuals, in denying people on particular visas and in denying people who work at universities the support that we and many Australians believe they should have received. Nonetheless, there's a backflip here, that we welcome, in extending the eligibility for paid parental leave for people who have lost their jobs due to coronavirus and, therefore, would not otherwise be eligible for PPL. We very much welcome schedule 4.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 talks about stillbirth, and it's a very important topic for many people. The Select Committee on Stillbirth Research and Education did identify the need for more support to be provided to bereaved parents and their families, with more than 2,000 children stillborn each year. The current laws make a really inexplicable and unfair distinction in eligibility for stillborn baby payments. Parents who experience the loss of their first stillborn baby are entitled to a payment, but parents experiencing a second or subsequent stillbirth only get half that payment. But the expenses don't reduce, so there is actually no justification for that reduction in payment. The support payments are designed to relieve the financial pressure, but, as I've said, those expenses don't actually reduce and the grief and the stress are probably vastly increased once this has happened a second or third time around. So, in fact, the need for support is perfectly ample. We welcome the fact that the government has belatedly addressed this. It has been an inequity for many a year and we welcome, finally, some justice being delivered there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To come to the parts of this bill that, sadly, could have been fixed by this government were they so minded but weren't, we saw this week the government finally announce that JobSeeker would be continued for a few months but at an even lower rate again. They have already cut it once and now they have cut it a second time. Come 1 January, the coronavirus supplement for people on JobSeeker is going to be only $150. That is not enough. That is still below the poverty line. Did the government learn nothing? Did the government not see the joy and the basic needs being able to be met by so many families around this country when they had an adequate amount of income support? As my colleague Senator Siewert has said for many a year, $40 a day was never enough to live on. It's the children that suffer. It's those choices between textbooks and dinner that no Australian, no-one anywhere, should have to make.</span>

What we saw earlier in the week was the Prime Minister making a belated and patched-up announcement of another reduction to JobSeeker support. What I would really like to see, what the Greens would really like to see, would be this Prime Minister actually focusing on job creation, rather than passing the buck to the private sector. We so frequently hear the Prime Minister say that it's not up to him to create jobs. Well, dude, you are the Prime Minister. You've got the public purse strings at your disposal.

                    </a>  Prime Minister, you have the Commonwealth purse at your disposal. Use it wisely to invest in job-creating infrastructure. Schools, hospitals, manufacturing clean energy components—these are things that address issues but also create jobs. It just really irks us when the government try to claim that job creation is something that they can't do, that—gee!—they would love to but they're not able to. What an absolute crock. Instead of the $99 billion in corporate welfare that this budget represented, they should have invested in public services that create jobs and deliver the services that Australians deserve and rely upon. Rebuild our domestic manufacturing base, have top-quality public schools and hospitals, invest in 100 per cent clean energy, build some public housing so that we don't have a problem with homelessness and that people have somewhere to go—these are the job-creating initiatives and investments that could have been made by the Prime Minister. But, instead, the government chose the $99 billion to go to their big corporate mates through various different handouts and subsidies, often with no strings attached. There's still a refusal to increase JobSeeker to a rate that will allow people to live and have the ability to seek work, should work become available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We welcome the parts of the bill that address some of those inequities. We welcome the adoption of the Greens' view that paid parental leave should have always been available to people who lost their job because of the pandemic. We welcome the fixing of the inequity in the stillborn birth payments. But we remain completely broken-hearted at this government's continued failure to see how desperate so many Australian families are and how much good it has done for those families to be able to put food on the table, to replace that broken toaster, to put petrol in the car or to buy a second-hand suit jacket to go to a job interview. These are the things that make a difference in peoples' lives. For the government to both wash its hands of job creation and still refuse to provide adequate support for jobseekers to live on is just an absolute abrogation of duty.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KENEALLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:59</span>):  I rise to make a short contribution on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Coronavirus and Other Measures) Bill 2020. I acknowledge that my colleague Senator Dodson has responded comprehensively to the legislation, as has my colleague Senator Polley. I associate myself with and endorse their remarks. I would like to speak specifically to one aspect of the bill, and that is the changes that the bill introduces in relation to the stillborn baby payment and the bereavement payment. In doing so I rise as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Stillbirth Research and Education. I acknowledge my fellow members of that committee on a bipartisan basis and acknowledge the bipartisan report that was delivered to this chamber. It was the first set of national recommendations in terms of preventing and reducing stillbirth in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures that are in this legislation were actually not part of the Senate select committee specifically, but arose after the committee delivered its report. I'd like to acknowledge Senator Catryna Bilyk, who participated in the inquiry, for bringing this matter first to my attention and then to the attention of Labor's shadow minister for health, Chris Bowen. With the support of the Labor opposition, we discussed the matter with the minister and Senator Ruston.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge Senator Ruston for her reception, interest and support for ensuring that parents of stillborn babies are treated as parents—that is, if parents have a stillborn baby, they are still parents. A mother still gives birth; she goes through labour and delivery. The mother and the baby's father still have responsibilities as parents towards that child. The mother and the father both need to grieve and receive counselling and support. The mother needs to recover physically from the birth. I think for a very long time—and I apportion no blame in making this statement—many people have not understood that parents of stillborn babies are actually parents and they go through birth, delivery and recovery from the birth and they need to make decisions regarding things like autopsies, cremations and burials. There's a financial impact on a family. Sometimes there is a loss of hours at work or loss of a job. In the Senate select committee we heard terrible stories of people who were simply unable to work for very long periods of time. One family told us the story of how they lost their business because they could not continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet we had a support system across decades, with governments of both stripes, that treated parents of stillborn babies not as parents or not equally as parents. The changes that the minister is introducing here today in relation to the stillborn baby payment and the bereavement payment ensure that parents of stillborn babies are treated in the same way and supported in the same way as parents of babies whose child has died perhaps one moment or just moments after birth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge that the legislation makes a change to supporting parents who have more than one stillborn baby to ensure that they receive equal support. Again the Senate select committee heard very sad stories. One couple who came before us, Bonnie and Stephen Carter, lost both of their daughters, Grace and Matilda. Bonnie has been a tremendous advocate for ensuring that parents of stillborn babies receive support and that Australia does what it can do to prevent this tragedy from happening again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the minister and acknowledge her support for this legislation. I'd like to thank senators, including Senator Waters, who spoke just now in support of the measures that are within this bill. I look forward to what I hope will be its passage through this parliament.</span>

The Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Coronavirus and Other Measures) Bill 2020 includes a number of beneficial measures that are primarily directed at supporting people who've been impacted by the economic consequences of COVID-19. The bill provides additional assistance through two further economic support payments of $250 to around five million payment recipients and cardholders in the lead-up to Christmas and in the New Year as part of the Australian government's response to the pandemic.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 January 2021, amendments are also made so that the six-month period between 25 March and 24 September 2020 will automatically be recognised as contributing to the existing workforce independence criteria for people on youth allowance. This measure supports young people whose path towards demonstrating independence through work has been disrupted by the economic impacts of COVID. The same concessions will be available to Abstudy recipients through the Abstudy Policy Manual. The bill also creates temporary incentives in the income support system to encourage young Australians to undertake seasonal agriculture work to help address concerns across the agriculture sector about immediate workforce availability for the upcoming harvest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 March 2021, the new criteria will recognise a person who earns at least $15,000 through employment in agricultural industries between 30 November 2020 and 31 December 2021 as independent for the purposes of youth allowance student, subject to a parental income threshold. The same concessions will be available for Abstudy through changes to the Abstudy Policy Manual.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also introduce a revised paid parental leave work test period for a limited time to enable people to access paid parental leave and dad and partner pay who do not meet the current work test provisions because their employment has been affected by COVID-19. This will enable most individuals with a genuine work history prior to the pandemic to qualify for payments under the paid parental leave scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also makes amendments to address inconsistencies in payments for newborn children available to families affected by stillbirth and infant death by aligning the amounts that eligible families are able to access after a stillbirth or child's death shortly after birth, up to the child's first birthday. These amendments also remove discrepancies within the payment system in respect of multiple instances of stillbirth or infant death with the same family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, the bill makes technical amendments to child support law to allow for alternative figures to be used in place of the male total average weekly earnings trend figure and average weekly earnings trend figure for the purposes of child support assessment calculations. From May 2020, the Bureau of Statistics has temporarily suspended publication of trend estimates for all average weekly earnings series due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market. Child support law does not currently prevent alternative trend measures to be used. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

A lot of these people you're trying to encourage out of the cities to take up this work won't have had any rural experience, so they might need a bit of extra support to facilitate their involvement in taking up this work. We're looking at people who haven't had this experience before; I presume they're the young people we're trying to target through this particular initiative.</span>

I have to say, coming from a rural and regional area and having employed very many young people, it's not necessarily around all the support services they might need; you might find that they need a whole heap fewer support services in moving to rural and regional areas, because of the community spirit that exists in country areas. From a physical support perspective, the $6,000 relocation allowance would be accessible to these young people if they chose to move over a longer term, if they decided they were going to move to a region for a year or so to take up this work—not that the $6,000 is constrained by having to work in an area for a year. All the usual workforce and workplace measures in support of the rights and the occupational health and safety of workers exist. As I say, the supports that are provided in many rural and regional areas are exemplary.</span>

But you have to admit there are a lot of young people who have also been exploited through this process, and I'm keen to ensure that that remains foremost in people's minds in supporting these young people to ensure that nobody is exploited. As I said in my second reading contribution, I realise that most employers in the bush and most farmers and horticulturalists are good employers. But I want to ensure that everybody has a good experience when they take up this particular opportunity.</span>

They could be minimum employment conditions, access to superannuation, workers compensation or workplace safety. They apply to everybody. If there were a situation where somebody believed that their employer wasn't meeting their legal obligations, the Fair Work Ombudsman would be an appropriate place for those matters to be taken up. I want to assure you that all of the provisions and protections that are in place for workers exist under this program.</span>

However, we will be providing information to the people who have become eligible retrospectively and would be seeking to work with them to ensure that any opportunity to mitigate them incurring a debt because they are now able to access Paid Parental Leave will be a very fundamental part of the negotiations with those people as we identify them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has today moved amendments to ensure greater support for those Australians who have been left behind by this government in its economic response to the recession. It's very disappointing that the government voted against similar amendments in the House, and we sincerely hope the government has reconsidered. These amendments are reasonable and responsible, they are modest and they provide the government the flexibility it needs to deliver the appropriate support for Australians during the recession and into the future. Everyone in the parliament knows that the only way there can be support for all Australians that need it, including a permanent increase in the rate of JobSeeker, is if the government supports it. The government has the numbers in the House and it can do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have structured these amendments in a way that gives the government the flexibility they need to deliver because we don't just want to make a point; we want to see change. The Prime Minister says, 'We're all in this together,' but our pensioners and carers have been left behind. He says, 'We're all in this together,' but 1.8 million Australians on unemployment support have been left uncertain as to what kind of support will be available to them beyond Christmas. If we're all in this together, why are almost one million Australians on unemployment support excluded from the hiring subsidy? If we're all in this together, the government should put their money where their rhetoric is and support this amendment moved by Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During these difficult and uncertain times, pensioners and carers have experienced increased costs in ensuring they remain safe and healthy. Unlike the government, Labor acknowledge that older Australians, people with disabilities and carers have experienced increased costs as a result of the coronavirus. In June, we saw the release of a survey from People with Disability Australia which found that nine in 10 people with disabilities have experienced increased expenses due to the ongoing pandemic and 31 per cent have reported increased spending on health care. Pensioners have been facing rising health, dental, energy and grocery bills for years. Average GP out-of-pocket costs alone have gone up by $10 under this government. Labor's amendment will create an obligation on the minister to better support pensions, including the age pension, the disability support pension and carer payment receipts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's announcement today that it will cut the coronavirus supplement by $100 a fortnight from Christmas is a huge disappointment. It is uncaring and cruel and will see people face hardship, poverty and, no doubt, mental stress. It's also bad for the economy, withdrawing support right at the time it matters most for local business and jobs. That's because people on low incomes and those on social security payments have such a high propensity to spend. They spend in local shops and local businesses right around Australia. Over 2. 2 million Australians will see their payments cut at Christmas because of this decision. At a time when the unemployment crisis is getting worse, not better, we can only assume that the rate will go all the way back to the $40 a day for many people from March, a rate that is simply too low to live on. The impact of this uncertainty is being strung along. It's terrible for people's mental health and their confidence. It doesn't create any jobs whatsoever. That is what this government should be focused on now. It should be focused on creating jobs and making sure people have enough to live with dignity. Instead the government's plan is yet again another cut to those out of work long before the crisis is over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What people need is support, reassurance and certainty. Cutting the supplement a second time from $250 to $150 will leave many families at Christmas time trying to decide where to make savings in the household budget. They've already become very tight and very strict. It is a time when Australians will simply want to be able to spend quality time with loved ones after what has been such a tough year for so many.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's amendments will extend the coronavirus supplement at the current rate of $250 until the end of March, in line with JobKeeper. More than that, we call on the government to deliver a permanent increase to the JobSeeker payment, which is something Labor has consistently advocated for and is something that many on the other side also have been advocating for. The member for Cowper recently declared that returning the rate to $40 a days would be 'fairly cruel and unusual punishment'. We know the government used their numbers to defeat this amendment in the House, but we sincerely hope that they have used the intervening time to reflect on what this means for those Australians who have the least and have lost the most. In a country like Australia, poverty is not inevitable; it is a policy choice. It's time for the government to do the right thing and support this amendment.</span>

We would like to see the coronavirus supplement extended. Of course, I have a bill in this place that would extend the original supplement, but the $250 per fortnight is the least we can do. Although we've been advocating since the beginning of the crisis that people on disability support pension, people on carer payment and age pensioners who are on CRA should also get the coronavirus supplement, paragraph (b) of this amendment, indicating better support for recipients goes some way to meeting the needs of people on DSP, the age pension and carer payment, who we all know are paying more costs in the face of the pandemic and need additional support. We will be supporting these amendments.</span>

I would like to reinforce in this place that the government is extending the temporary measure that is the coronavirus supplement from 1 January to 31 March. That is an announcement that was made yesterday. We're also extending a number of other measures that expand the criteria for eligibility for access to working age payment so as to include people who are self employed, people who are sole traders, people who've been stood down but remain engaged with their workplace, people who are isolating and people who are caring for people who are isolating. We're also continuing to waive a number of the waiting periods and to maintain the partner taper rate at an elevated level to ensure that even more Australians, who otherwise would not be able to get access to these payments, will be able to.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The suggestion that we are cutting anything is absolutely not correct. We will be making available to Australians $3.2 billion in the first three months of 2021 in support of the extension of measures. This government will be standing side by side with Australians who are doing it tough as they transition back to work. I absolutely reject the claim that we are cutting anything. A $3.2 billion additional spend in the first three months cannot be described in any way other than as an additional increase in payment. It is not a cut.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment the opposition has put forward, which we are talking to at the moment, is not associated in any way with the measures contained in this bill. This bill delivers on a series of budget measures, in the Social Services portfolio, that provide additional support to a broad range of Australians but not in relation to the measure that the opposition is referring to in their amendment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides two additional economic support payments to over five million pensioners, income support recipients and healthcare cardholders. It expands youth allowance through the new workforce participation criteria, provides concessional access through the paid parental scheme changes for people impacted by the pandemic and addresses inequities in the stillbirth payments and associated payments. The proposed amendment does not address any of these measures, whatsoever, and I would suggest it is nothing more than a political statement around unrelated elements of the portfolio. The government announced on 10 November 2020 that the coronavirus supplement would be extended at a cost of $3.2 billion. The legislation that will give effect to that measure will be subject to the introduction of a separate bill later this week. That legislation would be a far more appropriate place to raise this issue, if that's what you wish to do. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is very strongly supporting pensioners. We supported age pensioners, disability pensioners and carers as well as other recipients of family tax benefit and healthcare cardholders with two $750 economic support payments, which were provided to pensioners in April and July, and we have announced that a further two support payments will be made in the lead-up to Christmas and another one in early 2021. In respect of permanent settings for income support, the government has been very clear about making sure that we remain focused on supporting Australians, through these unprecedented circumstances, with this temporary targeted and comprehensive range of supports that are available to Australians who are doing it tough as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  Labor supports the Biosecurity Amendment (Traveller Declarations and Other Measures) Bill 2020. Technically, the bill will amend the Biosecurity Act to allow the Biosecurity Regulation 2016 to specify different penalty amounts for infringement notices issued for different kinds of alleged contraventions of provisions of the Biosecurity Act. It also clarified that the regulations may prescribe different periods of time to pay an infringement notice depending on the kind or class of goods to which an alleged contravention of the Biosecurity Act relates. The bill will further amend the Biosecurity Act to permit the Director of Biosecurity to make a legislative instrument to specify goods or classes of goods that can attract a higher infringement notice amount. It will provide that the legislative instrument made by the Director of Biosecurity is not subject to parliamentary disallowance due to the technical and scientific nature of underlying risk assessments and is made for a period not longer than 12 months. It will permit the regulations to incorporate references to the legislative instrument as in force from time to time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Strengthening Australia's biosecurity system is a good thing. Our biosecurity system is described as a significant national asset. Australia has a unique environment. We are an island country, which has its benefits and challenges. We can control who comes into our country and assess incoming passengers to ensure that they are not bringing in products which pose a risk to our biosecurity status and could potentially expose our farmers and the natural environment to pests and diseases. However, this is a risk based assessment, and therefore there is a responsibility on incoming passengers to declare what they are bringing into our country, and our biosecurity officers will then determine whether the produce is a threat to Australia and Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation reminds us all that at times many Australians and, indeed, visitors to our country don't understand the importance of our biosecurity system. Everyone in this chamber will be familiar with the program <span style="font-style:italic;">Border Security: Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s Front Line</span>, where we see many visitors and Australians trying to circumvent Australia's biosecurity rules, sometimes intentionally, sometimes unknowingly. Whilst the program is called 'Border Security', it is predominantly biosecurity officers from the department of agriculture who work in partnership with their state and territory counterparts who do much of the work at our airports and ports. Biosecurity is a key responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, and ensuring that biosecurity is well understood is an important responsibility of the minister and his department. Indeed, the explanatory memorandum states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Prior to commencement of the amendments, the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment will also conduct an education and awareness campaign targeting incoming passengers and crew …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID-19 has heightened awareness of Australia's biosecurity system because of the failings at our borders to stop cruise ship passengers infected with COVID-19 from disembarking and spreading the virus throughout Australia. This failing also highlighted that there is a lack of clear understanding as to who is responsible for assessing the passengers from a biosecurity health perspective. The department of agriculture claims in its corporate plan that their biosecurity staff work on behalf of the Department of Health to carry out health screening of international passengers, yet we know that as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span> passengers left the ship no-one was assessed by biosecurity officers. There has been buck passing by the ministers as to exactly who was responsible for the health assessment of passengers on cruise ships. The Morrison government must do better at ensuring that our biosecurity system works so that Australians can have confidence that the system is robust and that the Department of Agriculture is working closely with its partners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week the CSIRO released its report into Australia's biosecurity system entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s Biosecurity Future: Unlocking the next decade of resilience</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> (2020-2030)</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span> The report paints a concerning picture of the state of our biosecurity system—that without proper resourcing our biosecurity will not be able to cope with the increase in biosecurity risks. The executive summary states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Biosecurity is critical to supporting the health of Australians, their environment and the competitiveness of key industries through biosecure trade networks. While Australia has one of the strongest biosecurity systems globally, outbreaks across human, agriculture, environment and marine health are continuing to rise in volume and complexity. This is due to a range of factors including growing levels of trade and travel, urbanisation, climate change and biodiversity loss.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report reminds us all of the economic impacts that failures in our biosecurity system will cost Australians, our natural environment and our agriculture industries. This would include $5 billion each year if a large multistate foot-and-mouth disease outbreak occurred, until it was eradicated. The report also states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Weeds cost Australia around $5 billion annually in control measures and lost production. Approximately 20 new weed species establish in Australia every year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It says the most significant mistake will be 'continuing along the "business as usual" trajectory of slow and incremental change', which 'could expose Australia to significant triple bottom line risks over the next 10 years'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past seven years of this Liberal-National coalition government, collaboration and genuine policy work to strengthen Australia's biosecurity have been haphazard and reactionary rather than forward-looking and one step ahead of potential challenges. Let's go back to one of the first acts of the Liberal-National government in 2013, which was to scrap the Standing Council on Primary Industries. Back then, the member for New England, who was the Minister for Agriculture, claimed scrapping SCoPI, as was its acronym, was a money-saving exercise. However, the cost of biosecurity failings which have occurred on their watch due to the chaos and confusion in the system far outweighs any so-called cost savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">SCoPI was a COAG committee of agriculture ministers at the federal and state levels. It was through this committee that the Intergovernmental Agreement on Biosecurity was developed. The intergovernmental agreement makes it clear that biosecurity needs to be a whole-of-government approach covering areas including trade, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, tourism, the environment, social amenity and human health. We saw in 2016-17 the devastating impact that biosecurity failings can have on farmers, with prawn farmers having to shut their farms overnight due to a white spot disease outbreak in Queensland. It cost the industry close to $100 million in losses—and, boy oh boy, don't I know, because it was our committee that went up there and actually met with the farmers. These biosecurity failings could have been avoided if the Liberal-National government properly understood the important role our biosecurity systems play in keeping farms operating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The IGAB prescribed a five-year review into biosecurity, which was undertaken by Dr Wendy Craik. The final report was delivered to the government in 2017. The report made 42 recommendations and identified that Australia's biosecurity system required—ready, Madam Acting Deputy President?—additional resources. In the 2018 budget, the Liberal-National government committed to providing $325 million to biosecurity over three years. However, like everything with the government, the devil is in the detail, and the detail is a damning indictment of their lack of seriousness about Australia's biosecurity. The government botched the implementation of the levy, and there is now a $325 million budgetary hole. Biosecurity continues to be underresourced. The Morrison government delivered very little budget funding dedicated to biosecurity, despite the fact that we are currently experiencing a terrible pandemic. This just highlights that the Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management does not properly understand the responsibilities of his department with respect to the adequate resourcing of the biosecurity system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former independent Inspector-General of Biosecurity, a position the member for New England had tried to abolish back in 2014, found major failures in Australia's biosecurity system during her review into uncooked prawns, including that it was not providing an appropriate level of protection. The inspector-general, Dr Helen Scott-Orr, stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">During this review, I found several deficiencies in the management of the biosecurity risk of uncooked prawn imports, with broader implications for Australia's biosecurity risk management more generally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Scott-Orr further said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I found that specific policy elements and their implementation had sowed the seeds of failure many years before, while progressive and cumulative acts, omissions and systemic factors at many levels exacerbated the risks over time. Many of these failings have been swiftly addressed by the department and other stakeholders, but more needs to be done to manage the biosecurity risks of prawn imports in the future. I have made recommendations to improve this biosecurity risk management framework and its ability to deal with ongoing and emerging challenges. Long-term adequate resourcing will be a key success factor in this endeavour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Above all, detecting and deterring deliberate or inadvertent failures to implement biosecurity risk management policies effectively must be a priority. Governments and aquatic industries must cooperate to resource and implement these efforts. Failure to do so will imperil the future development of a sustainable and profitable aquaculture sector in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inspector-general stated that the department must 'remain vigilant, proactively review and update import requirements and policies, and maintain excellent communication with both government and industry stakeholders'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These findings from, I believe, 2016-17 can also be applied to the more recent biosecurity failings with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>. If they had been taken seriously across the department, possibly, we would not have seen the tragedy and dysfunction associated with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>. Instead, the Inspector-General of Biosecurity is now examining the effectiveness of the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment's systems, policies and processes in place to support biosecurity officers in the discharge of their frontline prevention biosecurity responsibilities, including in cooperation with other agencies. The Morrison government should hang their heads in shame that Australia's biosecurity system failed the Australian community. The minister for agriculture, Mr Littleproud, should have ensured his department was well resourced and vigilant with regard to potential biosecurity threats relating to COVID-19. Labor looks forward to seeing the recommendations from the inspector-general once his review is complete. However, there is no guarantee the Morrison government, unfortunately, will take the recommendations seriously. Sadly, for many families across Australia, the failings have cost them dearly, and our condolences go out to these families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current bill before the Senate will give the department more flexibility to deal with biosecurity breaches, and to issue larger fines as a form of deterrent—such as with African swine fever, which is a real threat to Australia's pork producers and could cost the industry up to $2 billion in losses. Whilst the government has provided some additional funding for ASF, and whilst COVID-19 has seen traveller numbers decrease to almost zero, the current Inspector-General of Biosecurity, Mr Rob Delane, has found similar failings within department systems as were found by the former inspector-general, Dr Scott-Orr, with white spot disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inspector-general's report is concerning. It identifies three strategic risks to the department's capability to effectively prevent ASF entering Australia, including:</span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I support the Biosecurity Amendment (Traveller Declarations and Other Measures) Bill 2020 as a clear example of good lawmaking to protect Australians, Australian rural industries, the safety of our country and the safety of our people. Disaster will occur if our border protections fail to prevent the entry of pests or diseases that have the potential to decimate our crops, kill our farm animals or infect our rural products such that whole industries could be wiped out. Our biosecurity officers and Australian Border Force officers are under constant strain to maintain the high level of protection needed to keep out these threats to our Australian way of life. They do a great job, and we thank them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nationwide loss of pollination services from European honey bees due to a multistate varroa mite incursion must be avoided. Introduced bacterial diseases such as European foulbrood could wipe out our bee population. Officers are constantly on alert nationwide to prevent the incursion of any new exotic fruit fly. A nationwide outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease would be catastrophic, as would, say, a bluetongue outbreak across Australia's major sheep-producing regions. These are just a few of the threats faced when products from overseas are introduced into our country. The devastation caused to our food chain would be almost incalculable if we lost our bee population. If bees fail to pollinate, we will lose those industries and crops that rely on bee pollination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to divert for a minute from protecting agriculture to protecting people. Border security is a fundamental federal responsibility. It's one of its four core responsibilities. This virus that is now among us, I'll say, has highlighted failures in border security. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>, which the previous speaker, Senator Sterle, spoke about, is one example. The ship's doctor's log was completely wrong, from what we're told, and there was nothing done about it. These point to matters of governance. All the major problems in this country that I can see on energy, water and property rights point to this city and to governance in Canberra. Problems keep coming because policies are not based on data. Policy in this country both under the Labor Party and the Greens and under the Liberal Party and the Nationals is not based on data. That's what's causing people to have grave doubts about the governance in this country. Governance is now based on emotion, vested interests, ideology, stories, fashions and fads. We now have governance in this country that is aiming to look good, not do good. I'm not just talking about the Liberal and National government that's in place; I'm talking about governance in the last 20 and 30 years. It has failed this country. There's been an inability to plan because there is a lack of data underpinning policy and plans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to contrast that with Taiwan. I'm making a plea to get back to data based policy rather than policy based science. That's not science. We have people invoking science, but they're doing it falsely, whether it be on reef regulations in Queensland or climate, energy or property rights being stolen. People are losing their incomes, losing their livelihoods, losing their futures and losing their industries. We are shipping industries overseas because we are not basing decisions on data. Let me give you an example—Taiwan. Taiwan have 24 million people. That's almost the same as our 25 million people in Australia. They have a much smaller area in which those 24 million people live, so it's much easier for them to transmit the virus. They're closer to China. They have many more interactions with communist China. They slammed the borders shut tight. Then they didn't shut down the whole country like we've done. They invoked testing, tracing and quarantining. They isolated the sick, they isolated the vulnerable and, as a result, even though they got the virus earlier than we did, in the time we've lost over 900 lives they've lost seven. And here's the punch line: they did not destroy their economy. Their economy has continued along steadily. Why? Because they trust their government. We don't have trust in government in this country, because government is not worthy of trust. That's the bottom line. We have to re-establish trust. That comes from making decisions and policies based on data.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while I'm talking about agriculture, it's extremely important to understand that we need to prevent these pests and diseases being introduced that affect humans as well as animals and crops. How do we prevent these pests and diseases being introduced? Strong deterrents are part of the answer. And that is the strength of this bill. I've just criticised the government of and governance in this country, but I'm going to compliment the government, because here's an example of a strong bill which is purposed to help militate against biosecurity risk. There is a light here shining, and it makes it through the pall hanging over Canberra from poor governance. This bill enables the Director of Biosecurity to determine that goods or classes of goods brought into the country without appropriate disclosure may attract a higher infringement notice penalty and provides that the determination is not going to be disallowed. We're in favour of that, because this country is worth protecting. It's worth keeping our borders secure.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People entering Australia must take seriously the need to 'comply carefully and accurately with requirements to provide written information for the purpose of assessing the level of biosecurity risk associated with the person and the goods they intend to bring into the country through their first point of entry, including airports and seaports. Quite frankly, any legislation that genuinely protects Australian rural industries is worthy of One Nation support'. This bill has our support.</span>

The Biosecurity Amendment (Traveller Declarations and Other Measures) Bill 2020 will amend the Biosecurity Act 2015 to provide for a flexible and proportionate compliance response through the targeted setting of amounts payable under an infringement notice. The bill will allow the biosecurity regulation to specify different penalty amounts and different periods of time to pay for infringement notices issued for different kinds of alleged contraventions of the Biosecurity Act, including by reference to the kind of goods or class of goods to which an alleged contravention relates.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll permit the Director of Biosecurity to make a non-disallowable legislative instrument to specify goods or classes of goods that can attract a higher infringement notice amount. These changes will enable incoming passengers or crew who fail to declare high-risk biosecurity goods listed in the legislative instrument to be issued with an infringement notice in the amount of 12 penalty points or $2,664. This is an increase from the current infringement notice amount of two penalty units or $444. It applies regardless of the relative risk of the goods to which the contravention relates.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e4t" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  Yesterday evening I gave background to the case against Cardinal Pell, former Archbishop of Sydney and Prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy in the Vatican. Today I continue the story by highlighting how Pell's serious efforts at financial reform brought him up against powerful forces determined to remove him. These were not Pell's only enemies, but they were formidable ones who were, for a time, successful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new economic framework for the Holy See saw major changes to the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See, APSA, transferred to the Secretariat for the Economy, to the Vatican's pension funds, to the Vatican media and to the Vatican bank. Pell became the economic tsar. The documents were in English rather than the traditional Italian. The Vatican's vast patrimony, including its property investments, became open to scrutiny. The Vatican old guard were not happy. By the end of his first year as prefect, Pell had put into place measures for financial competency and transparency and imposed key elements and structures of the new economic framework which became the Secretariat for the Economy and Council for the Economy. He brought in an auditor-general for independent oversight, something that had never been done or thought necessary before. In November 2014, he distributed a new handbook to all Vatican offices instituting financial management policies from 1 January 2015. Pell said at the time:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The purpose of the Manual is very simple. It brings Financial Management practices in line with international standards and will help all Entities and Administrations of the Holy See and the Vatican City State prepare financial reports in a consistent and transparent manner</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shortly after reporting in December 2014 that substantial funds—around 1.6 billion euros—were not being reported on the Vatican's balance sheet, in February 2015 the 'first strike' against the reform was launched by the Vatican's old guard. Cardinal Coccopalmerio, President of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, challenged the scope of the authority given to the secretariat and to Pell himself. He questioned the consolidation of management in the secretariat and the demand for transparency across Vatican entities. Coccopalmerio succeeded in seeing the statutes of each of the entities of the secretariat, the council and the auditor-general re-dimensioned. Pell's secretariat lost power over Vatican properties, making it more difficult to discover malfeasance.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reasons for this move are now obvious, with the recent downfall of Cardinal Becciu. In June 2015, former chairman of Deloitte Italy, Libero Milone, was announced as inaugural Auditor-General of the Vatican. With his appointment, the investigative arm of the economic blueprint was put in place. The reform was gaining ground but the opposition was mounting, with increasing complaints about Pell's 'Anglo management style' and delays in compliance by Vatican entities. These were explained away as uncertainty about the completely new approach, despite resources being made available from the new financial bodies to assist with compliance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pell placed the final plank in the economic reform in December 2015 with the first ever audit of the entire Vatican finances by PricewaterhouseCoopers, to approval from financial experts worldwide. Becciu had every reason to oppose this audit, as it would uncover that the Secretariat of State had effectively run its own bank, which was being administered principally by Becciu himself. Moreover, Becciu has been linked to a number of highly speculative financial deals involving London property. These are alleged to have benefited not only the financiers involved in the deals but even members of Becciu's own family. As more details emerge, it is hoped that cooperation between Vatican authorities and governments around the world, including Australia, will elicit the destination of Vatican funds in those countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The year 2016 became the year of bringing Pell down. First, his enemies questioned whether he had the power to do something in the Vatican, a typical old guard move. Cardinal Parolin, appointed in 2013 as Secretary of State, was known for his outspoken opposition to the Pope's efforts at financial reform. Media reports outlined the extent of their clashes. In April 2016, Parolin, backed by Becciu's directive to all Vatican entities, suspended the comprehensive audit. Another blow came in July 2016 when, by a 'motu proprio' legislative act, the Pope removed some of the powers invested in the Secretariat for the Economy, giving them back to APSA, including its data centre and authority over property and staff payments. APSA's president, Cardinal Calcagno, was considered to be corrupt, with media reports of alleged misappropriation of funds and covering up child abuse in his former diocese. APSA itself had been a centre of money laundering, with the infamous case of Nunzio Scarano, otherwise known as 'Monsignore Cinquecento'—Monsignor 500—as a result of his penchant for money and an expensive lifestyle. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the financial questions about APSA remain unresolved to this day. On numerous occasions, Pell, aware of these questions of continued corruption, had been assured that Calcagno would be removed. In typical Vatican style, he eventually would retire without investigation. It is worth noting that the powers handed to APSA and away from Pell and his secretariat were restored to the Secretariat for the Economy in May 2020, upon Pell's acquittal. Pell's successor, Father Guerrero, succeeded in convincing the Pope that there was an obvious conflict of interest if APSA retained the ability to alter data pertaining to financial transactions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time, unbeknownst to Pell, authorities in Australia were investigating complaints against him. It is important to note the timing, as it coincided with mounting resistance to Pell from Vatican officials. In October 2016 Shane Patton, then the Victorian deputy police commissioner, and other officers travelled to Rome to interview Pell. This interview is available on the public record. Pell's demeanour in the interview demonstrates an innocent man detailing how preposterous and impossible it was for the crimes to have occurred as alleged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Rome, APSA continued its further opposition to the financial reforms. In May 2017 its secretary sent a letter to all dicasteri, or ministries, telling them to refuse to submit their accounts to the external auditor. Pell and Milone also sent letters, insisting on their mandate to require that dicasteri comply with the established norms. The secretariat was uncovering serious irregularities and wanted to proceed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 19 June, just a few weeks after Pell foreshadowed privately that a 'moment of truth' for those involved in financial corruption was coming, Milone's office was raided by the Vatican police. Becciu accused him of spying on the Secretariat of State. Milone was interrogated and, on the next day, announced his resignation. He said sometime later that he had been threatened with arrest if he did not resign. Nearly a year later this outlandish allegation was quietly dropped, with Milone suing the Vatican for loss of employment and damages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 29 June 2017 then Deputy Commissioner Patton announced that Victoria Police was charging Pell with multiple offences. On the same day, Pell stated that he would return to Australia for his day in court in order to fight the charges, declaring, 'I am innocent of these charges.' It should be made clear that Pell returned to Australia voluntarily. He could have remained in Rome, as his diplomatic status preserved him from facing trial. But that is not in his character.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 10 July 2017 Pell left Rome. Effectively the economic reform was over. There is an old saying in the Vatican: whatever happens, never leave Rome or you admit defeat. Pell, it seems, had lost. In essence the Vatican enemies had prevailed. In an article earlier this year titled 'Operation Get-Pell; were the bullets made in Rome?', Kathy Clubb referred to an article from March 2019 by Vatican insider Marco Tosatti, titled 'The cannons in Australia, the bullets manufactured in the Vatican'. By this, Tosatti referred to remarks from clergy in Rome that, while the alleged crimes were in Australia, the prime movers behind 'Operation Get Pell' were in Rome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through my recent correspondence with AUSTRAC and questioning of AUSTRAC at estimates, we know allegations of suspicious transfers from the Vatican to Australia were investigated and that 'actionable financial intelligence' passed to the AFP and Victoria Police. On 21 October I wrote to AFP Commissioner Kershaw and Victoria Police Commissioner Patton about this matter. I was disappointed to read media reports only two days later that Victoria Police had noted advice from AUSTRAC but stated, 'We are not at this time conducting any further investigations.' We will discover in coming weeks the possible motives for quietly archiving intelligence and refraining from conducting any further investigation. We must rely on the continued investigation of the AFP to get to the bottom of this complicated affair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many Australians there are unresolved issues that require examination, including the role of Pell in the Catholic clergy abuse crisis, the role of Victoria Police and Operation Tethering, and the financial connections between individuals and entities in Australia and the Vatican. They also have legitimate questions about the media's vilification of Pell and the role of clergy and lay Catholic opponents of Pell. Understanding this will help us determine how bullets forged in the Vatican resulted in cannons being fired in Australia. To be continued.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  First, I acknowledge that we meet on the land of the Ngunawal and Ngambri people, and I pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year I asked if this parliament took the pride it should in our First Australians. It is a profound honour to work for the custodians of the oldest continuous civilisation on earth, and it is a profound honour to sit in a federal Labor caucus with a growing First Nations caucus: the member for Barton, Ms Linda Burney; Senator McCarthy; and, of course, the father of reconciliation, Senator Dodson. I also want to acknowledge and welcome Senator Thorpe, who has recently taken her place in the Senate, and I thank Paul House for his welcome to country and the smoking ceremony yesterday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NAIDOC Week is about celebrating the history, culture and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It was a moving act of reconciliation this week when Indigenous Australians sought to have the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags displayed here in the Senate, despite the years of being failed by the people who have filled these benches. It was an embarrassing lack of grace that, in this week of all weeks, Morrison government senators said no. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is just yet another reminder to all of us non-Indigenous Australians in this NAIDOC Week of the importance of listening and learning. Not just in NAIDOC Week but all year round I am grateful to be able to learn from our First Nations caucus and, in the interests of listening, the majority of Labor's speaking time today in NAIDOC Week will be taken by Senator Dodson and Senator McCarthy. As part of my support for our First Nations caucus and the determination I share with my colleagues for First Nations people to know they have allies in this place, I reiterate Labor's commitment to listening and learning, which goes to the core of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are committed to the Uluru statement in full. We are committed to the Indigenous voice to the parliament enshrined in the Constitution. There should be no controversy over Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders being consulted about issues that directly affect them. We are committed to a makarrata commission that will oversee agreement- and treaty-making. We are committed to a national process of truth-telling. We have to acknowledge and address the facts of our history or they will haunt us forever. It is a history that is still not known widely enough—the crimes and massacres perpetrated on Aboriginal people and their culture, including the frontier wars, the stolen generations and ongoing injustices today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even less known are many of the achievements of Aboriginal civilisation. Thanks to the works of writers like Bruce Pascoe and Bill Gammage popular understanding of our continent before European colonisation is growing. We are no longer trapped in the ignorance of our own assumptions and prejudice, premised on the underlying supremacism of the narrative that white people know best. Bruce Pascoe writes of Australia before colonisation with First Nations people engaging in complex water management and agriculture and living in sophisticated housing amongst villages—none of which fit the definition of a hunter-gatherer. 'Could it be,' he asks, 'that the accepted view of Indigenous Australians simply wandering from plant to plant, kangaroo to kangaroo in hapless opportunism was incorrect?' Gammage describes the trade webs meshing thousands of kilometres as being amongst the most extensive systems of human communication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without knowing these facts and so much more we allow ourselves to diminish the value of the lives and culture that were upended with European colonisation. But when we listen and we learn, we can come to understand the true rich history of the land we live on, the place this has been and the country we could become. We can then share the passion and the pride that our Indigenous Australians so rightly feel. We can understand the truth that for too long was not taught—that this is a land where sovereignty was never ceded. It always was and always will be Aboriginal land.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250156" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  [by video link] The WA community understand the urgent need to take action to address the climate crisis. We know that climate change is shaping our present right now. We also know that failure to act will condemn our communities across the state to struggle against the impacts of climate change for generation after generation. We understand that we are in many ways at the frontline of the work that needs to be done to address that climate crisis, because many of the corporations that have for so long dominated our state and its politics have used their influence to prop up industries which are dirty and polluting. We understand that the LNG industry in Western Australia in particular is one of the primary causes of our emissions as a state. We understand that many of the projects that have been put forward in the last few years, if they come to fruition, advocated as they are by big corporations, would amount to emissions, to impacts upon climate change, that would make it impossible to take action on climate change. We know that the Gorgon project alone, if allowed to continue, would amount to an emissions profile four times greater than the Adani Carmichael mine. We know that the proposed facilities for the opening up of the Browse and Scarborough gas fields in WA will alone account for 47 percent of WA's annual emissions. And we know that this is just not sustainable. It should not happen in a state where, overwhelmingly, people want action on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for this reason that the Greens in Western Australia, in the last sitting of the state parliament, brought forward a climate bill, a piece of legislation that would have begun the urgent work that was needed, and is needed now, to address the climate crisis, to bring down our emissions, to transition away from these dirty, polluting industries and to support communities in that transition. This piece of legislation was supported by over 30 scientists across our community and was incredibly well championed by our state MLC Tim Clifford, the WA Greens climate spokesperson. We intended to bring that legislation before the parliament to have a robust debate on it and, hopefully, to win the parliament's and the chamber's support for it. It was also an opportunity for Mark McGowan's Labor government to prove that the hundreds of thousands of dollars that the government has taken in donations from Chevron and from Woodside would not be front of mind and that the government would, in fact, support the community and support the environment by taking action and supporting this bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been made very clear to the people of WA over the past 12 months that, when the major parties decide that action is needed to address a crisis in our state, that action will be taken. We have seen extraordinary and, in many ways, transformative action taken in relation to the COVID crisis in our state, so people clearly know that when the government wants to act it can and it does. Yet, when the legislation was brought forward and the opportunity was given to vote on this bill, the government basically gagged the debate. The environment minister, Stephen Dawson, did not even turn up. Mark McGowan's Labor government in Western Australia was not even willing to vote on this piece of legislation, and the bloke whose job it is to turn up for these moments in parliament and talk to the government's position didn't even turn up for the debate. Many people in our community are frustrated with politics right now because of this disconnect, this disparity, this lack of action. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a community, we have worked incredibly hard over the past 12 months or more to get on top of COVID in our state. We have worked together to support each other through a really difficult time. We know that what lies before us now is a project of recovery from the health impacts of COVID-19 on the general community. As a community, we want to recover from this crisis in a way that addresses the climate crisis. We have not done all this work for the last 12 months to have a gas powered recovery forced upon us by parties that are in the pockets of Chevron, Woodside and all the rest of the corporate titans that feel as though they have been able to run the state of Western Australia with impunity for the last hundred years or more. We want—the community of WA demand—a rebuild from this crisis that takes action on climate change, that protects our environment and that safeguards our old-growth forests. I must now mention as well the wonderful work of the WA Forest Alliance, currently campaigning, right now, to end native forest logging in Western Australia. Native forest logging is an industry which is not only destroying our precious natural places but also running down and turning into wood chip some of our planet's most effective mechanisms for drawing carbon down into the soil and redressing the chemical imbalances that are driving climate change. Our community is alive with the desire for action. We have sacrificed through this period to keep ourselves safe and to keep those we love safe, and we are rejoicing in the opportunity that we now have to embrace each other and to come back together ahead of Christmas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look to the work that will need to be done in the next year and in the years ahead, we are ready for it. We are ready to get to work. We do demand, however, that as we do that work the parties of government join with us in ensuring those projects align with our goals of taking action on climate change and protecting our environment. In not allowing this climate bill even to be voted on, in failing to ensure that the minister for the environment turned up to the damned debate, the McGowan government have sent a clear message to the people of Western Australia that they are not serious about taking urgent action on climate change. It is clear to us in the WA community that if climate action is to be achieved there must be more Greens voices in the parliament after our state election in March. Only then it seems, with enough Greens MPs in there to demand proper action, will we see action taken in parliament within the critical time periods that we know exist in relation to the climate crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate my good colleague and friend Tim Clifford on his work in crafting the bill and putting it before the parliament. I was disappointed in the extreme to see it so casually blocked, with not even a vote given. I look forward to campaigning with him and with the entire community in the run-up to the state election to ensure that Mark McGowan's Labor government is sent a strong message that our community demands action and that it will not accept any government of any colour wasting this opportunity for climate action or destroying our precious places just because they want a continuous stream of donations into their back pockets ahead of a state election and to keep the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> newspaper happy. Our community in WA deserves a hell of a lot better than that, and that is what the Greens will continue to deliver in Western Australia. I thank the chamber for its time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  I rise today to make a short contribution about a big part of our country, a big part of our nation: northern Australia. Only six per cent of Australians live, broadly speaking, north of the Tropic of Capricorn, but northern Australia makes up 40 per cent of our land mass and makes a huge contribution to our country and to our nation. It is for that reason that the federal government established a white paper on northern Australia. For a period of time I had the honour to be the minister for northern Australia, overseeing that plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to provide some remarks in response to the ministerial statement—the fifth annual statement of our 20-year plan to develop northern Australia—that was provided by Minister Keith Pitt in the other place last month. We're about a quarter of the way in now to a nation-building plan to get northern Australia going. It was good to see in the minister's update that, I think, 46 of the 51 measures in the white paper have been implemented. They're almost all in place, and lots of good things are happening right across the north.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I get to some of those, I want to spend time reiterating why we are doing this. Why should the federal government take a focus on the north of our nation? Just six per cent of Australians live there, but northern Australia accounts for over half of our nation's exports. So over half of our export dollars originate from areas of our country to the north of us here and to the north of the Tropic of Capricorn. By God, we have needed those exports this year as our economy has suffered through the coronavirus pandemic, but we have all been lifted up and kept somewhat whole through the massive amounts of iron ore exports, coal exports, gas exports and agricultural exports that flow from northern Australia. Normally, there's a significant amount of tourism too, in the north, in places like the Great Barrier Reef, Broome, Darwin, Arnhem Land and other central locations—some beautiful parts of the Northern Territory—to attract people from all over the world. It's closed for now but it'll be back better than ever. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also huge opportunity in the north, as you'd expect from Arrernte country, that we haven't fully developed like other parts of our nation or haven't developed as much. There has been development. I reject the notion that the area hasn't developed. That's indicated by the fact that half our exports come from northern Australia. There's been a lot of development, but there's a lot more to do too. It is 40 per cent of our land mass but it also has 60 per cent of our rainfall. Sixty per cent of water falls on lands in northern Australia. Yet there are very few dams or water infrastructure in the north relative to what we have, say, in the Murray-Darling where I speak to you from today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Northern Australia is strategically placed, facing north to many parts of the world that are growing considerably. More than half the world's middle class are expected to reside in our region, in the Asian region, by 2030, in 10 years time. Northern Australia has excellent access to good ports like Darwin, the coal ports in North Queensland and the iron ore ports in Western Australia, in Wyndham, near the Ord project. They are all very attractively placed to take advantage of that economic growth and create opportunities for all Australians as well. That is a final reason we should invest in northern Australia. It would be good for all of Australia if the north continued to grow and develop. Too many Australians are concentrated in just a few cities. Well over half, over 60 per cent, of our population resides in our top five capital cities. That's a very high proportion compared to a country like America, where only 10 or 15 per cent of their population resides in their top five cities. We could spread out more and have more space and better housing affordability, and put less pressure on public transport, if we developed other economic opportunities around the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot has been achieved in the five years we've been pushing the northern Australia plan. I forgot to mention at the start that I want to recognise the efforts of former Senator Ian Macdonald, who was integral in getting the plan going. Mr Warren Entsch, the member for Leichhardt, has also played a key role over the years, pushing for an agenda like this, and he remains the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia, overseeing all the good works that are happening. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the best things happening is the roads we're building as part of this project. Those arteries that we're building, particularly east-west across our nation, are connecting up parts of our country where it previously took a long time to get from A to B. I had the privilege, recently, of driving on some of the roads we're investing in. They included the Outback Way, which is a road that links up Winton and Laverton in south-west Western Australia. The government has allocated over $500 million to that road. It'll be just the third sealed road across our continent. We're a vast continent, a big country, but we only have two ways you can drive from one side of it to the other and stay on bitumen the whole way. This will create that third route and will massively open up places. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was driving on those roads between Winton and Boulia, a few months ago, with the state member for Gregory, Lachlan Millar. It was great to see upgraded roads there, creating opportunities for people in western Queensland, hooking up to the Northern Territory. I was going to drive the Outback Way on the way back from the Northern Territory, from Alice to Boulia, but I was advised by the locals that unless I had a couple of tyres I was taking a bit of a risk to get back on time, so I diverted up to the Barkly, up through Tennant Creek. But eventually we are going to upgrade that route. That is yet to be upgraded, but we will upgrade the Alice Springs to Boulia route and allow people in that region to get proper access. I don't have time to go through all the other roads. The Hann Highway created the first inland route from Cairns to Melbourne, which was incredibly important, particularly for banana and avocado growers in the Tablelands region around Cairns. The Keep River Road is opening up mining opportunities. There are agricultural opportunities on the Ord on the border of northern Australia and Western Australia. There's the Tanami Road as well. It's massively important. I am going to run out of time here. There is much to go through here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the dams we are building. The Rookwood Weir is finally being built on the Fitzroy River near Rockhampton. It's going to double agriculture in the Fitzroy basin. It was great to see that finally the state Labor government, just a few days before the election a few weeks ago, committed to the Urannah Dam project. They finally said that they will actually ask the federal government to invest in the dam. It's taken five years of the northern Australia program, but finally the Queensland government are on board. So that is fantastic. I look forward to that application getting Urannah Dam going in the Upper Burdekin, the system near Mackay, Bowen and Collinsville. It's a great opportunity for them. There's a lot more to do on dams and there's a lot of work that has been done ready to set up to build more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a little bit about the achievements of the northern Australia infrastructure fund, a $5 billion fund which has now put $2.4 billion of investments into projects doing great things like building a new meatworks in Central Queensland, the first inland meatworks being built for some time in Australia. James Cook University is upgrading a technology park. There's the Townsville Airport and new power in a very innovative hydro project. An old goldmine in Kidston is being invested in by the northern Australia infrastructure fund. What I believe is the first fully Indigenous owned iron ore mine in Australia is being funded by the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility as well, which I think is a fantastic thing. I recognise the efforts of Fortescue to help bring that about. The NAIF has helped finance that. I think this is the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might segue to future opportunities. I think the future focus for the northern Australian agenda has to be not just creating jobs for Indigenous Australians but creating businesses for Indigenous Australians to own. The plan has achieved significant success in enforcing employment targets on all those road projects and water projects I mentioned. They all have targets for Indigenous employment. So if a council is getting some money to build a road it has to employ a set minimum of Indigenous Australians. That has been fantastic, but the next step is to try to support businesses to be owned by Indigenous Australians so they're not just working on the roads; they actually have the contract to build the roads. It's so they are not just getting training in a mine but they actually own a mine or have board positions on a mine so they can take control of their destiny and benefit from the growth in northern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final thing I wanted to mention on future opportunities is partnering with other countries through the northern Australia agenda. We've heard a lot this year about our need to diversify our exports and trading relationships. The north, I believe, is the platform best served to do that. We've seen the Adani investment in northern Australia recently establish stronger investment in trade links with India. There's a lot more to do with India, especially in the agricultural opportunities of the Fitzroy and the west and east Kimberley areas of Western Australia. They are completely suitable for the Indian subcontinent. They have a countercyclical climate to the subcontinent as well, which would make sense for partnering in investment opportunities there. And of course there is the growth in South-East Asia that we are seeing in Vietnam and Indonesia. There are significant opportunities to deepen relationships with those countries through our northern Australian agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is something we need to persist with. I recognise the general bipartisan support the agenda has received. I hope that can continue, because it's important for our whole country that we develop the north of our nation as well.</span>

                  <a href="SR5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DODSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  In this NAIDOC Week, with its theme of 'Always Was, Always Will Be', I wish to acknowledge all the old people who've paved the way for Aboriginal people to be sitting in this chamber and in the other place. Imagine if those who took part in the day of mourning in 1938, the year of Australia's 150th anniversary, could witness the attendance in the federal parliament nowadays of six First Nations members and senators—although I dare say they might be bemused by the party allegiances we have!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Senate has its rules and protocols. Mostly they serve to accord dignity and respect for us as politicians. But yesterday, the third day of NAIDOC Week, we lost an important motion to fly the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags in this chamber. To have our flags alongside the Australian flag would have enhanced our maturity as a modern democracy, in control of our own destiny. In time, the display could have become like the kangaroo and emu on the Coat of Arms that sits proudly above the President's seat. If I were a cynic, and I'm not, I could conclude that the flora and fauna still have precedence above the First Nations peoples of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What principle or protocol did the naysayers rely on yesterday to block those flags from being displayed here? The government told us that the Australian national flag is the only 'appropriate' flag to be flown in the Senate chamber. What, I ask, is inappropriate about flying the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags? They're both recognised as Australian flags under the Flags Act 1953. What adverse reactions do those opposite really fear would flow if our flags were on display? What is it that this government is really afraid of? It seems to me that it's just incapable of envisaging that our flags would be a complementing adornment to the Australian national flag that the government says represents all Australians. Our flags fly all over towns on any other day. Out the front of this building right now, there are 44 flags flying, and only 16 of them are the Australian national flag. What are the other 28? They're the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags. There's a line-up that represents all Australians. They're good enough for display outside Parliament House during NAIDOC Week but not good enough to be flown in this house. We need more generosity around this here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday I had the honour of launching a book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Unbreakable Rock</span>. It has resonance with 'Always Was, Always Will Be'. The book was written by an old friend of mine, the late Michael Bowden, who used to play for Richmond. Michael found a new meaning to life through his experience as a teacher and a community worker in Central Australia and through his friendships forged with a precious circle of Arrernte women. His book is about discovering mystery through the lens of the Arrernte people's belief in Altyerre. Most of you would think of Altyerre as the Dreaming, but it's more than that. It's about a state of being. It's about the interrelationship and connectivity between humans and humans, humans and creation and humans and the creator, in whatever form that may be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mike Bowden passed away earlier this year, but his legacy of having followed the road less travelled is preserved in his book. I commend it to others in this chamber for reading over Christmas. You might take up the books referred to by the leader of the Labor Party in this place as well. You would read, for example, Mike's deconstruction of the Lord's Prayer, which opens the proceedings of this place every morning. For instance, when we say, 'Forgive us our sins,' the Arrernte rendition is, 'Walk with us in our troubles.' Reflecting on such perspectives may assist you to overcome any inhibitions you might hold about truly recognising First Nations peoples in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My friend Mike Bowden and his Aboriginal informants came from two very different belief systems, of course. But they found a new and common ground out of mutual trust, respect and genuine communication. That relationship led Michael to plumb the depths of Arrernte spirituality and ponder how those Arrernte women were able to accommodate and practice Catholicism in spite of colonialism, settlement and Christian dogma.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's clear to me is that, historically, accommodation in this country has been one way. That's been the pattern of our relationship since colonisation and settlement. The colonisers yield very little or nothing and expect—demand, even—that First Nations peoples fall in behind. We need to understand each other better, to realise our fragility as humans, in spite of the sublime technical achievements we've made—a fragility and fickleness that are laid bare in the face of the forces of nature, like floods and famines and fires. Without a sincere and honest dialogue across cultural and social divides, we'll continue to be ignorant of the rich contributions we can make to each other. In Michael Bowden's case, he was prepared to listen and learn, and he reaped great personal benefit from that shared experience. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it that this government cannot listen and learn? What passes as consultation when it comes to developing policies affecting First Nations peoples is often a hollow sham. Take, for example, the government's intention to foist the cashless debit card onto 25,000 welfare recipients in the Northern Territory; more than 80 per cent of them are Aboriginal people. I've had Aboriginal people from Central Australia come to my office here in parliament and tell me they don't want the card. They want to be rid of the income management system. They want the government to get out of their lives. But the government remains hell-bent on wanting to punish the poor and telling them how they should spend their money. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And why hasn't this government been prepared to accept without qualification the Uluru Statement from the Heart and all its three components—voice, treaty, truth—and the explicit wish of First Nations peoples that a voice to parliament be enshrined in the Constitution? We on our side have been unwavering in our support for the Uluru statement in full. It's more than 3½ years since the Uluru convention that was preceded by over 13 regional national dialogues across the country. First Nations have spoken already. Why hasn't this government simply accepted the Uluru statement—rather than waiting to mould and manipulate a statement into a pattern for its own purposes—as we in the Labor opposition have?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This NAIDOC Week is really an opportunity to celebrate, but it's also an opportunity for some hard-headed reflections on what's happening to First Nations peoples in their environment right now. We can't ignore the simmering outrage against blights on our psyche and on our landscape, like the destruction of those 46,000-year-old caves at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. With other members of the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia, I saw firsthand last week the catastrophe which has been visited upon the Puutu Kunti Kurrama people and the Pinikura people. We saw the irreplaceable damage and we witnessed the grief and sorrow of the people. Then there's the shimmering outrage against the persistent and disproportionate rates of incarceration and black deaths in custody and the removal of Aboriginal children from their families. We can do better as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Always will, always will be' is the theme of NAIDOC Week. The real celebration should be that, despite the society we live in, First Nations have survived. One day we will be rightly recognised and one day, I hope, our flags will adorn this chamber.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:28</span>):  Today I will move a motion in relation to the status of Taiwan, an island territory that is a flourishing constitutional democracy with nearly 24 million people and is a key Australian trading partner. I want to take the opportunity to speak about the background to that motion. While much of the media and public attention has been focused on the drama of the US presidential election campaign, closer to home the Taiwan Strait has emerged as a strategic flashpoint. This is a situation with very important implications for the peace and security of the Asia-Pacific region and for Australia's national security. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Chinese communist regime in Beijing claims Taiwan as an absolute core interest of sovereignty and territorial integrity. This is a strongly assertive claim that is made in spite of the fact that, apart from a brief period between the end of the Second World War and the communist victory in the Chinese civil war in 1949, Taiwan has not been controlled by a regime in Beijing since 1895. China's and Taiwan's paths diverged a long time ago, but the Chinese Communist Party is quite unreconciled with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the early 1970s, the United States and Australia have held to a policy of strategic ambiguity in relation to Taiwan, acknowledging Beijing's claim to Taiwan while maintaining extensive unofficial relations with Taipei. We have long been insistent that Taiwan's autonomous status must not be changed by force or by threat of force. For some four decades, China has undertaken to pursue reunification through peaceful means. Provided China accepted the status quo and pursued peaceful trade and other contracts across the Taiwan Strait, all seemed well. Over recent decades, however, Taiwan's vibrant democracy has demonstrated little interest in subordinating its freedoms to the Chinese Communist Party. In response, President Xi's regime has stepped up nationalistic rhetoric about Taiwan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the Chinese National People's Congress dropped the word 'peaceful' from its stated objective of securing Taiwan's reunification with the Chinese mainland. At Senate estimates last month, Frances Adamson, the secretary of our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and a diplomat with much experience in China, observed that it was 'a notable omission' and that our diplomats were 'frankly, concerned by it'. That shift in position at the top of the Chinese political system has been accompanied by an escalation of Chinese air force and naval incursions into Taiwanese airspace and waters. While there appears to be no indication of an immediate move towards military action, Beijing has very deliberately turned up the temperature in the Taiwan Strait.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">China has engaged in or threatened military action on three previous occasions: in 1954-55, in 1958 and in 1995-96. When I asked Ms Adamson at estimates whether there was a risk of another Taiwan Strait crisis in the near or medium future, she gave a very diplomatic but significant reply. She said that she hoped we wouldn't get to that point but went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is certainly something I would be more concerned about this year than a year ago or possibly in fact at any time over the last 3½ decades that I've worked on this subject …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United States and Australia have responded to Beijing's increasingly belligerent position. The US has stepped up high level contact with Taiwan, with visits by the US Secretary of Health and Human Services and a US under secretary of state. President-elect Joe Biden has indicated he intends to take a firm position in relation to China, including Beijing's ambitions towards Taiwan. Taiwan featured in the AUSMIN communique issued by our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence and the US Secretary of State and US Secretary of Defense after their meeting in the US in July. Taiwan had last been mentioned in an AUSMIN communique 15 years previously, in 2005, and that was only a brief mention that called on China and Taiwan to resolve their differences peacefully through negotiation. The July 2020 AUSMIN communique contained a much stronger statement in which the US and Australian governments reaffirmed:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… Taiwan's important role in the Indo-Pacific region as well as their intent to maintain strong unofficial ties with Taiwan and to support Taiwan's membership in international organisations where statehood is not a prerequisite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The US and Australia further expressed a resolve to support Taiwan and:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… reiterated that any resolution of cross-Strait differences should be peaceful and according to the will of the people on both sides, without resorting to threats or coercion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the most recent indication is that China is determined to increase pressure on Taiwan. Despite Taiwan's tremendous success in suppressing the COVID-19 outbreak, China continues to veto Taiwan's informal participation in the World Health Organization. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Saturday, the official publication of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference ran an important op-ed written by Wang Zaixi, a former senior official in China's State Council Taiwan Affairs Office. Wang candidly acknowledged that political opinion in Taiwan had developed decisively in strong opposition to eventual reunification. He observed that the Taiwanese Democratic Progressive Party has very effectively marginalised the pro-Beijing political opposition. The Chinese Communist Party views Taiwanese democracy as a grave and persistent problem. Against this backdrop, Wang observed, 'It may be difficult to achieve the goal of cross-Strait reunification without using military force.' As a number of expert Chinese watchers have pointed out, this is the first time that a senior Chinese Communist Party official, current or former, has publicly raised the prospect of using armed force to secure Taiwan, since the CCP leader Deng Xiaoping called for peaceful reunification in 1979. Coming after the earlier tweak in the National People's Congress position and the step-up of Chinese military activity, these comments could well signal a further hardening of China's stance. The use of armed force, the threat of invasion, might still be a last resort, but it's now clearly on the table. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where does this leave the United States and Australia? Regrettably, the longstanding policy of strategic ambiguity may well have run its course, and it will be necessary to face major decisions about our relations with Taiwan. It is consistent with Australia's values and national interest that we support Taiwan's democratic autonomy and strongly oppose any attempts to change Taiwan's status by force or threat of force. I don't think it could be in any way acceptable to allow the Taiwanese democracy and the fate of nearly 24 million people to be subject to military coercion and, if unsupported, force surrendered to Beijing. It would involve a betrayal of democratic principles and a strategic setback of grave significance for Australia's security in the Asia-Pacific region. For those with a sense of history, a failure to support Taiwan's democracy and autonomy would be comparable with the Munich settlement of 1938 and the resultant Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. If we are to avoid these challenges, we need to send Beijing some very clear messages about Taiwan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion I will put to the Senate for consideration later today draws on the language of the July AUSMIN communique and lays out several key principles: that Australia should unequivocally express our longstanding view that any resolution of the cross-Strait differences between China and Taiwan must be peaceful, that threats from China to employ military force against Taiwan constitutes a threat to peace and security in the Pacific region and that the Australian Senate should express strong support for Taiwan's autonomy and democracy and the absolute right of the Taiwanese people to determine their own future free from threats of coercion. I trust that such a statement of these important principles will enjoy the full support of the Senate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ZN4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Firstly, on this Remembrance Day, I want to acknowledge all serving defence personnel, our veterans and, of course, the tens of thousands of Australians who made the ultimate sacrifice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 global pandemic has presented the Morrison government with one of Australia's greatest national challenges. Lives have been lost, our economy has been dragged to its knees and the financial and mental health toll on so many Australians has been beyond anything we have experienced since, perhaps, the Second World War. From the outset, our government's focus has been to protect lives and livelihoods. This has been our mission, this has driven all of our decisions and this has resulted in Australia combating this pandemic better than, perhaps, any other country in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the beginning of 2020 we had drought, bushfires and floods. In our 2020 budget, the Morrison government is delivering the economic lifeline that Australians need to get through the course of this virus and to forge our economic recovery. Led by the Prime Minister, our government has focused on what we need to do to reopen the economy and to keep it open, a COVID-safe economy. We are seeing strong signs of that momentum and growing confidence in our economy—a key driver of investment and of jobs growth. In the last four months 450,000 jobs have been created. Sixty per cent of those jobs have gone to women and 40 per cent to young people. Of the 1.3 million people who lost their job or who were stood down on zero hours, I am very pleased to report that 750,000, or around 60 per cent, of those people are now back at work. When the national cabinet meets again on Friday, the Prime Minister will continue to show the leadership that this country requires, working with the state premiers and first ministers to chart the course for recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is this government's job to stand by Australians, and that is exactly what we are doing. That is why we are providing billions of dollars of support in programs such as JobKeeper, JobSeeker, JobMaker, tax cuts for 11 million Australians and support for young jobseekers, apprentices, trainees, pensioners and seniors. In relation to JobSeeker—a very important measure, one of which we are very proud—as we have announced, the Morrison government will extend the temporary enhanced support through the social security system for a further three months through to 31 March next year, as our economic confidence and momentum builds. As part of that extension, the coronavirus supplement will be paid at a rate of $150 per fortnight between 1 January and 31 March. The supplement is paid to every jobseeker on top of the base rate, effectively increasing the rate to $715 per fortnight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout this period one of the most important initiatives has been JobKeeper. Everywhere I go so many Australians talk about this being an incredible lifeline. This has allowed 3.5 million Australians to obtain an income to support their families, to retain their dignity and, crucially, to keep a connection with their workplace and with their employer. The investments that we have made in JobKeeper have amounted to some $101 billion. Of course, this has been so significant in increasing incomes and confidence and supporting households and businesses to get back on their feet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The package of measures that we have delivered throughout this year and as announced in our budget are expected to result in economic activity being 4.5 per cent higher by 2021 and the peak of the unemployment rate being lower by around five percentage points than otherwise would have occurred. Without the government's economic support, the unemployment rate would have risen and remained above 12 per cent throughout 2020-21 and 2021-22. And I have to say, on our watch, we were not prepared to let that happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Elderly Australians have been some of the most vulnerable, and I'm very proud of the work that the Morrison government has done to support elderly Australians, including $1.6 billion to assist senior Australians in aged care during this pandemic. This includes such important measures as quality and safety monitoring investment, support for retaining the aged-care workforce, the provision of an additional surge workforce, assistance to the sector with additional costs and funding to support older Australians to stay at home as well as the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre, which, as we know, needed particular support due to what happened in my home state of Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mental health of Australians has also been a critical focus of our government, and, I have to say, I think it's been one of the most pressing issues in our community. We have responded with substantial investment, including providing more than $300 million to support a doubling of Medicare funded psychological services, which have been so instrumental in keeping people okay—though we acknowledge that this has been so tough for so many people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our military has provided the nation with outstanding service during the pandemic. I put on the record again that it remains one of the most regrettable and tragic decisions of this period that the Victorian government did not take up our offer of ADF support and properly and responsibly plan for Victoria's hotel quarantine program, which, as we now know, became a disaster. As has now been revealed, this scandalous hotel quarantine program has cost my home state of Victoria, in terms of dollars alone, $195 million against the original allocation of $80 million. And, as we know, and as the evidence has told us, more than 800 people have died as a direct result of the failures in hotel quarantine. That's more than 800 people, compared with 55 deaths in New South Wales. As the Treasurer has rightly said, the comparison for us as a state, in Victoria, is not with other countries—not the United States, not the United Kingdom—but with the performance of other states such as Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales. I also want to put on the record that my heart goes out to the family and friends of those who have lost their loved ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to briefly raise concerns, in relation to the hotel quarantine inquiry, about the very significant waste of taxpayers' money we have seen in the state. There's been a declaration that legal fees alone have cost several million dollars. However, I suspect that, based on the duration of the inquiry and the number of lawyers and law firms involved, those costs are going to blow out very, very substantially. I'm also very concerned to see that in my own region, at the Sands Hotel in Torquay, which is now in receivership, an agreement was reached between the Victorian government and the hotel for payment of 55 rooms over two months, involving more than $500,000 of taxpayers' funds, and not one room was ever used. Even though one month's purchase of rooms occurred and no rooms were used, such was the lack of safeguard of taxpayers' dollars that the Victorian government turned around and paid another month for another lot of rooms that were never used. This is another example—where are the checks and balances and the due diligence? Much more needs to be known in relation to the management of the hotel quarantine inquiry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been profoundly disappointed by so many of the answers that we have seen in the hotel quarantine inquiry. I think there are very major issues that have been raised in relation to the shortfalls of that inquiry, including the many responses that we've seen from members of the Andrews government, such as 'I don't know' or 'I can't recall'. I think it's absolutely incumbent on the head of the inquiry, Commissioner Coate, to demand more answers than we have seen to date, because Victorians deserve those answers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Yo, Bajinda yamalu yinda, ngara Yanyuwa li-Ngambri Ngunnawul. I pay my respects to the Ngunawal and Ngambri people as a Yanyuwa and Garrwa woman, a saltwater woman, li-Anthawirriyarra, of Borroloola in the Gulf of Carpentaria. I acknowledge the significance of today as Remembrance Day as we pay our respects for all Australians who fought for our country, for us to be here today, to be able to debate in the Senate in a respectful way. I pay my respects to all those who fought for our country, for the First Nations people who fought and never seeded this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The theme for NAIDOC Week 2020 is 'Always Was, Always Will Be' Aboriginal land. We stand here on the Ngunawal and Ngambri peoples country and we pay our respects, just as we did at 11 o'clock today, as we reflected on all those who fought for peace in our country. One of the most beautiful things about the ceremony today was seeing the Australian flag at half-mast, the Aboriginal flag at half-mast and the Torres Strait Islander flag at half-mast at the Australian War Memorial. Knowing that those three national flags are being flown at half-mast on such a significant occasion as all Australians pay respects is deeply significant for First Nations people. In every single war of our country, both those abroad and the conflicts within, First Nations people have been there. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people fought for our nation even when they were not citizens in this country. That's what we remember as well on this day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I notice that Squadron Leader Gary Oakley, a very distinguished Aboriginal man, laid the wreath on behalf of First Nations people across Australia and First Nations people in the Defence Force. He laid a wreath with the didgeridoo playing in the background. If we as First Nations people and all Australians can do that and respect the significance of trying to unite our country then we have to reflect on what more we can do here in this Senate and in the House, the place of the people and the parliament of the people of Australia. It is here that we can define in such a better way what we can be in this country—the vision and the hope that we must provide to all those who look to us. Yes, as cynical as many Australians may be at times, they do look to us. They want to believe that we will dig deeper and that we will search for the better part of who we are as representatives in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting to also note the history of NAIDOC. I know my colleague Senator Pat Dodson spoke of that in his speech here this morning. It was in December 1972 that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs was established. For many decades Aboriginal and Islander people had wanted to be recognised for the sadness, the struggles and the fact we hadn't ceded land in this country—from the 1930s with Mr Cooper and the struggles through the Aboriginal Progressive Association through to 1972 when the Department of Aboriginal Affairs was set up under the Whitlam government. Two years after that NADOC—the National Aborigines Day Observance Committee—was officially established. It was the first time they had all Aboriginal people on that committee. Goodness knows what the committee looked like before that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of years later NADOC became part of ATSIC, which took on the role of caretaker for NADOC. NADOC was always about keeping the struggle alive, always about reminding our country of the unfinished business. In the 1990s when Islander people were included it became NAIDOC, the National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee. We call it NAIDOC. I'm not sure many Australians would understand that history, but it's a significant story to know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When ATSIC was disbanded what happened to NAIDOC? It floated. What happened to the committee? It floated. At various stages it became a committee of sorts with different people. They carried our country and our people through the many changes of government policy that's saw ATSIC abolished. So what happened to NAIDOC? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this moment I'd also like to acknowledge the First Nations senators who have stood here. It began with Senator Neville Bonner and then there was Senator Aden Ridgeway; Senator Nova Peris; Senator Lidia Thorpe, who has just joined us; Senator Jacqui Lambie; Senator Dodson; and me. We hold the significance of the journey and story of our country through whatever ideological areas or party we stand for. I don't think there's any taking away from the fact that we bring our country, our culture and our kin right here into this Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was Senator Aden Ridgeway who was the acting chair of NAIDOC while it was still working out what to do. Eventually, from Aden Ridgeway, it went to the NAIDOC co-chairs. And I'd like to acknowledge Anne Martin and Ben Mitchell, the NAIDOC co-chairs from 2008 to 2018, who kept holding the flame for our country, promoting respect for First Nations people in our schools, in our education system, in the songs and stories in every state and territory jurisdiction. It was Anne Martin and Ben Mitchell who co-chaired the national committee and encouraged each state and territory jurisdiction to have its own state and territory NAIDOC committee. Pat Thompson and John Paul Janke, or JP, are our current co-chairs of the national NAIDOC committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, after realising that we'd lost the vote here in the Senate, they sent out a very important reminder to senators and to members in the House that we need to fly these flags. People say they're symbolism, but guess what? So is today, so is this beautiful poppy that I have pinned over my heart. We don't diss symbols. We have to bring them together. We can chew and walk at the same time. We can have symbols and we can have practical changes. Institutions can systemically change for the better for our country in a way that can unite us so much greater than even we could ever have believed. The NAIDOC committees across the country are asking this parliament to reconsider. Symbolism is just as important as the practical issues we have to deal with. It is about unity and it is about bringing our country together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflect on where I come from as a Yanyuwa-Garrwa woman. Yes, we have those issues. We have the issues of closing the gap, which we still need to do, but we also have the issue of being far generous of spirit and far gracious. This Senate can do that; this parliament can do that. You have the people around here who can guide us all through that. On this NAIDOC Day—'Always Was, Always Will Be' Aboriginal land—let's do this together.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McGRATH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  In the brief time that I have available, I'd like to acknowledge the service that John McVeigh gave to the Commonwealth parliament, thank him and his family for the service they gave to Toowoomba and the broader Darling Downs and wish him and Anita the best for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge that the LNP has a brilliant candidate in Garth Hamilton, who is flying the flag of freedom for the LNP in the upcoming Groom by-election on 28 November. Garth is someone who was raised by his family. His dad was a concreter, and Garth spent his childhood helping pour driveways. He was so fascinated by building things that he went to the University of Queensland, where he became an engineer, and then went overseas to help build things. He's come back to Australia and he wants to help build things in Queensland and Australia. He wants to help finish build the inland rail, which, after 100 years, is going to be built by this government. He's going to help build a better Australia.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, on 28 November, I encourage everybody in Toowoomba to make sure they vote for Garth Hamilton—someone who is going to deliver for Groom and is going to deliver for Queensland, someone who is a fighter, someone who is going to put his experience into making sure that the Liberal National Party and this government are a party and a government that do things for Queensland, like dams and roads. Because guess what—the Labor government in Queensland won't be doing it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The government believes it's appropriate for the Australian national flag to be flown in this chamber. As you said, Senator McCarthy, in relation to the remarks that Senator Boswell made at the time, that is our national symbol. It is the national flag, and, Senator McCarthy—through you, Mr President—that remains the government's position.</span>

So it is the case that they are flown inside of this building. That was not what yesterday's motion related to; it was specific to inside of this chamber. In relation to our national flags, indeed there are, I think, five recognised national flags across Australia. We do, in terms of the citizenship test, set an importance on understanding a number of different aspects of Australian society, including the recognition of those flags.</span>

Regional and rural Australia has no greater friends than those in the Liberal-National government. Our government has stood by rural and regional Australia through its most difficult times. That is because we know that a sustainable, economic recovery from COVID-19 depends on so many of those in rural and regional Australia, which is already home to one in three Australians. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on this side of the chamber, the government's side, are committed to ensuring that we put in place the right policy framework to ensure that our regions are able to thrive. Why? Because, as we know, when you support our regions, when you support our rural communities, you are supporting so much more than that. You are supporting the small-business people that live there, that work there and that support the local football club. But, more than that, you create jobs for other rural and regional Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, as a government, have put in place so many policies to ensure major job creation in the regions. These include our City Deals, our Regional Deals, the Regional Growth Fund and, of course, the Building Better Regions Fund. But we also have put in place a number of employment programs, in particular to create opportunities for young Australians to go to rural and regional Australia, but also to help our farmers access workers and support training opportunities. Harvest Trail Services connects workers with growers in all harvest areas across Australia. We also have a Local Jobs Program and Regional Employment Trials. They place employment facilitators on the ground in 25 regions across Australia. They connect people in regional and rural Australia.</span>

But we are supporting them with policies that will get people into work, that will support businesses to prosper and grow and that will support businesses to bring on that new apprentice or trainee. In fact, over 20,000 regional and rural small businesses are benefiting from our supporting apprentices and trainees wage subsidy. Senator McKenzie, $227 million in funding is now keeping around 34,000 apprentices and trainees in work on the job in our regions. We've also obviously got our JobKeeper policy and the cash flow boost. We're also providing $4.7 million for regional small businesses to access free financial counselling, because, obviously, that is just so important for them to navigate through COVID-19. We also have announced over $960 million of initiatives through the relief and recovery fund. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

With all of those industries, they don't just impact on rural and regional Australia; they impact on the whole of Australia. Also, when you look at our food, rural and regional Australians produce our nation's valuable exports. They grow our food and they supply our energy. We will continue to back rural and regional Australians every step of the way because, as you know, when they prosper and grow they create more jobs for Australians. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families and Social Services and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:10</span>):  I thank Senator Polley very much for her question, because it's obviously a very important issue this week. I'll make a couple of points before I go to the direct question that you asked, Senator Polley. First of all, the decision that has been made by the Morrison government, that was announced yesterday by me and the Prime Minister, related to the extension of temporary measures. I would point out that when a government spends $3.2 billion you can hardly refer to that as a cut. So $3.2 billion of additional funding will be made available to Australians in the first three months of 2021 to continue to provide elevated levels of support for people, particularly those people that have been hardest hit by the COVID pandemic. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like the opportunity to advise the chamber that not only has the coronavirus supplement been extended, again—it was extended on 25 September—it will be, again, extended on 1 January for a further three months. But there are a number of other very important measures. I know Senator Siewert will probably understand the importance of some of these other measures; whereas, perhaps, you are not particularly interested, on the other side. By extending the eligibility criteria, many, many more Australians who otherwise would previously not have been able to get access to payment currently are being able to get access to payment.</span>

There will be a positive impact, for an additional $3.2 billion is being made available to Australians in the first three months of 2021. You cannot characterise an increase in spending of $3.2 billion as a cut and, equally, you cannot suggest that there is going to be a negative impact on the economy of additional spending of $3.2 billion.

But what I would say is the reason that the government has made the decision to extend the coronavirus supplement post 1 January is because we recognise that, whilst the economy is showing signs of recovery—in fact, the Reserve Bank governor, Mr Lowe, said last week that the Australian economy was well underway in terms of its economic recovery—it is in its early stages, and that is why we have extended the supplement. It is why we have extended the expanded measures to allow extra people to be able to get the payment—people who are self-employed, people who are sole traders, people who are caring for somebody who may have coronavirus or may have it themselves, people who've been stood down. We are waiving waiting periods. We've continued elevated levels for people on partner income. To couch it in any other term is disingenuous. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

However, what I can say to Senator Siewert is that we still remain very much in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Nobody knows where this is going to end or when it's going to end. I don't think any of us have got a crystal ball. We've only got to look at what happened in Victoria in July. Almost overnight the Australian economy, which had been doing fabulously well to that stage, both economically and in its health response, was plunged back into a level of crisis in one of our states, Victoria. And we saw the devastating consequences that has had on the Victorian community, on the Victorian economy and obviously to the health, the livelihoods and the tragic loss of life that we have seen in Victoria during that time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, if you look overseas at the moment, there has been absolute devastation wreaked in many countries in the Northern Hemisphere by the acceleration of the spread of this particular virus. So we know we're in the midst of a pandemic, and right now this government is absolutely focused on continuing to provide the types of additional supports that we have promised and we have delivered right from the start of this pandemic. We said that we would stand side by side with Australians who were most impacted by the pandemic, and we've done that through a myriad of measures—through measures that Senator Cash has put in place, measures that Minister Hunt has put in place and measures that I have had responsibility for putting in place. We will continue to respond to the health and economic conditions to make sure that we provide additional supports while we see how this pandemic plays out. So, right now, Senator Siewert, I remain absolutely committed to looking at the economic and health conditions that are before us and making decisions in relation to the welfare, budget and the welfare policy that I administer to make sure that we continue to support Australians through this pandemic.</span>

In some circumstances the superannuation may be considered in the liquid asset test. However, I would actually point out to this chamber that the fundamental basis of our welfare system has never changed. It remains the same today as it has always been—we are very consistent—and that is that the Australian welfare system expects Australians to rely on and draw down their own resources before they ask the taxpayers of Australia to support them. The taxpayers of Australia, I could probably speak for them, are more than happy to help other Australians, but the basic and fundamental premise that people support themselves first has never changed.</span>

The Morrison-McCormack government remains absolutely committed to improving mobile phone coverage in rural and regional areas of Australia. Mobile phone coverage, as those on this side of the chamber absolutely get, is vital to people living, working and also travelling across regional and remote Australia. That's why this government has committed $380 million in our Mobile Black Spot Program. The first five rounds of the program have generated in private, government and community investment, $836 million, which is funded over 1,200 mobile base stations right across our nation. Of that, over 880 of these base stations have been activated, delivering real benefits now to regional and rural communities right across our nation. Today, there are 580 Telstra base stations that have enabled over 44,000 triple 0 emergency calls. </span>

Our record stands in the starkest possible contrast to the record of those opposite who did not build a single black spot tower in their six years in government. Only a Morrison and McCormack government can deliver improved connectivity for regional and rural Australians.</span>

This package is further strengthening the resilience of regional and remote telecommunications through mobile network hardening and more temporary deployable infrastructure. NBN Co has already delivered the first Road Muster truck, along with the first satellite fly-away kit. Nationally, over 150 mobile sites funded through the first five rounds of the Mobile Black Spot Program are in bushfire prone or affected areas. Of these, 114 sites have already been built, which I am sure those opposite will be grateful to know. At Howes Valley, a new base station was switched on in January of this year. In March another station begins operation at McCullys Gap. These targeted investments are helping regional communities to better deal with emergencies— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This includes $120 million to upgrade the Carpentaria Highway in the Northern Territory, a road on which I've driven; $38 million for the Cape York community access road from Cooktown to Weipa, a road on which I've driven; $20.6 million for the Great Northern Highway from Broome to Kununurra, a road I have driven on as well. Furthermore, we've invested a further $124.5 million for mapping mineral resources in two high-potential corridors as part of the Exploring for the Future program.

In fact, the Morrison-McCormack government is working tirelessly to create and to deliver jobs and economic development for people living in northern Australia. The fund has been designed to fill the gap where projects would not be delivered if they relied on traditional sources of funding. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility has now committed $2.4 billion of the $5 billion war chest. Of the $2.4 billion, approximately $1.1 billion worth of projects have now reached the critical milestone of contractual close between the NAIF and the project proponents. We've adjusted the NAIF's risk appetite and expanded the range of potential projects in which the fund can invest. Our government continues to deliver on its commitments. We're delivering for the people of northern Australia.</span>

Firstly, I can say that we are absolutely committed, as a government, to delivering for northern Australia, and that means economic infrastructure and delivering on economic opportunities for northern Australia. In fact, as of 30 October, the NAIF had made 23 investment decisions: 10 projects in Queensland, six projects in Western Australia and eight projects in the Northern Territory. These projects represent $6.6 billion worth of economic benefits supporting 7,800 jobs. However, the NAIF is being weighed down by the lengthy approval time taken by the ALP governments in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The time it takes for decisions to be made to enable these projects to progress is totally unacceptable. More infrastructure means more jobs, and I would recommend that those opposite lobby their colleagues in those governments to get out of the way. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As I said in this chamber yesterday, the process is independent in the manner in which I, for example, as the minister am not informed of the details of complaints that are made, and that's a crucial part of its independence. I'm only aware of the complaint that was referenced in response to Senator Farrell because the complainant herself chose to make the matter public via the media. That underlines and underscores the independence and impartiality of the process. In terms of officials elected to this place, as Senator Waters is well aware, the standards, privileges and procedures in relation to elected officials are unique. It is important that we ensure that there is a process for complaints to be heard and investigated and for assistance to be offered to the individuals concerned through not just those processes but also other processes.</span>

The Australian Human Rights Commission has conducted a national inquiry into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces. More than six months later, the Morrison government has still not responded. Why is a man described as 'deeply sexist and misogynistic' responsible for responding to this landmark report?</span>

Indeed, he apologised for things that were written when he was a university student and acknowledged they are not the type of thing he would write, say or, indeed, hold views relevant to today. I think the Attorney-General addressed those remarks and I have no doubt, as I said yesterday in response to a question on this report, that when it is responded to it will go through all of the proper processes in relation to the preparation of a government response, and that will involve the engagement of the Office for Women, in Senator Payne's portfolio, of Safe Work Australia, of the Attorney-General's Department and, indeed, of any other relevant agency in the construct of that response.</span>

The Attorney-General is a skilled officer in terms of his application as Attorney-General. He has worked, in terms of the development of the Commonwealth Integrity Commission—as we yesterday outlined clearly to this chamber—in developing the draft legislation for it, giving detailed consideration to it and seeking to make sure that, in designing that Commonwealth Integrity Commission, we clearly have, in path to legislation, an integrity commission that provides clearly for building upon the various aspects of scrutiny and function right across government at present, ensuring that they operate in a more integrated and effective way, and delivering the appropriate type of oversight to them and additional functions to integrity across government.</span>

Minister, I recently travelled to the Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory. The region is certainly buzzing with activity. It is definitely an exciting time to be a Territorian. The Beetaloo presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity for job creation and economic growth. Can the minister update the Senate on the Morrison-McCormack government's plan to develop new untapped gas resources, like the Beetaloo Basin, which will fuel new manufacturing ventures across the Northern Territory and help our national economy emerge from COVID-19?</span>

As Senator McMahon knows, the resources and energy sector plays a critical role in creating jobs and investment in regional Australia, particularly in her home territory of the Northern Territory. The sector has always been a key pillar of Australia's economic prosperity. It is one of the largest employers and it employs the highest proportion of Indigenous Australians—3.8 per cent compared to 1.7 per cent for all other industries. The sector will also be crucial for Australia's recovery from the COVID pandemic. Recent figures have confirmed the strength of the sector. It generated $290 billion in exports in 2019-20, despite the very challenging operating environment we all found ourselves in over the last year. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is absolutely committed to working with the sector to bring on the next wave of investment in new oil and gas developments. In fact, the Prime Minister said very recently, 'Central to our agenda is getting access to our domestic gas supplies.' We're absolutely committed to remaining a top LNG gas exporter and that's why we are investing in a gas-fired recovery as part of our JobMaker plan. Our investment of $52.9 million in the 2020-21 budget focuses on three very specific key areas of the gas supply chain: $10.9 million for the Gas Infrastructure Plan; $28.3 million for five strategic basin plans to unlock new gas potential, starting with the Beetaloo Basin; and $13.7 million to extend the CSIRO's Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance. We want affordable gas for manufacturers, businesses and households. We want Australian gas to work for all Australians.</span>

The actions taken by our government have assisted in lowering gas prices and ensuring supply to manufacturers, industry and households. We're a government that delivers on our commitments.</span>

Unfortunately, not everyone in this parliament has the same commitment to that development. Labor claim they support jobs in the resources sector, but the party is completely divided on that. It's more interested in inner city votes and jobs than in the economic development of rural and regional Australia, an area that I know, Senator McMahon, you are absolutely passionate about supporting.</span>

When I followed up during estimates, the minister asked to correct the record and said, 'I used the word "announcement"; I should have used the word "measure".' Can the minister confirm that in her answer provided on 7 October she was wrong and that the budget measure was in fact a reannouncement? Why did the minister fail to return to the Senate to correct the record at her earliest opportunity?</span>

I said 'announcement'; correctly, it was a measure. I am quite happy to accept the fact that it was a measure. In fact, the measures that were in the budget—there were two measures that were contained in the budget that were first-time funded in the budget—relate to the funding for 1800RESPECT and also an extension of the Help is Here campaign. Senator McAllister, I am quite happy to stand here and acknowledge that the statement that I provided to you in the budget estimates that we were in together a couple of weeks ago—</span>

In response to a question from you in this place I incorrectly referred to a measure as an announcement. It was a new measure in the budget. It had previously been announced as a budget measure. It is not unusual for budget measures that you preannounce them. In fact, there are many, many budget measures that are preannounced, and you would have done the same thing when you were in government. I accept I made that statement to you. I did use the word 'announcement' when I should have used the word 'measure', but there were new measures in the budget. There were measures, as I said, in relation to the 1800RESPECT number, which is a tremendously important hotline that women who are the victims of domestic violence can contact to find out where they may be able to receive help should they find themselves the victims of domestic violence. Equally, the Help is Here campaign provides women with similar advice.</span>

In addition to that, in an immediate response to the COVID pandemic, when we were concerned we would see an uptick in domestic violence against women and their children, we made an announcement of $150 million. We provided almost all of that money directly to frontline services provided by the states and territories so that they were in a position to immediately respond to an increase in domestic violence, should it occur within their jurisdiction. I can assure you: I know about expenditure in domestic violence, because this government— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The recent events of terrorism in both Paris and Vienna were shocking. The Morrison government is committed to ensuring we do not see similar violence enacted here in Australia. Our first priority is to keep the community safe from those who wish to do us harm. We may be in the middle of a global pandemic but the threat of terrorism remains in Australia, as it does in other places around the world.</span>

There have been 116 people charged as a result of counterterrorism operations. There are currently 22 people before the courts for terrorism related offences.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To respond to this threat, the coalition government has passed 20 tranches of legislation. This legislation includes: to create a presumption against bail and parole for persons who have demonstrated support for or links to terrorist activity; to enable the continued detention of high-risk terrorists and strengthen control orders to minimise the threat to the Australian public; and to establish the temporary exclusion order scheme, which gives law enforcement and security agencies greater control and certainty in managing Australians of interest returning to Australia, including foreign fighters. We have also invested, as a government, more than $61 million to support programs to counter violent extremism. Our laws and arrangements focus on threat and criminality, regardless of ideology. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Additionally, Australia is advocating to deepen international norms and support the development of common industry standards to counter terrorist and violent extremist content online.

The recent budget that the Morrison government handed down prepares Australian law enforcement agencies to deal with terrorist and criminal threats in order to keep Australians safe. This year alone, the government has invested $8.2 billion across the Home Affairs portfolio. The budget is also providing an additional $300 million over four years to enhance the AFP's search capacity and ability to respond to emerging threats, including terrorist threats. This investment is designed to defeat all of those who are involved in activities that most Australians actually don't know anything about—the underworld, the dark web and the networks that these criminal syndicates operate to do us harm and to seek profit at the expense of Australian citizens. This builds on last year's budget— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Birmingham) and the Minister for Families and Social Services (Senator Ruston) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I doubt that the Prime Minister wanted to spend this week talking about the accusations that were aired in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Corners</span> report on Monday night or in the papers today. In political life, however, you only have control over a certain number of things. You do not control the issues you face, but you do control how you respond. The Prime Minister had a choice: to stand up and exercise moral authority or to crouch down and try and duck the issue; to be big or to be small. In his press conference yesterday, the Prime Minister, sadly, chose the latter. The Prime Minister's comments sought to minimise and downplay the stories that have been told about the actions of ministers in his government. We heard that these were examples of 'human frailty', that we are all accountable for our own behaviour. What we didn't hear was a recognition of the bravery of the women who spoke up or a recognition of the importance of the parliament being a safe environment for everyone who works here or a recognition of our capacity to improve the culture of this place. The Prime Minister suggested that these were all matters from the past and so there was nothing further required from him. Yet can anyone believe that the issues about puerile back-stabbing from male party members raised by Liberal women in the WhatsApp group are in the past? I note that only last month other prominent Liberals were again calling for the Liberals to account for their failure to pre-select women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a chance to show leadership. To date, the Prime Minister has not taken up that chance. No-one can pretend that poor behaviour is exclusively the preserve of members of one party. But the examples that are in the public conversation today relate to the Prime Minister's own party. That gives the Prime Minister even more capacity to exercise moral authority, to listen to women and to recognise the harm caused by cultures of bullying, harassment or sexism. Those cultures diminish the institutions that we are all here to protect. The Prime Minister has been willing to speak on accusations of improper conduct made against members of other parties or coalition partners. The greater test is how willing he is to respond to accusations made against those in his own party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliament has an opportunity to work in a bipartisan way to make this workplace better. No matter what side of politics you are on, we can surely agree that staff working here should feel safe and supported. The accusations of bullying that have been made today add to existing complaints about culture that have been put on the record in recent years by Liberal women, and they are serious complaints. If we want this parliament to truly embody the democratic ideals that I believe every senator in this place seeks to uphold then this parliament must be a place where women can work and contribute free from discrimination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women's work should be valued on its own terms. Women should not be assessed on how they look or how they behave; it is their contribution at work that should matter. In considering the issues that have been raised, I believe we need to retain focus on women and their right to participate fully in this place. There are other issues that have been raised over the course the week: adherence to family values, the potential for compromise or blackmail and the reputation of the office. These are relevant factors, but we cannot lose sight of the core obligation that we hold to the women who work here. Everyone deserves a safe workplace. This should be the primary matter of concern. We owe it to ourselves, to this institution and to the people we represent to work together to ensure that that is how this place operates.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  I rise to take note of this matter. I'm incredibly proud to be part of a party that has sent four female senators out of five senators to the ministry. I'm proud of that because we have been preselected and elected on the basis of being the best people for the job, not on any other attributes. So when we talk about safety and workplace condition standards, I quite agree that they should be applied to all in the workplace and that they are not applicable just to women or just to men; they are applicable to all people who work in all workplaces. We are all responsible in a way, whether it be as men who hold positions of responsibility or, indeed, as women who hold positions of responsibility. Building a culture that enables us to all enjoy where we are and enables us to contribute in a fulsome way is important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the Prime Minister has been very clear on this matter. He has a very strong ministerial staff code of conduct, and he holds both his ministers and all staff in this place to that high standard. The Prime Minister said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is important that everyone should feel safe in their workplace. That everyone should have proper channels through which they can deal with any issue about which they are uncomfortable. I think that is incredibly important. I think the change in ministerial standards introduced by my predecessor were important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">What is important is there are standards and the standards are adhered to and under my administration, under my government, I take that code very seriously and my ministers are in no doubt about what my expectations are of them, absolutely no doubt, about my expectations, and I expect them to be lived up to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue that we are talking about is setting standards, setting a code of conduct and moving forward in that spirit. To have matters raised and discussed in this place and have it act like a kangaroo court is a very dangerous place to be and one that I'm sure no man or woman would like to see—that is, our reputations and actions being examined without due process and consideration. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to see comments from Senator Boswell around the Australian flag and the introduction of that into this Senate. It is incredibly important that we unite in our agreement of what it is that unifies us, what brings us together. The Australian flag as the official flag of this country is an important element of that. Others, which were referred to by Senator McCarthy, are symbols—whether it be the symbol of the poppy that we wear today for Remembrance Day or symbols of other flags. Whether they be the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flag or state flags, they are all important flags, but it is the Australian flag, the official flag, that flies over this parliament and in the House of Representatives and this Senate chamber. It is important to find those things that unify us, those things that we can unite underneath, particularly at this time when people are searching for safety and security, for some sense of certainty in the world, when we are faced with a pandemic that is both a health crisis and an economic crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with much pride that I reflect on Senator Boswell's comments. He is, again, somebody from the National Party who has provided much leadership and thought around issues that are important to regional and rural Australia. He has not been well of late, and I'm very pleased to see that he is making a terrific recovery. He has provided many years of incredible service and distinction to the party, to the Senate and to the country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Ruston this afternoon. Senator Ruston papers over the incredibly difficult situation that jobseekers in Australia find themselves in with now yet another cut to the coronavirus supplement. It's been reduced, again—from $500 to $250 to now $150 a fortnight, another cut of $100. Yet still this government does not commit to a permanent increase to the JobSeeker payment, which, for a long time, has been seen as manifestly inadequate and way below the poverty line. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister also failed in the question to even acknowledge the prediction that there will be 1.8 million people reliant on JobSeeker by Christmas. That figure is currently at about 1.7 million; therefore, we can see that it is set to rise. Perhaps more telling is the minister's failure to acknowledge the absolutely disproportionate ratio of the number of unemployed people and underemployed people in our nation compared to the number of jobs available. The minister simply said, 'Oh well, it's too hard; there are too many different ways of measuring it.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However you measure it, the outcome is bad. There are about 1.7 million people in Australia seeking more work. There are about 926,000 totally unemployed people. The ratio of unemployed people to vacancies, therefore, looks to be about one vacancy for every eight people. If you look at the feedback from people who are applying  for entry level jobs, the ratio is much worse. There was one example of a woman who applied for a job in retail to find that she was competing with 790 other applicants. These are extraordinary statistics, by any measure at all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look to other measures, it's worse for young people. It's much worse for young people. They are subject to much higher levels of unemployment, where you can't get a job as a young person because there are more than eight young people for every vacancy. Let's have a look at where we've come in this regard. In January, <span style="font-style:italic;">Business Insider </span>had the statistics of three unemployed people for every one job. In October, they had it as five unemployed people for every single job. But what <span style="font-style:italic;">Business Insider</span> doesn't do is look at the real unemployment rate. When the government says the unemployment rate is higher or lower, it doesn't count people who are doing some work. So, in those October figures from <span style="font-style:italic;">Business Insider</span>, it's five people for every one job. But we know that the levels of unemployment are actually much higher, because there are 1.8 million people who are looking for more work in our nation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  Can I deal with the matters which were raised by Senator McAllister. I have a very high regard for Senator McAllister, and I'm not going to question the sincerity with which she raised her matters today. But let me say this. As someone who, in a previous life, before coming to this place had professional responsibility for investigating claims of sexual harassment or bullying in the workplace, and who was responsible for enforcing codes of conduct and dealing with extraordinarily delicate issues, I am firmly of the view—firmly of the view—that such matters should not, in the first instance, be ventilated in the public domain and certainly not on television. I am firmly of the view that appropriate procedures of investigation and serious responses raised in pursuit of complaints should occur, in the first instance, in private. I say this primarily due to the issue of respect. It is respect for the complainant, it is respect for the person who is subject to the complaint and it is respect for their families, for their children and for everyone close to them. These can be extraordinarily delicate matters—they are, typically, highly personal—and have complicated backgrounds. I think it diminishes this place for those matters to be canvassed prior to an appropriate investigation taking place. It shows a lack of respect for the individuals involved, it shows a lack of respect for their families and it shows a lack of respect for due process. I say that as someone who believes passionately that all individuals have a right to a safe workplace where they are free of sexual harassment, workplace bullying and discrimination. In the event that matters are raised privately and have not been given sufficient serious attention—but only after such processes have occurred—then, I think, relevant parties have a right to blow the whistle, to raise issues and to say: 'I raised a complaint behind closed doors. I'm not happy with the seriousness with which it was investigated, and, on that basis, I'm elevating it in good faith.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen some episodes in corporate Australia recently where aggrieved complainants have taken those steps of going public and blowing the whistle and there have been consequences for some leaders in corporate Australia as a result of that whistle having been blown. In my view, it was entirely fit and proper that that whistle was blown and that those consequences flowed from the complaints, which were not adequately or appropriately dealt with. But I think it is incumbent upon all of us to respect due process and to respect the legitimate expectation of everyone involved in such personal matters that their rights, including to privacy, will be dealt with respectfully and with sober deliberation so that, where possible, matters can be considered in private and confidentially, giving respect to all parties involved, including their families and their children. I think that is what we should all aspire to.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  I rise to take note of Minister Birmingham's answer to my question on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags. Within the numerous questions and supplementary questions that I asked, one of the things I noticed was the question around the Australian citizenship test, which includes a section on Australia's flags—the Australian flag, the Aboriginal flag and the Torres Strait Islander flag. There really did not appear to be a substantial response to that. I think it is very curious that people who move to Australia and sit this citizenship test have pointed out to them the importance of these flags, not just the Australian flag but the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags. I spoke about it earlier today on this most sacred day, Remembrance Day, when we stop at 11 o'clock to remember those who fought for our country. I spoke about the importance of First Nations Black Diggers, as they're called, not only in terms of the marches on Anzac Day but also in terms of the work of the Australian War Memorial and its recognition. I must point out that that was under the previous director, Dr Brendan Nelson. I commend the work that he's done, along with others who've worked there, such as Squadron Leader Gary Oakley, who worked at the Australian War Memorial as an Indigenous liaison officer. I commend the importance of that institution reconciling the significance of First Nations soldiers—men and women—who have defended Australia over centuries not just externally in terms of other countries but also internally with the frontier wars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Symbolism is important. The question in the citizenship test about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags shows that this government obviously sees it as important. The minister was asked about the Liberal governments in New South Wales, Tasmania and, soon, South Australia flying the Aboriginal flag in their parliaments and whether he would, especially this week, reconsider the motion that was before the Senate in relation to that symbol of respect for First Nations people. That motion was put to the Senate in August. It's not something that came up just because of NAIDOC Week. It was prolonged and that resulted in it being put forward in NAIDOC Week simply because we were being respectful and urging the government to have the dialogue and the discussion. Instead, the prolonging of it clearly meant that it was not a priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to point out that the minister didn't respond to the question about whether the motion would or could be reconsidered here in the Senate, even though the Liberal parliaments in New South Wales, Tasmania and, soon, South Australia will be flying the Aboriginal flag in their parliaments. I think that's really telling, especially as this is the federal parliament, the parliament of the Australian people. If ever there were an opportunity to say, 'Maybe we need to reconsider this,' then it would be this week in particular, NAIDOC Week. It would be an incredibly generous and gracious thing for this Senate to do. It would send the right message of unity—bringing First Nations people and non-Indigenous people together over something as symbolic and sacred as the Aboriginal flag and the Torres Strait Islander flag.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Pat Dodson said, there are 44 flags flying out the front and most of them are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags. I think that's a really beautiful thing. I certainly call on the Senate and the minister, who didn't answer the supplementary questions, to reconsider putting back to the Senate, and supporting, the motion to fly the First Nations' flags.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we go again. The government are refusing to commit to not dropping the JobSeeker payment back to $40 a day. They know that that payment is too low. They know that because they very sensibly put in place the coronavirus supplement as people started to lose their work earlier this year. They knew that people couldn't survive on it and they knew that families couldn't survive on it, so they increased it. But now they're slowly taking away supports before the pandemic and the impact of the pandemic are over. While we're in a recession they're cutting away those supports and going back to their old way of doing business, which is to demonise and punish those who can't find work, despite the fact that, for every one job vacancy, there are 12 people looking for a job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They would not commit to the fact that they won't drop it back to $40 a day. The minister trotted out the usual tropes and the usual comments: 'People get a whole range of other payments.' The point is that, even with those other payments, people are living below the poverty line. The main payment the majority of people on income support get is the energy supplement of a grand $4 a week. Well, that doesn't even buy you a cup of coffee—not that you can afford a cup of coffee if you're living on that!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I did a quick check of the rents as they are at the moment in Perth. Perth isn't the city with the highest median rent. In Perth, rent is $395 a week. At most, if you're getting Commonwealth rent assistance, which about only half of the people on income support get, you get $185 a week. So you can see that that's nowhere near enough to actually cover the cost of rent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Polley asked a question around the reduction in the value of the coronavirus supplement come the end of December to $150 a fortnight. There's no justification for how the government came to that level of funding. There was apparently no consideration of the fact that, come January, people will be living further below the poverty line. If you're lucky, you might get some level of rent assistance, but, if you're one of the majority, you'll get your extra $4 a week, which still puts you significantly below the poverty line. There is no way we are out of the woods yet, in terms of employment. We know the government's own figures are predicting that there will be 1.8 million people unemployed. This country already has around three million people living below the poverty line. You would have thought that the government would realise that it's much better to have people coming out of the recovery with enough money in their pocket to feed themselves, to provide for the services and supports needed to overcome the barriers to employment. As I've said on many occasions, the government doesn't seem to be paying attention: poverty is a barrier to employment. The government keeps running out the line that there are plenty of jobs out there. There are not plenty of jobs out there and certainly not for the people that I'm hearing from, from across Australia. They are trying to find work but they can't find work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my supplementaries was about whether, for people who have accessed their super, that is part of the liquid assets that count towards the liquid asset waiting period. And, yes, it is. I got an email just yesterday from a small business asking for help. Unfortunately, that small business hasn't been going real well during the coronavirus period and the pandemic, so that person has had to reapply for JobSeeker. That person had, in fact, got themselves off the payment to run their little business, but, unfortunately, he's not able to make ends meet and has had to reapply for JobSeeker. And guess what's happened? Because that person accessed the only bit of superannuation that they had, they aren't able to go back on the JobSeeker payment as he has a little bit of cash. Instead of the government supporting that person, that person now has to run down their only bit of superannuation, which they've drawn down to try and make their life better. What does this lot do? They make him wait. Not only have they stuffed up the application process by not getting back to this person; they're also now making them wait until the day before Christmas before they can go onto the JobSeeker payment, forcing them to wear down their superannuation payment. That is a farcical, ridiculous situation. Then, when that person does actually get onto the JobSeeker payment, they'll get the much reduced coronavirus supplement of $100 a fortnight.</span>

                  </a>  The government notes the tragic deaths of Mr Fredy and Mr Chen and extends its condolences to their families during this difficult time. However, the government notes that the Commonwealth, states and territories are each responsible for implementing, regulating and enforcing work health and safety laws in their jurisdictions. Consequently, whether these were workplace deaths and whether this notion encourages a certain treatment of these matters are ultimately questions for the New South Wales regulator, SafeWork NSW and the New South Wales police.</span>

                  </a>  The Greens support this motion and we express our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of Dede Fredy and Xiaojun Chen. They died at work in a gig economy, which overwhelmingly means insecure work, low pay and utterly diminished industrial rights for workers. Three-quarters of delivery riders earn below the minimum wage. Many gig economy workers are migrants and on temporary visas and are vulnerable to exploitation and wage theft. Our employment laws don't protect workers. They put protecting corporations and their profits ahead of the rights of all workers to be safe at work and treated fairly. We must close the loopholes that allow companies to exploit and endanger gig economy workers. Every worker has the right to come home safe from their workplace.</span>

                  </a>  The Greens will be supporting this motion. The Australian Greens opposed this inquiry from the outset. We did so because it was an unwarranted attack on the science underpinning the reef regulations. It was an attack on the dedicated scientists doing the critical work of protecting our reef from the twin threats of the climate emergency and poor water quality. It was an unnecessary diversion of time and resources to continue this government's war on science, rather than supporting the communities who depend on a healthy reef. Our concerns were borne out in the public hearings, as some committee members dismissed expert views and ignored, cherry-picked or wilfully misunderstood the evidence. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, the majority of the committee expressed its confidence in the high-quality science underpinning reef management policies, but the aggressively misguided views of some senators undermine community action. Australia has stewardship responsibility for the iconic World Heritage listed reef. The government must not only support our world-class scientific institutions; it must call out uninformed views, act on expert advice— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  While agreeing with part (b), One Nation opposes this motion. I was present on the day and sitting beside Senator Rennick—and proud to be so. Firstly, I commend Senator Rennick for assisting me and others at the inquiry to expose the dodgy science from academics who do not deserve the title 'scientist'. I commend Senator Rennick for his patience in putting up with some academics dodging his questions. Secondly, Professor Ian Chubb and Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg in the past have misrepresented the science. Indeed, on another matter some years ago, Professor Hoegh-Guldberg reportedly made public statements contradicting his own research. In my experience, neither is a reliable witness. Thirdly, Labor senators, including former senator Doug Cameron, Senator Kim Carr and others, can be frightfully intimidating. So I respectfully suggest that Senator Green get her own party in order before calling into question the conduct of people doing their best to expose what is now proven to be a scam. The evidence we found is highly embarrassing for the Palaszczuk government because we unearthed the fact that there is no scientific evidence— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  It is quite extraordinary that the government has denied formality on a motion in support of Taiwan, a vibrant democracy and indeed an important trading partner for Australia. This motion is largely based on the words that came from AUSMIN and it just reaffirms Australia's view that any resolution of differences between China and Taiwan must be peaceful. It's a shame that the Senate won't be able to stand and support Taiwan—42 million people who are under some threat from increased rhetoric and increased incursions into Taiwanese waters and air space by Chinese military aircraft.</span>

                  </a>  The Australian government remains committed to its One China policy and does not take a position on Taiwan's future status. Stable and constructive cross-strait relations serve the interests of all parties. Australia calls for a peaceful resolution that does not involve the use or threat of force or coercion, consistent with its focus on security, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. It has been our longstanding policy position to support Taiwan's meaningful inclusion in all international organisations where the requirement for statehood does not preclude involvement, including the World Health Organization. We continue to value Taiwan as an important economic partner for Australia, as our seventh-largest goods export market in 2019. But, as a longstanding tradition, we deny formality on complex matters of foreign policy.</span>

                  </a>  This motion says everything about this government. In fact, I would suggest that it was probably drafted in the Prime Minister's office. What is masquerading as a motion to acknowledge Victoria and support Victoria is actually about sticking the political knife into the Victorian government and attacking them. This is exactly how this government have behaved through this pandemic. On the one hand they say, 'We're all in this together and we're all working as a nation', and then, at the first opportunity, they start picking people off, state by state, where it doesn't politically suit them. We are not in a position to support this motion because of that. I note, for example, it doesn't include the more than 685 people who have died in aged care while this government was asleep. Where's that in this motion? Absolutely nowhere!</span>

In contrast, the Great Reset is a very modest World Economic Forum initiative aiming for cooperation amongst global stakeholders to manage the direct consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. One Nation is criticising it in response to COVID-19 because, they say, it would negatively impact on our economic wellbeing and individual freedoms, but the truth is that, unless we take this pandemic seriously and cooperate globally, dying of coronavirus actually has a much more serious impact on our individual and economic freedoms.</span>

Climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution. That is why the Paris Agreement aims to achieve global net zero in the second half of the century. As a signatory, Australia is committed to that goal and, as the PM has said, we want to achieve that goal as soon as possible.</span>

By avoiding robust scientific evidence to support policies, politicians are able to base policies on their political and ideological whims and vested interests. As we recently learned, the CSIRO, which advises the government on climate science, has been caught out relying on discredited scientific papers and unvalidated models as the basis for advice to government on climate policy.</span>

I remind the Senate that this is day 419 since I first challenged the Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate to provide the evidence and to debate me, and 7 October marks a decade since I first challenged her to debate me, and she has not fronted after immediately refusing.</span>

                    </a>  On 19 October 2020 the Minister for Defence made a public interest immunity claim in response to general business notice of motion No. 786. The claim was made on the grounds that provision of the requested document would harm the Commonwealth's ability to achieve value for money, negotiate ARC arrangements and meet Australia's broader strategic objectives. Commercial-in-confidence and national interest issues are the grounds for public interest immunity and have been recognised by successive governments. The government affirms the public interest immunity claim made by the minister.</span>

I went through a process to get access to it—it was a lengthy process—and eventually the Information Commissioner ordered that the document be handed over. It then went to appeal in the AAT. An agreement was reached to stop wasting time, but here is the document that is being denied to the Senate. I have it in full; it has been provided to me for the purposes of—</span>

Congratulations to my colleague Michael Berkman on his re-election in Maiwar and to my new colleague Amy MacMahon for winning the seat of South Brisbane. Both seats were won with huge primary votes, because more people than ever voted for a Greens MP. We saw strong swings to the Greens across Brisbane and we largely held our vote across Queensland. This election is a win for a science and health led response to a global crisis, with Labor and the Greens increasing margins and picking up extra seats. </span>

And that was before COVID. Queensland is now an economic basket case, and still the Premier and her government offer no coherent plan for recovery. If the Labor Party are so worried that the Greens would 'do great economic damage to Queensland at a time when every job is vital'—and, by the way, I agree—then it beggars belief that Labor continues to preference the Greens. Let's also remember that Labor relies on Greens preferences.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  I present the Delegated Legislation Monitor No. 12 of 2020 and move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I wish to draw the Senate's attention to two instruments in chapter 1 of the monitor which raise significant technical scrutiny concerns. The first instrument is the Fair Work Amendment (Variation of Enterprise Agreements No. 2) Regulations 2020. This instrument repeals changes that were made to reduce the access period for a proposed variation of an enterprise agreement from seven days to one day. In the monitor, the committee reports its view that the explanatory statement to the instrument does not currently comply with certain technical requirements of the Legislation Act 2003, particularly the requirement that explanatory statements must contain a description of any consultation undertaken in relation to the instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In correspondence with the committee, the Attorney-General has provided the committee with details of the consultation that was undertaken in relation to the instrument and the measures that it repealed; however, the Attorney has so far declined to update the explanatory statement to the instrument to include this information to ensure that it complies with the Legislation Act. The Attorney has instead noted that details of the consultation that has been undertaken are already on the public record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has significant scrutiny concerns about this noncompliance with the mandatory requirements of the Legislation Act. In light of these concerns, the committee is seeking the Attorney's advice as to why the explanatory statement to the instrument cannot be amended to include the information he has provided with regard to consultation. As the committee retains significant scrutiny concerns in relation to the instrument, the committee has resolved not to withdraw its notice of motion to disallow the instrument, in order to provide the Senate and the committee with additional time to consider the instrument. The response provided by the Attorney to the committee's request for further advice will inform the committee's consideration of whether to withdraw the disallowance notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second instrument I wish to highlight is the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment (Threshold Test) Regulations 2020. This instrument amends the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Regulation 2015 to set the monetary thresholds for particular significant actions and notifiable actions to nil. In effect, this means that the majority of actions relating to the acquisition of interests in Australian business or land require notification to the Treasurer under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975. This measure aims to safeguard the national interest during the COVID-19 pandemic. The committee considers that this instrument implements a significant COVID-19 response measure and should therefore be time limited. Despite this, neither the explanatory statement nor the instrument itself specifies a date by which the measures will end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the significance of the measures, the committee asked the Treasurer to amend the instrument to specify a date by which the measures will cease. The committee also gave notice of a motion to disallow the instrument on 1 September 2020. The Treasurer has since advised that regulations have been made to reinstate the monetary thresholds where a foreign person is renewing a lease over non-sensitive commercial property. In addition, the Treasurer advised that exposure draft regulations have been released which would reinstate the monetary thresholds for other actions from 1 January 2021. On the basis of the Treasurer's advice, which confirms an intention that the measure be time limited, the committee has resolved to conclude its examination of the instrument and withdraw the notice of motion to disallow the instrument.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to take note of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Regulation of auditing in Australia</span> report. I'll put the headline up-front: the committee has delivered a final report in addition to its interim report, which was tabled in February. In the intervening period, not much has changed about auditing but everything has changed about our economy, and that reflects the concluding comments that the committee has made today and will be tabled today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, the committee stands by all 10 recommendations which were made in our interim report in February 2020. Those recommendations were made on a bipartisan basis in a unanimous report encompassing all members of the committee. I take the opportunity to place on the record my appreciation for all members of the committee who worked together in a collegiate way on this issue and in this interim report and now final report and, in particular, the deputy chair, Mr Georganas, and Senator O'Neill, who initially referred this inquiry through this chamber to the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our interim report in February found that although there were widespread concerns among stakeholders about the quality of audit in Australia there wasn't good evidence available to the committee, hard empirical evidence, that there was a systemic problem with audit in Australia. What we did identify was a perception about the problem of audit quality in Australia. Many stakeholders, whether they were shareholders or academics or industry associations or other groups, believed that there were perception issues in the industry that needed to be addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We made 10 recommendations. Some were aimed at the industry, some were aimed at the regulator ASIC, others were aimed at the financial FRC and others were aimed at government in order to address those perception issues. We believe that if those recommendations are faithfully implemented by all those bodies then the reputation of the audit industry in this country will be enhanced and greater confidence will be restored to the industry, because the confidence that investors are able to place into the financial statements made by companies is a crucial part of a free market economy. It allows the efficient allocation of capital. It allows the trust in markets that are essential to this industry, and auditors have a crucial part to play in that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our concluding comments tabled today, we stand by all 10 of those recommendations. I won't go through all of them individually and I won't go through them in detail, but there were some which have attracted particular interest and particular comment. Our seventh recommendation in our interim report was to implement a mandatory audit tendering regime, which would require company boards after a 10-year period of using one auditor to either engage in a tender process to potentially choose a new auditor or, if they didn't wish to do so or didn't believe that it was necessary to do so, to explain that decision to their shareholders. That could be in the form of a note in their annual report or another means whereby they demonstrated to their shareholders that they had thought about this issue and they had decided they wanted to stick with their current auditor for whatever reason.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are good reasons why you might wish to keep an auditor for longer than 10 years. Having an auditor for a long period of time allows them to develop a familiarity and an understanding of your business. It's typical that in the first few years of an audit enormous resources have to be expended to get to understand a company and its operations and that over time the audit process becomes both more efficient and more effective. However, the longer period of time that a company is audited by the same auditor, the greater the risk that the independence of the auditor is compromised and, perhaps in some ways more importantly, the greater the risk of a perception that that auditor's independence has been compromised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen a few high-profile companies and auditors who have been in audit relationships for many decades. In fact, there was one celebrated case, I think it was 67 years, where the same audit firm audited a company for that time. Of course, the audit committee chair on the board of the company that was audited would have changed many times in those 67 years. The chief financial officer in that company would have changed many times in those 67 years, and the lead audit partner in the audit firm would have changed many times in those 67 years. Nonetheless, it sent a message to the regulated community, to the audience for those audit reports, that a cosy relationship may have been established, and that has undermined confidence in the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What that recommendation is asking companies to do is to either undertake a tender every 10 years or to demonstrate to their shareholders why they don't believe that's necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some have said that a 10-year period is too short, and it would absolutely have been up to the committee to recommend a different period—it could have been 12 years or 15 years. I don't think there's anything hard and fast about the 10-year rule, but it is important that some sort of process is put in place here to demonstrate that boards understand that their relationship with their auditor should not be set and forget and that they should not allow the perception to form among their shareholders or other stakeholders that it has become set and forget. They should demonstrate that they're considering this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another recommendation that has attracted some comment and interest is recommendation 9, which is about establishing internal controls for financial reporting. It has been put to the committee that there would be costs involved in implementing this recommendation, which is undoubtedly true, and that in some instances and for some businesses this may not be necessary—for example, a family owned business where the family is both the management of the company and the owner of the company. Who would they be assuring except themselves? That is a good and fair point. It is also true that, even in larger businesses, there would definitely be transition costs in implementing this recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee understand that, and, in light of the changed economic climate that we're in, our recommendation is that government consider all of the recommendations, but, in particular, recommendation 9, on the basis of, firstly, the time lines for implementation—we should consider very carefully the appropriate time lines—and, secondly, the thresholds for implementation. At which level is it appropriate, whether that is by revenue or by some other measure, to implement them? We urge the government to carefully consider that, because at the moment, quite rightly, businesses and their partners—whether their auditors or other service providers—are solely focused on trying to save their businesses, to save as many jobs as possible and to grow on the other side of this crisis. The committee certainly does not want to distract them from that important task or to impose costs on them at a time when they're focused on that task. They absolutely should be focused on that crucial task. But we believe that, with appropriate time lines and by appropriately staggering the implementation of these recommendations, all 10 could be adopted—and adopted successfully—both on the audit side and on the company side, to enhance the reputation and quality of audit in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just conclude by revisiting one of the recommendations in the interim report which most attracted my interest and enthusiasm, and that was recommendation 10, about the introduction of digital reporting. I believe there are huge gains for auditors, for the businesses that they audit and also for other market participants from digitising our financial reporting. It is amazing to me, as I discovered through this inquiry, that in 2020 there are still companies and auditors who engage in a fairly manual process of data entry to extract data from companies for the purposes of financial reporting—that it isn't automated and that it isn't more efficient. Other jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United States, have successfully implemented digital financial reporting. It has lowered the cost of audits and lowered the costs for other market participants in assessing the quality of audits. And it allows much more independent third-party verification of those numbers. It allows those numbers to be used in a lot of other ways that enhance the confidence that all market participants have in this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is little more to add to the concluding comments, which are relatively brief, except to say that, compared to February, when the interim report was handed down, we are in a different world. Certainly, the committee recognises that. It hasn't changed the substance of any of the recommendations that we have made but it does change the posture, I guess, that we've taken on this. Our final recommendation to government in the concluding comments is that the government should carefully consider both appropriate time lines and thresholds for the implementation of these recommendations, taking into consideration the new and very different economic climate that we're now in, thanks to COVID-19, and of course the necessary government responses to COVID-19, which have had an enormous impact on our economy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  I rise today to speak about the final report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into the regulation of auditing in Australia. This is a landmark report, and it offers a timely, bipartisan and credible road map to ensure our auditing industry is accountable, transparent and appropriately regulated. I'm reminded every time I turn a page of this report—and, indeed, by the concluding remarks that have been tabled here—that this inquiry was desperately needed and that the issues the inquiry uncovered needed to be seen in the clear light of day. I'm also reminded of the high-stakes nature of this issue. If the audit concerns revealed by this inquiry remain unresolved, they could shake our already rocky economy to its core.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Auditing underpins the stock market and the economy and, with more and more Australians depending on superannuation to provide for their retirement, the quality of audit is a matter that materially effects the financial wellbeing of every Australian and their family. The big firms that Australia knows—PwC, KPMG, EY and Deloitte—are at the core of the auditing profession. This report is about what we found when we investigated them, and other entities in the field as well, over the course of most of 2018. This inquiry exposed what journalist Adele Ferguson rightly described as an 'opaque and conflicted industry'. ASIC, although under a cloud at this time, has been vocal over years in calling for an investigation into the quality of audit due to escalating concern following their annual reviews revealing that audit quality was dropping.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The elaborate and systemic exploitation of ordinary Australians by major financial institutions revealed in the Hayne royal commission into banking was a wake-up call to many of us that something was deeply wrong in so many areas of our financial services industry. The conflicts of interests between the consultancy and the auditing businesses of many of Australia's largest professional firms deeply troubled me in that context. The evidence put on the public record in the course of this inquiry about how terribly corrupting financial incentives can be for far too many people and businesses, especially the biggest banks and corporates in the country, is not of the same scale in the audit industry, but we need to be mindful of the power of financial incentives to corrupt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report is an achievement. It's an achievement for my colleagues on the committee, who listened to many hours of evidence, read dozens of submissions and contributed in ways big and small. It is an achievement also for all the whistleblowers who bravely stood up and revealed practices and attitudes in the major Australian auditing companies that compromise any commonly understood definition of ethical business behaviour, integrity and professional audit scepticism. Their insight and generosity in sharing their knowledge with me on behalf of their fellow citizens marks them out as genuine servants of our democracy. Truth must be told. Companies that don't hear internal whistleblowers are short-sighted. I hope that more civic-minded Australians see that their truth-telling to parliament can make a profound difference that benefits millions of us. I thank them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I personally ran into some strong headwinds when I initially moved to establish this inquiry. Indeed, I had to advance it and put it to a vote on the floor of the Senate. I'm happy to say it was carried that day on the voices, but I thank Senator Whish-Wilson and his team, Senator Lambie, Senator Griff, Senator Hanson, Senator Patrick and Senator Roberts for their commitment to supporting my motion, which enabled this committee to do its work. Without their initial support, I don't think the work of the committee that's been reported today would have been undertaken at all. I particularly thank my Labor colleagues, my own wonderful staff and the committee staff for their vital role in bringing forward this report. I also thank the chair of our committee, Senator James Paterson, and the other Liberal members of the committee for their endeavours as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once the direction of the Senate for establishment of the committee was achieved, Senator Paterson approached the inquiry with a calm and steady hand during all of our hearings, private meetings and other deliberations, always happy to reach across the aisle when in the interests of the nation. It's a credit to Senator Paterson that he's worked carefully and collaboratively throughout this inquiry. I listened to his contribution this afternoon and I accord with him in his assessment of where we are. I note in particular his comments around the necessary changes to the implementation of recommendations 7 and 9, which are impacted by practical realities at this time. The report goes out under Senator Paterson's signature, and I hope he will be just as zealous as I will be in ensuring that the recommendations in this report are taken seriously by this government and that implementation occurs as soon as is practicable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's fair to say there were significant variations of practices by each of the big four, but the report reveals the necessity of the inquiry, the need to reform outdated and potentially dangerous conflicts of interest, the need to establish more oversight of the practices in the profession and the need to change the perverse and reckless behaviour that we saw in some of the big auditing firms.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry also found a deeply troubling culture at many of the auditing giants, including evidence of ineffective management of conflicts of interest. I also received in-confidence reports of sexual harassment across the entire sector. It also uncovered that Westpac's anticrime provisions were inadequate and that the board, having known about that failure for years, should have acted much sooner on the reports provided by their auditors. Westpac was subsequently investigated by AUSTRAC over 23 million breaches of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remain concerned about the use of the CPS 220 reports, which are provided by auditors, about perceived and real conflicts of interest which auditors determine by their own reckoning. Their professional right to undertake work as both an internal auditor and an external provider of assurance services was something I simply couldn't believe they were saying on the record. There might be some technical alchemy of magic words that, with a wand and some swift hand movements, can be employed to continue to justify such practices, but decent, straight-talking Australians know what the word 'independent' really means. You can't be an outsider and an insider at the same time. It's time the sector accepted that fact and fixed the problem, and changed the perceptions as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report has some key recommendations that I would like to speak to briefly: recommendations 3, 4 and 5. In my view, they go to the heart of why I brought this inquiry to bear. I was worried that auditors were too close to their clients and that information barriers declared in internal policy documents were in fact non-existent or severely compromised by lax consideration. It became clear that auditors were auditing their own firm's work. That is just beyond the pale. It cannot happen—not if we're going to have the integrity of financial reporting that we need in this country. I remain concerned, despite denials, that audits are being employed in some instances as loss leaders for far more lucrative consulting work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pandemic has shown that we cannot always take for granted that traditions will hold and that inertia and ennui will carry us safely into the future. We need to ensure that ethical practices and culture are not only assumed to be in place but also subject to critical review and, where necessary, regulated and carefully overseen. In Australia, we cannot risk an Enron style auditing failure, and this inquiry, I believe, has brought us back from the brink. Our economic prosperity cannot be rebuilt on falsehoods, on foundations made of sand, and an unreformed and unrepentant auditing industry will put all we seek to achieve here at risk. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the report to the Senate and I give very strong voice to encouraging the government to get on with the job. I know that Senator Paterson will be sharing in my delight as it is implemented. I think we'll all get the benefit of that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="256063" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  It's a really great pleasure to rise to speak to the PJC on Corporations and Financial Services' final report on the regulation of auditing, which of course follows the interim report. I started my career, for better or worse, as an internal auditor at Ernst &amp; Young and got some good skills for life there. Learning how a risk and control framework can do great things for an entity is a good skill. I would say in relation to this inquiry—which, as Senator O'Neill reminded the chamber, was initially referred by her to the committee chaired by my colleague Senator Paterson—that this report has landed 10 quite good recommendations, which are bipartisan and, I think, really could improve the quality of auditing in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly, there is a sense in some quarters that there is too close a proximity between auditors and audit clients, and perhaps this is a consequence of there being these four large auditing firms and then a second tier of much smaller audit organisations. I would say from my own experience of working mainly in internal auditing that there were certainly instances where their proximity was too close and there were audit partners that I don't think had the independence required to perform an external or internal audit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These recommendations, which appear in the interim report and have been endorsed in this final report that's being tabled by my colleague Senator Paterson today, are effectively a way to shore up and improve the existing system. My reading of these recommendations is that they are designed to ensure that there is more confidence in the system. I'll look at a few of these recommendations in detail. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 4 deals with the question of a more detailed declaration. That does address the comment I made about where an external auditor providing advisory services to an entity can give rise to a conflict of interest. In many cases, there's been a price war to win the auditing contract. That is almost a bit of a loss leader. Advisory services are where the audit firm or the professional services firm can make a considerable amount of money—which is all good; I have no problem with people making money. But the audit function is so important to our corporate governance structure in Australia that, where there are conflicts, where there are misaligned incentives, they really ought to be stamped out, given the importance of having an audit that reflects the true and fair position of a company's financial accounts. Just as important, I would say, is the role that internal auditors play. I don't just say that as a former internal auditor. Genuinely, there is a greater appreciation of the importance of having a proper risk and control framework. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great disappointments in the last few weeks has been that the corporate regulator has failed to comply with its own risk and control framework. The corporate regulator appeared at Senate estimates two weeks ago, I think it was. It's very embarrassing that the corporate regulator has a risk and control framework, has a control on remuneration, and was unable to comply with that control. That sends a very bad signal. It shows how important it is that internal auditing—a lot of this is about professional services firms winning the contract for the external auditing and providing advisory services which then distort or conflict with the sort of audit you would expect of a public company. In my time, I saw it happen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 4, which provides more fulsome confidence to the market that there will be a full disclosure of services provided, is an important one. Equally, recommendation 5 gives a safeguard that there are no secret commissions or additional payments happening in the background. Recommendation 6 deals with tenure. I think tenure is very important. I'm not certain there is a case for people to be the audit partner for more than a decade. Generally speaking, 10 years is what the ASX Corporate Governance Council would say is a period in which someone can be an independent director on a company board, and after 10 years they lose the right to call themselves independent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">APRA has said that it should be, I think, eight years for people to be on a superannuation board. Like many things APRA does, this has not been enforced. In fact, there are people who are currently sitting on superannuation boards who have been on a board for 26 or 27 years. I'm 36 years of age. That's a long time. That's a good deal—27 years on a board. I do think that tenure is important. If all the other transparency arrangements are in place and the market can make a judgement about the capacity and the appropriateness of a long-term audit tenure, then I think that is okay. The question is: what about the individuals? I think that's what recommendation 6 really asks the government and, ultimately, the parliament or its delegated authorities to put more detail around.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other recommendation that I want to touch on in the time that I have remaining is recommendation 9. It is a good reminder of how important the control frameworks are and that anything we can do to improve confidence in these control frameworks so that, when people invest in a public company, whether it's a large or small public company, they feel that the accounts are a true and fair position and there is no funny business going on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, recommendation 10—I'm always interested in all things digital. We have a problem in this country of still doing too many things on paper. The Corporations Act, which was written in 2001, still requires paper delivery of documents and doesn't provide for technology neutrality. This has been a real drag on our productivity and efficiency. I've had many representations from listed companies that have had to chase around small retail shareholders at their last known address for seven years after they were last able to contact them, and send them, effectively, phonebook style correspondence for seven years. We have a plan to try and digitise and modernise the Corporations Act, or many of its provisions. In future, the more that we can provide for technology neutral delivery in a digital age, the more it will enhance our productivity and efficiency. Certainly, the next time we write a Corporations Act we should provide for that form of technology neutrality. I understand that some people will always want to have paper documents and when you have retail shareholders who want a particular form of paperwork there should be a protection so that can be supplied. But, in the main, my sense is that digital accounts will be the way to go and that recommendation 10 is another good contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate everyone who was involved with this committee report, particularly Senator O'Neill and Senator Paterson.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will end the inequality faced by separating de facto couples in Western Australia for the past 10 years, by allowing them to split their superannuation as part of a family law property settlement. It will also allow WA de facto couples to have bankruptcy matters heard concurrently with their family law proceeding, avoiding the need to pursue them as separate proceedings in two different courts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These important measures will provide greater access to justice for WA de facto couples by providing fairer and faster resolution of their disputes. The Bill will mean WA de facto couples will be able to achieve a fair split of their superannuation assets as part of a property settlement, while also saving them valuable time and money in resolving bankruptcy and family law disputes together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In doing so the Bill will bring WA de facto couples in line with other de facto and married couples across Australia, ensuring they are treated in the same way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">Superannuation splitting</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Between 2003 and 2010 all states, other than WA, provided the Commonwealth with a full subject matter referral of powers for all de facto financial matters, including superannuation. Since these referrals were given effect, all de facto couples, except for those in WA, have been able to split their superannuation interests following the breakdown of their relationship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2006, WA provided a narrow referral of power to the Commonwealth for de facto superannuation splitting only. Previous governments have not accepted this narrow referral because it did not extend to other de facto financial matters - the allocation of property interests more broadly, and spousal maintenance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It has become clear that the inability for de facto couples in WA to split their superannuation is resulting in inequitable property settlements in some cases. This is because the court has to try and offset the value of the superannuation with other assets of the relationship, like a house or savings. This is not always possible, particularly for couples with large mortgages, or few other assets between them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Superannuation is an increasingly valuable asset for Australians, and can be the largest single asset in the property pool of a separating family. Being unable to split this important asset disproportionately affects women, who accumulate less superannuation, on average, than men. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure de facto couples in Western Australia, like other de facto couples across Australia, can achieve a fair split of their superannuation in property settlements, the Morrison Government agreed in 2018 to accept the narrow referral of power, and end the disadvantage faced by WA de facto couples. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The narrow referral is implemented through Schedule 1 of the Bill, which will create a new Part VIIIC in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Family Law Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">1975 </span>(Cth), dealing solely with superannuation splitting for separating de facto couples in WA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This new Part largely replicates the existing superannuation splitting provisions and definitions that apply to married and de facto couples in other states and territories, which are located in Part VIIIB of the Family Law Act. Having the provisions in a single Part of the Act will make it simpler and easier for judges, lawyers, and separating de facto couples in WA to find and use the new regime. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Bill, de facto couples will be able to split their superannuation by court order, or by an agreement made between them. The Bill provides that any financial agreement relating to a couples' superannuation interests will form part of a broader financial agreement made under the relevant WA law, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Family Court Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">1997</span> (WA). This will ensure that de facto couples only need to make one agreement which covers their superannuation interests and other property, such as their house. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill provides that appeals with respect to superannuation interests of de facto couples will lie to the Supreme Court of Western Australia, ensuring that de facto couples have a single appeal pathway for their family law property disputes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The nature of the narrow referral of power means that all other aspects of property division for separated WA de facto couples will continue to be dealt with under WA law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also end the disadvantage faced by WA de facto couples in resolving family law matters where either or both parties are also involved in bankruptcy proceedings. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, WA de facto couples need to resolve these matters through separate proceedings in two different courts: family law proceedings in the Family Court of Western Australia, and bankruptcy proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Circuit Court of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 of the Bill will extend federal bankruptcy jurisdiction to the Family Court of Western Australia, which will allow bankruptcy and family law matters of de facto couples to be heard concurrently in a single court. This will avoid the need for couples to commence proceedings in two different courts, saving them valuable time and money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 of the Bill largely mirrors existing provisions of the Bankruptcy Act that provide the Family Court of Australia with jurisdiction in bankruptcy when a party to a family law proceeding is a bankrupt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also provides that appeals in relation to concurrent family law and bankruptcy proceedings for WA de facto couples will mirror existing appeals pathways for married and de facto couples in other jurisdictions. To achieve that consistency, appeals will lie to the Full Court of the Federal Court where the bankruptcy matter originates in the Federal Court or Federal Circuit Court and is subsequently transferred to the Family Court of Western Australia. These proceedings generally involve complicated questions of bankruptcy law and are best considered by the specialist bankruptcy court, the Federal Court. Matters that originate in the Family Court of Western Australia will be appealed to the Supreme Court of Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ability to have bankruptcy and family law matters heard together will bring de facto couples in line with married couples in WA, and with married and de facto couples in the other states and territories. The Bill will therefore provide for a nationally consistent approach to the exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction in concurrent bankruptcy and family law matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The remaining schedules in the Bill outline the required consequential amendments to other Commonwealth Acts, along with the application and transitional provisions, necessary to support the smooth implementation of this important new regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reforms in this Bill will play a vital role in ending disadvantage for WA de facto couples and their families. By enabling these couples to split their superannuation, and to commence concurrent family law and bankruptcy matters in the same court, the Bill will help WA de facto couples resolve their disputes in a fairer, faster and simpler way. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  I seek to debate the motion before the chair, before the question is put, and say that the Senate should insist on its amendments to this bill. This bill requires the transparency that has been put forward by the Senate in this legislation, such as the quarterly reports and the protection for workers that this place has seen as valid and important to be in the JobMaker legislation. It's all very well for the government to try to slate blame on this place for, indeed, wanting to put reasonable legislative amendments in place, but it is on the government's head if this legislation doesn't proceed today because it has not seen fit to agree to these extremely reasonable amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments simply put forward the idea and put into the new rules that there needs to be transparency so that we can see properly that the JobMaker hiring credit scheme is working and that we can also ensure that workers aren't worse off under this legislation. It is critical that the Senate stand up for itself and say to the government, 'What we've put forward is absolutely and entirely reasonable.' The government has the opportunity to get on with this legislation, because in the Labor Party we have, unlike the crossbench, expressed our support for this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what the Senate has resolved is that the legislation, if it were to proceed—and this we have in common, irrespective of whether there are senators here who don't want to see the legislation proceed at all—needs to be amended in this transparent way. So it is entirely up to the government to say, 'Look, what the Senate has asked for is entirely reasonable; it's not difficult to do.' In fact, the government hasn't even finished drafting rules for this legislation—the delegated legislation inside it. The fact that the Senate expresses some opinion about what should be in those rules is not a difficult thing. It is an entirely reasonable thing. The drafting of the rules can be done in a way that is entirely consistent with what the Senate has asked for.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  The Greens have a very strong position that the Senate should insist on its amendments to this Economic Recovery Package (JobMaker Hiring Credit) Amendment Bill 2020. We've been here for the last two days debating the JobMaker hiring credit scheme which, in the legislation, is no scheme at all. There have been members who have stood up—many members over the last two days—and spoken about the bill. And many on this side have expressed their deep concerns about the bill and the implications of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens really believe that it is, at the end of the day, a corporate welfare scheme with very little chance, or indeed no promise, of creating good, secure, well-paying jobs. We have expressed our concerns that the bill does nothing to prevent the wage subsidy from being used to bolster corporate profits, because we know that many businesses which will be eligible for the scheme have made profits during the pandemic. They have given millions of dollars of dividends to their shareholders through the public purse. They have paid their executives bonuses using public money. We know that there is nothing in this bill preventing wage thieves, for instance, from not having their eligibility revoked—and we know the history of many of the big corporations which have really been exploiting and underpaying their workers. This bill doesn't provide a dispute resolution process. This leaves workers who have their hours reduced or even lose their jobs really exposed. And we know that none of the regulations are in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On all these issues we have moved amendments, to make sure that this bill, in some way, shape or form, is improved. Although I'm very disappointed that the Greens amendments on these issues haven't been supported by the majority of the Senate, I have to accept that that's the way it is. But there have been amendments that the Senate has approved and passed. One of those is a very crucial amendment that I moved on behalf of the Greens. It makes sure that there are safeguards for workers and makes sure that there are protections for existing workers, to ensure that they do not lose hours of work or their jobs so that businesses which fiddle their books can hire workers who might be eligible for the credit. New jobs should not come at the expense of existing jobs and workers must be protected. We know who the workers will be that will go. It will be older workers. With the way this legislation stands now, companies can easily get rid of those older workers to make way for other workers who they will get a benefit for through the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We note that the Senate accepted an amendment about creating transparency and reporting on what happens. The government in the House of Representatives did not accept the Senate's will. That's in a way really subverting what the Senate said. We won't let that happen. It shouldn't be allowed to happen. We have been here discussing and debating. The will of the Senate should stand. This bill should be accepted in the way that it was amended. We are here right now making sure that that will happen.</span>

The amendment also protects the ordinary working hours of existing workers. It makes sure that their hours are not reduced to make way for the minimum 20 hours of work those eligible for the credit must do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims it has headcount and payroll protections in place; however, these are not adequate and will not stop businesses from rorting the scheme in order to take advantage of the subsidy. We have to enshrine protections for workers in law because the government's track record on protecting workers shows that they cannot be trusted and that the draft rules are insufficient. We need to stand up for workers and make sure that this bill does not allow unscrupulous companies to fire existing workers in order to turn around and hire workers who are eligible for the hiring credit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is particularly important for workers in my home state of Tasmania. The labour force data from September this year shows that there are 252,000 people employed in Tasmania. This amendment will protect those workers from being fired so that businesses can replace them with workers eligible for the credit. This amendment will also protect those Tasmanian workers from having their hours cut so that businesses can turn around and give those hours to workers eligible for the credit so that they meet the 20-hour criteria. The unemployment rate in my home state of Tasmania is 7.6 per cent. That is obviously too high. This amendment will stop that rate going up, by ensuring existing Tasmanian workers retain their jobs.</span>

The fact that the government has refused to accept the amendments and is asking the Senate to not insist on them without an explanation really begs the question: why is the government opposed to amendments that stop employers from being able to sack existing workers? I think that is the question that the government needs to answer here. It is very instructive, and I guess we shouldn't be surprised by this, because the government never works collaboratively with the chambers. When it's convenient the government works collaboratively with the Senate, but not this time. The Senate has expressed its view in these amendments, the amendments were returned to the House and the government has said no. There was no engagement, no explanation, no justification for why relatively minor but important amendments could not be agreed to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a lot of issues with the JobMaker hiring credit scheme. I think JobMaker was announced in June, when the employment department knew nothing about it. JobMaker existed for about 4½ months before any detail was released. Some detail was provided in the budget, and at that time the government claimed that the hiring credit scheme would create 450,000 jobs. In estimates we found out that the Treasury view is that only about 10 per cent, or 45,000, of those jobs will be created. We have concerns about this scheme. We are in a deep recession. We have nearly a million unemployed people. We will have 160,000 extra people in the unemployment queues by Christmas, and the queues are already long. We have seven jobseekers for every job ad. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This hiring credit scheme may do some good for young workers, and that is why we have supported the scheme, albeit with concerns. Those concerns go to issues like job security, the fact that the scheme is pretty modest and the fact that government has no answer for what it will do for unemployed workers over the age of 35. The Restart scheme has been a failure in terms of the government's own targets. Despite having concerns about the scheme, in the same spirit of bipartisanship with which we have engaged in tackling the pandemic, we have been prepared to work with the government and support proposals, even if they weren't perfect. We worked with the government on JobKeeper. We called for a wage subsidy scheme weeks before the government finally agreed to one. When the scheme was introduced, it excluded a lot of workers and now the government is reducing the payment way too soon, in our view. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will support the JobMaker hiring credit scheme, but we think that protections should be put in place to protect existing workers against rogue employers. Frankly, it's been months since the JobMaker scheme was announced. The government has had enough time to put in place sensible legislation, but it hasn't been able to do so. We have half-baked legislation, with rules being written on the side but not released until quite late. We are prepared to work with the government, and that's why these amendments exist. The amendments specifically offer some protections for existing workers, so that rogue employers cannot churn through employees. Rogue employers will be prevented from sacking existing workers and bringing on other workers. We think these amendments offer the necessary protections that should be in the legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also an amendment concerning transparency, so that this government, which we know likes a fair bit of secrecy and refuses to provide information, can report on how this scheme is going. Those are the reasons that we believe these amendments should be supported. We will be insisting on the amendments. We wish the government would work more collaboratively when the Senate expresses its views on things like this, instead of making a flat rejection without any explanation. These amendments are about protecting working people. We want people to keep their jobs and we want the government to create new jobs, but we don't want a scheme with loopholes and room for rogue employers to manoeuvre to force existing employees out of work just so these employers can access the scheme. It's up to the government to explain why it finds these amendments offensive. If the government finds these amendments offensive, it obviously has no problem with the lack of job security in this country and the ability of some employers who are not eligible for this scheme to lay off people and bring on others. That is our major concern and it remains our major concern. We wish the government shared this concern.</span>

We know this government has no respect for workers' rights, but this is rich even for them. This Senate did its job. We are not a rubber stamp. We did the job of amending this bill to put in place protections for existing workers so that they can't be sacked by an employer who can then hire someone else and get the benefit of a subsidy. So much for JobMaker! It's why this scheme has been called 'JobFaker'. This government won't even come at that basic protection for existing workers. Now, as we've all been standing here for the last 15, 20-odd minutes, we see that it looks as though Pauline Hanson's One Nation has joined with the government to sell out older workers, to remove the protections that this chamber put in place to ensure that people can't be sacked. I hope that their voters are paying close attention, and I hope that the voters for the government are paying close attention. Conventional wisdom has it that older voters might tend towards the conservative side of politics. Well, you've just sold out your own constituency!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate is not a rubber stamp. We are here to amend laws, to scrutinise them and to improve them where we can. We did that job yesterday, and you folk cannot even come at a small amendment to protect workers from getting the sack so that your corporate mates can get free taxpayer money to hire two other people on insecure and precarious contract arrangements. This is a very low day for this government. It's a very sad day for older workers in this nation who this chamber protected yesterday. Now this government, with the support of Pauline Hanson's One Nation, is ripping away their protection. I understand those discussions are still underway, and perhaps they'll backflip yet again—I hope so. Older workers deserve protection. We are in a pandemic. It is hard enough as an older worker to find work, let alone keep work. This was a small protection to give them some job security that this government and One Nation are now forcing the parliament to remove. Shame on you!</span>

I'm an eternal optimist, and I live in the hope that they will change their position yet again to their original position of ensuring that workers can get protection. I know you're not meant to say these things out loud, but here I am doing it, and we're on broadcast. This is what's happening: democracy is being sold out.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe we're in the committee stage. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I can ask a question of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I'm really interested to know what offer was made to Pauline Hanson's One Nation in order to secure this backflip, to deliver you her votes and to ensure that you can remove the protections that this Senate gave to older workers from getting the sack. I don't imagine the minister's going to take up my invitation, because they don't actually have to stand up. We can ask them questions, and they can just stay seated. There's no recourse for senators to hold them to account. So we'll see. But I think the public deserves to know what deal was made. What did you offer, and what did they accept for them to do a 180 and sell out older workers? This is our democracy we're talking about. The Senate has a job to do. We are not a rubber stamp. I don't care if I've broken the rules in calling out what's actually going on in here. I would like to know what deal you did with them to get their support and abrogate and abandon older workers. Chair, I seek your clarification. Can I indeed ask the minister questions in this committee stage?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  To avoid any doubt, this is what is going on here in the Senate: Senator Waters has asked a completely legitimate question of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Birmingham. That question is: what secret, dirty deal has been done between the government and Pauline Hanson's One Nation party to sell out workers? What secret dirty deal has been done between the government and One Nation to ensure that companies actually can fire a worker and then turn around and hire other workers to take advantage of the hiring credit?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I referred in my earlier contribution in this debate to workers in Tasmania and the need to protect them. Here is a bit of news for Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts: those arguments apply equally to workers in Queensland. When Senator Waters asked this entirely reasonable question of Senator Birmingham, what did we get from the government? Absolute crickets. That's what we got. The big bagel. We got absolutely zilch out of this minister. This is his first week in the gig and he's squibbing it already. He won't even answer questions. Interestingly, he couldn't even mount an argument when he moved the motion as to why the Senate should not insist on the amendments passed yesterday. So we've had no argument from the government, no restating of a position and no stating of any new position. Again, all we've had is crickets. When Senator Waters got up and asked that incredibly reasonable and sensible question about what backroom deals had been done, all we got was crickets once again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be really clear about what is going on here—a deal stitched up between Pauline Hanson's One Nation and the Liberal and National Party government in this country to do over workers and to look after the interests of the big corporates. That's what's going on here. Once again the interests of those big corporates take precedence over the interests of ordinary Australians. It's no surprise that that is what the Liberal Party would do. They are the agents in this parliament of the corporatocracy. But One Nation pretend that they are the party of the battlers. Yet they turn around and vote with the government to do over workers right around this country. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Birmingham, in your first week on the job, you have a chance to show you take this chamber seriously and you take the role of Leader of the Government in the Senate seriously. Will you please answer the question: what deal has been done with One Nation? What did you offer them in order to induce them over to your side of the chamber when in fact they were saying in here yesterday they wanted this bill defeated utterly?</span>

                    </a>  I'll take that interjection. It's on the record now. He is suggesting that there has been no quid pro quo here at all, no offer or proffer from the government at all, and he is asking this Senate to believe that One Nation have magically and without any inducement from the government gone from saying, 'We hate this bill; we want it killed off completely,' which was their position yesterday, to, 'Oh, okay; we'll facilitate the government's agenda to look after the big corporates today.' That's what Senator Birmingham is asking this chamber to believe. It's on the record now. We will ensure that there is an opportunity for Senator Hanson to confirm or deny that. It's a sad day when the Senate is actually failing to stand up for the very sensible, the very logical and the very necessary amendments that it passed yesterday.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final point I'll make is this: there is absolutely no skin off the government's nose for it to support these amendments. The amendments are sensible. They are logical. They'll protect workers from being exploited. And the government should show maturity, it should be reasonable and it should ensure that the interests of working Australians are protected.</span>

Should the Senate indicate a preparedness today to say that it will insist on these amendments—and I hope it does—I note, with the minister, that the regulations will be in consultation until November 27, so there is no rush today for the government or the Senate to finalise this legislation. There's plenty of time for a message to go back to the other place and for them to consider that what the Senate has asked for is entirely reasonable. Indeed, payments are supposed to start flowing in February—again, there's plenty of time. In terms of the architecture of the regulations that need to be written for this legislation, these are simply some suggestions from the Senate to guide the writing of that legislation. They in no way at all impede the government's ability to progress all of the other regulations and rules that go with this scheme. Minister, please can you confirm for me that the regulations are in consultation until late November?</span>

That is exactly as the government has said and I explained multiple times during the lengthy committee stage on this bill. And, during that committee stage, I responded to the various amendments, a couple of which we are dealing with and reconsidering here.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me, for Senator McKim's and Senator Waters's benefit, restate what I said across the chamber before: no deals have been done. Let me equally restate the important merits of this program, which are to ensure that we have incentives in place to stop young Australians from being on unemployment queues for too long and to help get young Australians into jobs. That's what this is all about. Look at it. We've now got a filibuster, in planned preparation happening across the chamber, from those who seem to want to impede the passage of a program to help young Australians get jobs. That's what this program is all about. I've now heard all manner of arguments put to somehow impede, block, complicate or stall the legislation or create different barriers as to why this program needs changing when, at its heart, it's a program that has clear safety valves in place. You don't get the subsidy unless you are employing more people overall—that is, unless you've increased the headcount of the people in your business. You also don't get the subsidy unless your payroll has increased. So not only do you have to employ more but your payroll has got to have gone up. It's designed to ensure and support additionality of employment to help young people get in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also doesn't supersede in any way, shape or form any of the different measures in relation to how fair work laws work, unfair dismissal laws work or the like, so we have all the existing protections in place. The program is designed to ensure additionality, and businesses ought to have certainty in terms of this legislation passing so they can get on with making decisions. Yes, the rules are out for consultation but, Senator Pratt, in relation to your question, the scheme applies to new hires from 7 October. Businesses can be, should be, making decisions now about putting young Australians into work, yet the actions of the Labor Party and the Greens in seeking to filibuster this are putting doubt in the minds of Australian businesses. That doubt may well mean that a young Australian misses out on getting a job that otherwise could have been there. That's what those opposite are doing: jeopardising the potential employment of young Australians. Shame on them.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  I want to bring to the chamber's attention that we understand there has been a change in position from Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. They will be not supporting these amendments, on this occasion. They will be folding and selling out to back in the Liberal-National government yet again. This has very big consequences for older workers in my state of Queensland, which is the home state of Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts. If you had believed them when they were out there you would have thought Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts had had the interests of older workers in Queensland. Instead, as we could have predicted because we've seen it so many times before, they've rolled over, they've caved in and they've backed in the Liberal-National government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really would have thought that after the most recent Queensland election, where Pauline Hanson's One Nation party was demolished by Queensland voters, they might have learnt something from that. They might have learnt that you pay a price at the ballot box for selling out your voters. What we saw in the lead-up to the Queensland election was Pauline Hanson's One Nation party sell out older voters by demanding, over and over again, that Queensland's borders be opened. If you have a look, as I have done, very closely at who votes for Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, it tend to be older people. Despite that, Pauline Hanson's One Nation party and Senator Hanson herself repeatedly called, through the Queensland election campaign, for Queensland borders to be opened, exposing older people in Queensland to the risk of contracting COVID and dying.</span>

                    </a>  I'm happy to do so. I understand that Senator Hanson is embarrassed about her recent performance in the Queensland election and I understand that she's embarrassed to have it pointed out to her that she has sold out older Queenslanders, again, but why that's relevant here is that it's exactly what she's doing here in this bill. The amendment that Labor succeeded in having passed by the Senate, when the bill was last put here, seeks to protect older workers. It seeks to stop employers from sacking older workers, replacing them with younger workers and then putting their hands out to get a subsidy from this government to help pay for it. This is a measure that is designed solely to protect older workers—the very people who Senator Hanson constantly goes around Queensland saying that she cares about.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as Senator Hanson did in the Queensland election, where she sold out older Queenslanders by demanding the borders be opened, one-and-a-bit weeks since the Queensland election she comes back down again, sells them out again and says that their jobs are expendable, that they should be replaced by younger employees and that she's not going to stand up for them. I'm sorry, Senator Hanson, but if you're prepared to sell out older workers in Queensland, Labor isn't. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're going to stand by older workers in Queensland, and we're going to tell older workers—over and over again—that you've sold them out. Your vote's down to seven per cent in Queensland because you sold out older Queenslanders over COVID and the borders. It'll go down further when they find out that you're selling them out about their jobs. Older workers are concerned about their jobs and job security right now, and Senator Hanson is prepared to trade them off as yet another deal with the Liberal-National government. The reason she does that is that she cannot be trusted. She always votes with the Liberal-National government. She's doing it again, and this time older workers are paying the price. Senator Hanson's going to be held to account for this, and she still has time to reconsider her position.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  The minister said, 'We wanted to make sure there aren't different barriers.' The measures that are being proposed are not barriers; they're actually making sure that people have appropriate opportunities, that workers don't simply get replaced. This is not actually an argument about older and younger workers. Yes, that's part of it, but this is also a situation where younger workers can be replaced by other younger workers. The reason they've going to be replaced is that this government has not put in place obligations not to sack those people. The government are doubling down on a ludicrous situation. The party I'm a member of was going to support the legislation if they were prepared to put into it the appropriate safeguards. It's purely because the Prime Minister got caught this morning on his own incapability to have a bill that works—all show, no go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had a few arguments with Woolworths over the years, in my previous life, and I've made a few comments about them in this chamber as well, but Woolworths, to their credit, have said that they will not replace their workers—their casual, young or older workers—with subsidised workers. They've done that by choice. But their competitors, like Aldi, haven't said that. Quite frankly, if Woolworths' board change their mind because their competition isn't doing it, they'll be able to do it, too, because the government is not agreeing to this amendment. Even the scoundrels that I've called out before, companies like Woolworths, have said they're not going to be scoundrels anymore; they're going to turn around and do the right thing. That's to their credit, their absolute credit. I think it's the first time I've given them credit for anything in this chamber! But the government is letting all their competitors off scot-free, and it will be letting the board of Woolworths off scot-free if they change their minds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we go to the situation with Qantas: 2½ thousand workers replaced. 'Don't worry; we've put great conditions in place,' say the government. It's all show, no go! These 2,500 workers are being outsourced after the government gave $800 million to their employer to keep people connected. What are the government doing? The exact same thing. Do you know what they're going to say? 'We spent hundreds of millions of dollars to give young people jobs.' It's so they can have a one-line answer when people say, 'What the hell did you do with a trillion dollars?' This money will be spent in a way that will see hardworking young people replaced and people over the age of 35 discarded. This government, through its own arrogance—just as we saw from the Prime Minister when he doubled down on the incorrect claims he made earlier this month—does not want to accept that it made a mistake about what this program will look like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do come to this chamber with a bias. I'm a member of the Labor Party and a very proud trade unionist. But that experience also gives me the opportunity to say I've dealt with many fantastic employers, people who did the right thing when they did haven't to. They did it because they believed it was the way they should run a business: fairly and squarely. Those opposite have just opened up a situation in many decent companies I've dealt with where their employees, among them active union members who participate with their employer to make sure their operation is successful, will be undercut by subsidies from this government. They're going to be throwing out our hardworking Australians; that's the reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've taken cases to court for the reinstatement of casuals, on the off-chance not that the judge was going to make a decision but the employer would be embarrassed enough to say, 'Look, we're rethinking what we did.' I've gone through conciliation on the odd occasion it happens. But, I'll tell you what, I've never been up against a wage subsidy from the government to make it happen or for it to continue to happen. This government has made a decision that will undermine the fabric of hardworking jobs in this country. If you work hard then you expect your employer to look after you. They're going to subsidise that out of every employer they can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And let's make it one step clearer: we have seen an avalanche of people moving from permanent to casual work—a lack of job security, a lack of capacity to raise a family or to decide when the bills are going to be paid and how they get paid. And now the government is turbocharging not only the dismissal of many, many workers, young and old—to be replaced—but they're also going to turn around and put in the situation where permanents are also dismissed because the incentive is if you're there for over 20 hours. Let's casualise the workforce—we don't have enough casualisation! We don't have enough job insecurity! We've seen it under their watch, where wages have collapsed. We've seen it under their watch, where permanency has declined. And now we're seeing the worst part of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They've been running the strategic line about how they would deal with the Industrial Relations Act and the many other wage subsidy programs they misdirect. But they're now actually being very barefaced about it. We don't want barriers to people having decent jobs. We don't want to have barriers where the employer can turn around and sack somebody. That's because it's a lie: you can sack people. Everyone knows that the industrial relations system will not protect those casuals. The employers know it, I know it, this chamber knows it and, by hell, I'm sure the government knows it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the situation here—and I'll go back to the great credit to Woolworths and many, many other companies; I know that many companies would fall into this position—where some companies have said, also leading into Christmas and New Year, that this is a time for them to reward their staff when they've done it so tough. They reward their staff because they know that family incomes are based on the wage cycle of that industry—the income of that industry. It's not about going for a holiday, it's actually about paying your bills and making sure that you have insurance, pay your car repayments and pay your rent. People factor that in, and yet this government is now subsidising every competitor with Woolworths to say, 'If you don't do the same thing you'll be competitively disadvantaged, because we're going to put government money in to make sure you get rid of those people'. That's the effect of what this government has proposed.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just had a brief conversation and I would like to place on record that under our existing workplace laws there are no protections from being dismissed unfairly if you have been employed for fewer than 12 months with your employer. Contrary to an opinion that was just expressed, there are no protections for existing workers who have been employed for less than a year with their employer. That's what this amendment seeks to address. This amendment says that the government isn't going to give a boss an incentive to fire those people who they can legally fire; it's not going to incentivise that firing through this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make it crystal clear that the purpose of this amendment is to protect existing workers from being sacked and from being incentivised to be sacked so that an employer can simply hire two additional employees to get the subsidy that this bill would provide them with, in fact on lower hours and with lower wages. The Greens don't think we should be using public money to incentivise insecure work and to encourage older workers—or even younger workers, for that matter; any worker—who have been hired for less than a year to get sacked. I said my piece before, but this is a very sensible amendment. This was an improvement to a scheme that we hope creates jobs—we hope it does what it promises to do. But this protection is a necessary one to make sure that older workers, or even younger workers, for that matter, are kept on by their employer in this time of economic precariousness and huge unemployment rates. This is an important protection. I just want to make sure that everyone in the chamber understands that that's what this amendment does.</span>

It is the Labor Party that have said we are prepared to support this amended legislation, because we believe in the principles of the scheme, but we're not happy with how it's designed, in many ways, and we would have done it very differently. We are the ones that want to see this injection of cash into the economy in order to support young Australians to get work. </span>

Of course, the wages that they are paid are the wages as dictated in awards, EBAs or other employment conditions. In that sense, what the staff member receives, whether they be an existing staff member or a new staff member, are the wages to which they are entitled. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The payment is designed as an incentive or a wage subsidy. It is an incentive for employers to take on more young Australians. That is the fundamental premise behind this. All the evidence—from the past and recently—is that, when young people get stuck on unemployment benefits, when they get stuck on JobSeeker, they can be stuck for a very long period of time. So this is an incentive for employers so we can avoid that. The evidence from the last recession we had was clear. Youth unemployment took far longer to recover to its pre-recession levels than the overall unemployment rate did. What we are trying to do here is tackle a known problem in previous economic downturns. We are targeting that particular problem and providing an incentive to get young Australians out of the perennial cycle of unemployment that could plague their lives for a long time without this type of intervention.</span>

However, the payroll test is a genuine payroll test. Senator Pratt seems to be assuming that, just because one person works fewer hours, you somehow still achieve a payroll rise by the second person coming on board. That's not necessarily the case. That's why we designed it with the duality of tests to make sure that we have maximum incentives for additional people to get that start in life. Indeed, we know that that start in life—that opportunity to get a job and start a job—provides the platform for further shifts, further hours and further jobs. That is what we see as being crucial in terms of getting people off that awful treadmill of unemployment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance, Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  As outlined before, the scheme is structured so that employment decisions can be made now. Yes, the rules are still in draft form, but within clear parameters people who are well and truly acting in ways that are within the obvious stated intention of the scheme can have certainty, as long as this legislation passes. If the legislation doesn't pass then there is no certainty for the employer who wants to take a young Australian off the unemployment queue and put them in work. We're trying to make sure that, in getting this legislation passed, there is certainty for Australian businesses and that the incentive the government promised in our budget will be available to them so that they can give those young Australians jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those decisions may already be underway, because many employers would have thought that the Labor Party would not join the Greens to filibuster, delay, defer and, potentially, defeat this legislation that will introduce this subsidy and support for the employment of young Australians. Many businesses would get a rude shock if they were to tune in right now and find the Labor Party standing in the way of wage support for the employment of more young Australians. We want to get this legislation passed to provide for certainty so that employment decisions can be made. Yes, we will continue to consult to finalise the rules to make sure that the types of hypothetical scenarios that you're raising, Senator Pratt, are addressed and appropriate standards and mechanisms are in place in the rules. The government will continue to consult to ensure that these rules work effectively for both employment decisions, to get the outcomes the government wants and to ensure the integrity and the operation of the program.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  I want to share two figures, but before I share them I want to point out that, when we get new data, we have the courage and the integrity to change our mind. That's the way our leader works and that's why I'm with her. These two figures were new to us until a little while ago. The Australian unemployment rate for people aged under 35 years is 10.4 per cent. Where do they go when they are unemployed? Drugs, street. The second figure is that the Australian unemployment rate for people older than 35 is four per cent. I know damn well that people around Australia who are over 35 years of age will recognise those figures, because they care about younger people, not just themselves. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Watt appeals to the green in people. We appeal to the good nature in people. The people of Australia will understand that a 10.4 per cent unemployment rate is not acceptable, and something has to be done. As I said, when we get new data, we have the courage and the integrity to change our position. Senator Hanson consulted with me. I might remind you all who initiated the apprenticeship program: the lady in front of me with the red hair, Senator Hanson. That shows we care. As I said before, older people do care about younger people. I now go to the amendments. We only supported two of the amendments; we didn't support the rest of the amendments.</span>

The second amendment we agreed with refers to the duplication of benefits. The Treasurer has shown us the provisions that prevent duplication. There are many details in this legislation that protect people, not just in this bill and not just in the ATO but in the Fair Work Commission. So that's my second point. We were wrong on the amendments and we stand corrected.</span>

                    </a>  I withdraw. The appeals to fear have got to stop. We work with all parties, including the government. We vote with the government more often than the Labor Party, but the Labor Party votes with the government almost 60 per cent, almost two-thirds, of the time. What we do is work with the government and all parties—yes, even the Greens—and shape and mould legislation and change it for the better. Why wouldn't we support it once we've improved it? Why wouldn't we support it when it's been improved? That's what we're doing; we are modifying legislation almost every day, either in this chamber or in government offices or our own offices. We're making sure that only bills that we are happy with come here; if we don't like them, then we vote them down. I didn't like this JobMaker bill initially, but I've given you two figures that changed my mind. I care about young people and older people. Those two figures, again, are that only four per cent of people above 35 years of age are unemployed, and 10.4 per cent of people below 35 years of age are unemployed.</span>

We will support the young and we will support all Australians, and I know that every Australian will support the young. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  I have a few comments to make. In regard to what Senator Murray Watt said earlier about me not caring about older Australians in Queensland, that's not the case at all. The borders needed to be reopened, and my concern was for the whole state and everyone there. We had businesses going under, more suicides happening and more people with mental health problems as well. It was the matter of coronavirus that had people, and those older Australians, in fear. If you have health issues and if you are an older Australian, then you should take care of yourself and possibly think about going and locking yourself away if you want to protect society. But we can't stop businesses and people from getting on with their lives because of the fear factor. That's what it was; it was the fear factor. So, as for not worrying about older Australians—I do, constantly, all the time, but I don't use it as a political football, as I have seen happen in Queensland, in the lead-up to the Queensland election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This whole debacle going on this afternoon is occurring because One Nation—I and Senator Roberts—have now decided not to support the two amendments. We're now not giving our support to them—support which you need to uphold these amendments so that the bill will then go back to the lower house, where you know they will reject it. You want the bill to come back here again, hoping that it will be put on hold for three months so that it will either never come back again or actually cause a double dissolution. These are the games that are being played in this chamber. That's why you're attacking One Nation—because you know that can't happen without our support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I had a meeting with the Treasurer this afternoon in regard to this. This information was put to me in those discussions, and, because I supported the amendments, I raised concerns. What you've got in those amendments about people losing their jobs—under the Fair Work Act they can't just be sacked. That can be questioned under the Fair Work Act. Those protections are in place. That is no different to what it is today in the workplace. Any dismissal can be challenged under the Fair Work Act. If you take up this scheme, you can't have a reduction in the payroll. You can't sack people just to put them on. There are oversights to see to that.</span>

                    </a>  I do know what I'm talking about. Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, you are actually laying the blame because you don't want to see this bill get up. I'm not playing your games in this chamber by using One Nation. After having consultations and talking to the Treasurer, initially, I wasn't in support of this bill—I can tell you that—because I felt that we've paid out so much money. There's the cost to the taxpayer, and businesses out there are saying that they don't particularly need this money. There might be some who will, but what they want are workers. They want people to go out and get these jobs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Youth unemployment in this country is of great concern to me. The average figure is 10.4 per cent. Majority areas of youth unemployment in Australia have 27 per cent youth unemployment. If this is going to help those youth get jobs—give them some incentive to get jobs—then maybe I am wrong. I'm quite willing to admit if I am wrong if it will get the jobs. The Treasury figures are saying there will be 450,000 jobs; I hope that is the case. I'm very sceptical of it, but I hope that is the case. I'm willing to admit if I believe the information that's come before me is wrong.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other amendment was to do with the quarterly reporting. Those reports will be made available to the public. They will be reported to the COVID committee, so they will be available. You put up I think about 10 or 11 amendments yesterday to this bill. I think it's the most I've ever seen in any bill—why? Because you're playing your games again in this place. That's the truth of the matter. If you say that I vote with the Liberal Party all the time—</span>

                    </a>  What about the corporate tax cuts? I didn't support them on that, and that's one of the biggest bills that have been put in this parliament. I didn't support them on the ensuring integrity bill. Plus there are other things that I don't support the government on all the time. The government is the one that puts up the legislation in the place, not the opposition—not the Labor Party. It is the government that puts up the legislation. My job as a senator in this place is to look at the legislation, and I've always said that I will vote on what I think is right for the country and the people. I won't play your games in this place, and I won't make my decisions based on what you think is right, because I know from the opposition benches you have to oppose it because one day you hope to be on the government benches. </span>

                    </a>  Thank you very much. We have said that we have been consulted on this. I'm quite happy with the information that I have received from the Treasurer, not from these voices I'm hearing here. The Treasurer has had legal advice and advice from other people directed from the minister's office, not these bits and pieces. I'll tell you what: over the years in this place, I've been told one thing, and it is definitely not the truth. It has been from ministers from the Labor side who put a spin on things that it's not the truth. So on everything that we do here we like to research, get our information and make an informed decision. You may not like the way that Senator Roberts and I are voting today, but our votes are always based on what we believe is right. That's the way we're going to continue to go. You can make all your snide, smart-arse comments in this chamber—</span>

But I just want to set the record straight: Senator Hanson has a complete misunderstanding of the bill and of the amendment that One Nation agreed to yesterday. So, the bill does not stop employers from firing their staff or from reducing the hours of their staff.</span>

                    </a>  So everyone in this chamber should have it very clear that there is nothing in the bill stopping employers from firing their staff or from reducing their hours. Yesterday we moved an amendment to actually have in the bill a dispute resolution process, which the chamber didn't agree to. So not only can they fire their staff and reduce their hours but those workers have no avenue to complain or to have a dispute resolution process. That's what One Nation are voting for today. They are throwing all workers—young, old or otherwise—under the bus today, and I hope that they will face the consequences of this decision. But, unfortunately, it will be too late for the workers that they have thrown under the bus.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  For the sake of the chamber, I want to clarify the current situation with our laws as they stand with the Fair Work Commission: if you are a worker who has been employed as a casual for less than 12 months, you can be fired with no recourse. So this legislation would allow casual older workers—who may have just got a job back—who've been in their job for less than 12 months to be fired. They can then be replaced by two younger workers being paid on pretty low wages but enough so that the overall wage threshold is slightly higher than it was before with the one older worker. This legislation allows that to occur. It allows our taxpayers' money to be used for that situation: to sack older workers who are already in a casual job, who already had job security—probably for years. It allows them to be sacked and to be replaced by two younger workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you know from this debate, the Greens support absolutely all workers being in work—actually being employed. Anybody who wants to have a job should have the right to have a job, and there are so many ways that we can go about that, particularly if you are spending billions and billions of taxpayers' money to be helping to improve the employment situation for all workers. But particularly we want to see good quality secure work and we do not want to be pitting older workers against younger workers. We can be looking after both. The purpose of this amendment, which we are debating today as to whether the Senate will insist on it or not, is so that we can be looking after both and not throwing older workers under the bus so that unscrupulous employees can then use taxpayers' subsidies to then employ two younger workers in their place.</span>

As the legislation was introduced by the government, that is false. That is an incorrect statement. But the fact is that the amendments that are currently being considered by the Senate actually do ensure that an employer cannot sack someone or reduce their hours in order to receive the hiring credit. Those are the facts. The Prime Minister's claims that he repeatedly made in the other place today are false. They are an inaccurate interpretation of the legislation as it stood when it was introduced. It is only this amendment that would actually ensure that an employer could not fire someone or reduce their hours in order to hire other people to receive the credit. Those are the facts. I put them on the record simply so that the One Nation senators cannot later claim that they did not understand what they are doing here today.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:41</span>):  It does appear, and I hope, that this debate might draw to a close. In conclusion, I really want to highlight some of the confusion that's happened in this debate. Senator Roberts said that he now supports the legislation, as we do too, but we support it with amendments. He referenced the amendments and that One Nation will legislate on just those two questions. I remind him that those two questions—those two amendments—are the ones before the chamber that the Senate is seeking to insist on today. He said that there was no need for One Nation to insist on those amendments because they'd had an alternative agreement with the government that addressed the very same issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to ask the government what that agreement is in terms of its influence on the draft rules. How will the draft rules change in relation to that agreement? Are they in accordance with the amendments that are before the chamber now that we are seeking to insist on? In addition, Senator Hanson referenced some legal advice. I ask if the government will please table that legal advice and supply it to the Senate. It seems to me a ridiculous proposition that One Nation, who agree with us on the amendments and the passage of this legislation, should, rather than go through the parliamentary process accordingly, ultimately be motivated by making a side deal with the government, so that they are complicit with saving the government from the embarrassment of having the message sent back there and then, potentially, if they choose to insist again, it will be sent back here again. But I'm told that One Nation have an undertaking that the government is prepared to address the very issues that One Nation supported here in the Senate in these amendments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I put those questions to you, minister, so that you can inform the Senate exactly what the agreement is with One Nation in relation to the form of the changes to the draft rules that Senator Roberts says are part of their legislating process—to take it outside of this chamber—that they've made that arrangement about the draft rules with you.</span>

But it is most startling and most worrying what is happening to the young. They are disproportionately losing their jobs as a result of the virus that Senator Rice earlier on told us we must take seriously. The virus has impacted on younger people. We need to get those younger people back to work.</span>

One Nation senators did, as Senator Roberts and Senator Hanson have acknowledged, meet with the Treasurer.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020. Labor welcomes the introduction of the national disability bill that we have before the Senate today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to broaden the circumstances in which the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission may make a banning order against a provider or person, and clarifies the commission's powers. The bill addresses some timing issues and shortfalls in the NDIS commissioner's ability to make banning orders against a worker, including that the commissioner does not have power to issue a banning order against a person who is no longer employed or engaged by the NDIS provider and that the commissioner does not have power to make a pre-emptive banning order against a person, whether an individual or otherwise, who has been identified as unsuitable to work with people with disability as a result of their actions in another field, such as aged care or child care. The changes would allow the commissioner to make a banning order against a provider's former employee or other staff and to prevent lapse of a banning order if the employee ceases to be engaged by the provider or the provider leaves the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will also empower the commissioner to include detail of the order, including enough information to identify the person in the publicly-available NDIS Provider Register. Privacy concerns are addressed in the explanatory memorandum, which notes that highly sensitive or personal information, or details on the nature of the incident that prompted the exclusion, will not be included on the register. Labor notes that, once passed by parliament, these amendments will apply immediately to any person, regardless of when they ceased to be engaged in working with people with a disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his second reading speech on this bill the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, Mr Stuart Robert, stated: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The recent tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Ann Marie Smith in South Australia have highlighted just how important it is to have the strongest possible protections available for NDIS participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ann-Marie Smith was a 50-year-old Adelaide NDIS participant who died on 6 April of severe septic shock, multiple organ failure, severe pressure sores, malnutrition and issues connected with her cerebral palsy after being confined to a cane chair 24 hours a day for more than a year. Ann-Marie Smith's NDIS package included six hours of support per day. Reports are that she received only two hours of care per day and had not been seen outside her house in years. Ann-Marie's terrible death is nothing short of a tragedy. She should be alive and thriving. Instead, she was neglected and abandoned, and she died. This is the nightmare of every parent with an adult child with disability. Ann-Marie was failed in life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, therefore, agrees with the minister's statement and acknowledges that Ann-Marie's death likely prompted identification of gaps in the legislation, which this legislation seeks to address. In that sense, Labor is supportive of the changes. However, the bill does not address the issue at the core of Ann-Marie Smith's death. If these amendments had been in place while the abuse was occurring, they would not have prevented Ann-Marie's death, because the care worker, Ms Maione, was an employee at the time of the abuse. That means there is something else not working in the system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shortly after his appointment, in 2018, the inaugural NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner, Graeme Head, gave a speech to CEDA in which he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We're able to take a range of actions including deregistration, banning orders or seeking the application of civil penalties so we really do have a comprehensive tool kit. We have comprehensive regulatory powers and functions, and real regulatory teeth. Incidents that must be reported to the commission include the death of a participant, serious injury, abuse or neglect and importantly also the unauthorised use of a restrictive practice in relation to a participant. It does represent a significant step change in how we approach the delivery of quality services to people with disability and how we protect and prevent neglect and abuse of people with disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said, 'It represents a significant raising of the bar, in terms of how we think about quality and safeguards, in this sector.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These comments have not aged well. If the commissioner has real teeth, why did Ann-Marie's service provider only receive a fine of $12,600 after allowing her carer to neglect her so severely? If the commission has real regulatory powers and functions, why wasn't it overseeing the care that Ann-Marie was meant to be receiving? The government must provide answers to these questions and outline what it intends to do to ensure that the commission's powers are being properly used to prevent abuse and neglect, not just to give a slap on the wrist after the fact. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is a vital national service that, after seven years of Liberal rule, has been slashed and mismanaged to such an extent that people are dying of neglect in their homes. The minister needs to get real and start acting in the interests of Australians with disability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This kind of system failure resulting in death by neglect needs to be approached head-on with honesty and genuine reform. David Harris was found dead in his Parramatta unit. It was two months before his body was discovered by police. After he was found by authorities, his grieving sister, based interstate, learned David's NDIS funding had been cut off because he missed an annual review meeting. This meant cleaners and other NDIS-funded support stopped visiting the 55-year-old, who was schizophrenic, diabetic and incontinent and needed regular injections. How many Australians with disability have to die in their homes before the government and the minister admit there is a problem and confront the issues head-on with honesty and transparency? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has so far presided over $4.6 billion ripped out of the NDIS, with 1,200 Australians with disability dying while waiting to be funded by the scheme. After her brother David's tragic death, Leonne Longfellow asked one thing of Mr Robert, that case managers be introduced to the NDIS. He wrote back saying there were no plans to do that. Labor was relieved when the Morrison government heeded Labor's calls for an independent investigation into the death of Ann-Marie Smith. Labor has argued that it should have been broadened to also look at what went wrong in the case of David Harris. Just as the loved ones of Ms Smith deserve to know that others will not be the victims of failings in the system, so do the loved ones of Mr Harris. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the legislation is a good start, the current scope of the inquiry, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission regulations or lack thereof—if you have look at the inquiry that was put in place with Ms Smith's service provider, Integrity Care, it was clearly limited. The inquiry needed to be free to look at broader considerations, such as whether the $30 million a year commission had been a toothless watchdog across multiple cases, not just Ms Smith's with provider, and whether the deaths by neglect of NDIS participants at home have been exacerbated by the government's removal of $4.6 billion from the scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There also remains a clear residual conflict, with the commission appointing the investigator and the investigator reporting back to the subject of his inquiry. The investigator needed subpoena powers, which Mr Robertson did not have, and disability advocates should be supported if they wish to engage with the process. We also welcome the appointment of an investigator who is separate from the NDIA and the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. This is an improvement on the previous approach of NDIS minister Stuart Robert—burying his head in the sand—albeit a change only brought about by public pressure. Now the government must do the right thing by the memories of David Harris and Ann-Marie Smith. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After Labor called for an independent inquiry into NDIS quality and safeguarding, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission tasked former federal justice Mr Alan Robertson with reviewing the adequacy of the regulation of the supports and service provided to Ms Ann-Marie Smith. The report does not identify any failings in how the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission carried out its function around Ann-Marie Smith's death. Why is that? The Quality and Safeguards Commission didn't fail because the scope of the inquiry was too narrow. The review found there was no wrongdoing with the commission set up to protect NDIS participants. The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission issued a fine of $12,600 to the provider a month after she died for failing to notify the commission of Ann-Marie's death for 24 hours. As far as we know, this is the only fine the commission has issued against a provider since its set-up in 2018—a banning order to the provider Integrity Care four months after Ann-Marie died. We now know that this is the only infringement the commission has ever issued in two years of operation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the course of this review, Mr Robertson took the opportunity to consider wider issues of safeguarding people with disability who are particularly vulnerable, and he issued ten broad-ranging recommendations. The report clearly shows that the commission and the NDIS safeguarding framework are not set up to effectively protect people on the NDIS. The inquiry did issue broad-ranging recommendations, which I urged the government to take up and which they have failed to do in the legislation that we have before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate should note that the government introduced legislation in June, and, if Rosa Maria Maione, Ann-Marie Smith's support worker, was not arrested, she would have still been working nine months later. It's appalling. It's terrible. And the report highlights buck-passing between the NDIA and the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. The legislation before us needs to be amended to actually give real teeth to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission because at the moment they are failing in their duty. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I would first like to foreshadow that second reading amendments will be moved on my behalf by my colleague Senator Thorpe, in the terms circulated in the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight we are considering a bill, the purpose of which is to grant greater powers to the Quality and Safeguards Commission, particularly in relation to its ability to issue banning orders to providers and individuals. As we embark on this consideration, it's critical that we acknowledge both the cultural context in which this conversation is taking place and the policies that have been created in and by that context.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As disabled people in Australia, every single day of our lives we live in a community, a society that has been constructed and shaped by discriminatory thought processes—ableism is the name often put to the discrimination we face as disabled people—and they cover, drench and shape so much of our lives and the communities in which we live. Disabled people and our aspirations and our rights are considered less valuable, less meaningful with less right to be heard than non-disabled people—less than the rights of non-disabled people, than the voices of non-disabled people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This discrimination leads us to live our lives in contexts where we are often subjected to violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation—whether that be in the classroom, where many of us are educated in segregated settings; whether that be in the workplace, where thousands of us work for cents or dollars an hour; or whether that be in housing, where we are often grouped together in institutional settings where we don't have the opportunity to build families, live independently if we so wish and do things as simple as log on to the internet where and when we want to. This discrimination also shows its face in the healthcare system. The reality in 2020 is that the life expectancy of an intellectually disabled person in this country is 24 years less than the rest of the population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From that cultural context has been born a set of policy responses. The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission is one of those policy responses. It was set up in response to the creation of the NDIS as a part of that reform process. Its goal is to provide a safeguarding mechanism for NDIS participants and to enable the investigation and exploration of abuse situations, as well as the registration and accreditation of registered NDIS providers. In that role it has functioned in different jurisdictions now for two years or so with very mixed results.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen in South Australia, particularly in the case of Ann-Marie Smith, the profound failure of that legislated mechanism and the failure of the commission to have a clear line of sight with what was going on with Ann-Marie Smith. Justice Robertson may well have found in particular mechanistic detail that the commission technically didn't do anything wrong, but, broadly speaking, if you have a participant who comes to harm in the deep way that Ann-Marie Smith did then you have a system that is failing, whether or not the rules capture that particular type of failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two things that we need to consider when we look at this legislation. One is what it actually functionally does, and I'll go briefly to that. The legislation before us, as set out in the explanatory memorandum, 'broadens the circumstances in which the commissioner may make a banning order against a provider or person and clarifies the commissioner's powers'. That seems on the surface to be a very reasonable contention, and the Greens do support this bill as written. Broadly though, it does not go to the deeper question of where do such regulatory frameworks fit within the overall effort that must be made to eliminate violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of disabled people in Australia? To that question we are beginning to gather some evidence and answers through the work of the Joint Standing Committee on the NDIS, which is currently conducting an investigation into the functioning of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are learning through that process is that regulatory frameworks are only one part of an overall piece of work that needs to be done. Breaking down institutionalisation and the spaces in which it exists, eliminating discrimination, and enabling people to participate fully in society are the things that ultimately eliminate or greatly reduce the chances that someone is subjected to these kinds of abusive practices. The terminology here is 'natural safeguarding', and it is something which the commission needs to play a greater role in promoting an understanding of in the broader community.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  When Australia's peak sporting body was asked for advice on whether sports should allow males to play women's competitions, why weren't their first questions: Is that fair for female competitors? Is that fair for women? After all, it's no secret that males enjoy significant physical advantages over women and girls. Ten thousand males have run faster than the current Olympic female 100-metre champion. Male weightlifters in the 69-kilo category out lift women in the 108-kilo category. Men hit a golf ball much further and serve a tennis ball much faster. In contact sports, men, on average, have much greater mass, power and speed, which cause collisions with greater force and impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why, when looking at the issue of transgender inclusion, World Rugby turned to the science. They found that it is neither safe nor fair for biological males to play women's rugby. Why, then, when facing the same considerations did Sport Australia produce a document which, by their own admission, didn't even attempt to assess scientifically whether it's safe and fair for males to play women's sport? Why did Australia's peak sporting agency avoid answering these questions and instead delegate the task of providing advice on who should play women's sport to the Human Rights Commission? Why do the guidelines, instead of providing accurate advice on the law, actually mislead sporting clubs and give them the impression they'll be sued for discrimination if they refuse a male from competing in a women's competition? Expert legal advice, provided to me by a prominent QC, describes how Sport Australia's guidelines misrepresent the Sex Discrimination Act, which very specifically provides for female-only sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 12 months I've been attempting to find out why Sport Australia didn't do the obvious and affirm what common sense, science and the law all stipulate—that women are entitled to their own sports. I and women across the country who have been trying to get answers have been stonewalled and provided with spin and contradiction rather than facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's what we do know. Sport Australia refuses outright to say who was consulted on the guidelines or which groups requested their development. Lobby groups fighting for biological males to be able to play women's sport were engaged to advise on the guidelines, while women's groups were not invited to participate. Sport Australia delegated the writing of the guidelines to the Human Rights Commission without providing any brief to consider scientific research relevant to safety and fairness in women's sport. After I continued to ask questions, Sport Australia conceded their guidelines were never intended to be a scientific document. Despite admitting they never looked at the science, the guidelines somehow conclude that there is limited science available, even though World Rugby cite 49 scientific reports in their analysis. Sport Australia has conceded World Rugby's findings of a potential 30 per cent increase in head injury risks to women when playing against transwomen may be correct but refused to reconsider their own guidelines in light of these findings. They seem to suggest we need to see some more women getting head injuries before they reconsider their actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rugby Australia ignored World Rugby's findings when they recently published their own transgender guidelines allowing biological males to play full contact rugby against women. Rugby Australia's guidelines acknowledge they draw heavily on Sport Australia's science-free guidelines. We also know that diversity and inclusion staff at both Sport Australia and Rugby Australia are on the advisory board for Pride in Sport, the lobby group which claimed credit for Rugby Australia and other major Australian sports recently releasing their own guidelines that promote the inclusion of men in women's sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that the interpretation of Commonwealth law in the guidelines, which Sport Australia has said is the sole purpose of the document, is misleading according to legal experts and fails to make clear that the vast majority of sports are entitled to limit their women's competitions to females.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have, in short, is a set of guidelines impacting on women's sport that women weren't consulted about, that its creators admit are not based in science and that legal experts say are predicated on an inaccurate interpretation of the law. It is simply unacceptable for Australia's taxpayer funded peak sporting body to have conspired in secret with favoured lobby groups to undermine the integrity, safety and fairness of women's sport. Australians know that men and women are physically different. They know that this is why women's sport exists and they know that it is not fair and not safe for women to lose the right to their own sports on the basis of a murky, secretive, unscientific deal between bureaucrats and lobbyists.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  I rise to put on the record my admiration and respect for two important groups in the Queensland community. One of them is based on the Gold Coast these days. It's called the StandbyU Foundation, and it's run by a fellow called Chris Boyle. Chris is about as passionate as a person can possibly be about stopping domestic and family violence in our communities. He's also observed that the traditional approach of just telephoning the police when things go wrong hasn't been very effective in reducing the incidence of violence against women—or, indeed, men who experience this violence. So he applied his deep understanding of social work from his years in the field, talking to women about what the barriers are to them—for instance, in leaving situations that are dangerous. He came to understand that domestic violence is really about disconnection; it's really about isolation. The first thing somebody who is perpetrating domestic violence does is isolate their victim from the connections they need to feel safe, to get help and to get the support and strength to be able to defend themselves in an effective way. He realised then that the antidote to isolation is connection. So, StandbyU Foundation's work is all about providing women who are at risk—who are in vulnerable situations—with the connections they need and easy ways to access those connections to get them out of dangerous situations fast and bring them to safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The StandbyU safety shield is a smart watch, which at the touch of a button can bring to your aid some of the people who you know, no matter what, would drop everything and come to help you if you were in danger. That invention has been so successful in a trial of the issue of 100 of the safety shields to women on the Gold Coast. Despite them being highly at risk women and despite the fact that the emergency button on the safety shield was pressed more than 3,000 times, there was only one escalation into actual violence that required emergency services to be called.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now StandbyU are taking it a step further with the help of Westfield Helensvale. They've opened up Magnolia Place. Magnolia Place is a shopfront in the shopping centre, and it provides an opportunity for people who are at risk of domestic and family violence to connect with all of the services that they need to be able to get themselves out of danger and into safety. One of the things Chris observed in his work was that even women in the most restrictive of situations were still allowed to go to the shops, because every family needs food. So it provided an easy way in an accessible place for vulnerable people to get the help that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend Chris and the team at StandbyU, and I also want to give a shout-out to Westfield Helensvale for their generous support for a peppercorn lease of this important project. It is very literally creating opportunities to break a cycle for another generation of young people, and it is providing real ways out of dangerous situations for women in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to another group that is doing great work to break cycles of unhelpful family environments: the GAPDL—a long acronym for the Gladstone body that ordinarily tasks itself with tourism promotion. It also runs parenting programs and, in the Circle of Security program that it makes available through the philanthropic work it does in the community of Gladstone, it's teaching skills to women and men who haven't been raised in environments that show them how to be great parents. It is providing them with the skills they need to give their kids the emotional, physical and holistic support they need to grow up to be great parents themselves. This is a wonderful initiative. I commend all in the team at GAPDL and I urge them to keep up the good work.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Over the last few months I've been participating in the Senate inquiry into unlawful underpayment of employees' remuneration, otherwise known as wage theft. This inquiry is soon going to focus on wage theft in Australian universities. Following the series of investigative pieces published by the ABC's national education reporter, Connor Duffy, and in response to my own questions to the Fair Work Commission, I have referred 13 universities to make submissions and give evidence to the inquiry. Most of them have now made written submissions. Sadly, most of the universities have responded incredibly defensively. They say that, while there may have been errors, oversights or mistakes in paying staff their correct wages, there are no systemic problems. Frankly, this does not stack up with the evidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A survey undertaken by the National Tertiary Education Union in August found widespread problems with underpayment in the sector. This survey, which amassed over 2,000 responses, found that more than three-quarters of academic casuals are not being paid for all their hours of marking outside of class time. Almost 40 per cent of the academic casuals said that tutorials at their institutions are described as other things, such as information sessions, so they are paid less than the full rate. A majority identified administration as a task they are expected to do but for which they don't get paid. There were also many professional non-academic staff who participated and shared their experiences of long-term casual employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These findings are backed up by a new report released just last week by the USyd Casuals Network at the University of Sydney. This involved an audit of casual staff working hours. It found that 84 per cent of participants performed unpaid work during the audit period. Their stolen wages totalled almost $48,000 over the six-week audit, or about $2,500 each on average. Respondents also reported unpaid administrative work, saying they were given 48 minutes per week to complete all administrative tasks, yet reported working six times more than this to get everything done. Women reported having 2.5 times more stolen wages than men. The network says the audit report reflects systemic wage theft at the university. Let's be clear, though: this is not just about Sydney uni; casualisation has run rampant across the whole higher education sector. As government funding has dried up and universities have become more corporatised quasi businesses, they are no longer places where stable and secure work can be considered the norm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So far, I've been really disappointed by how the sector management has responded. As I said, individual university submissions have, on the whole, been very defensive. In their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Australian Higher Education Industrial Association said that it takes exception to the NTEU's unsubstantiated assertions that Australian universities operate under a business model that involves the deliberate underpayment of their staff. The association points, as so many of the universities have done, to mistakes that have meant that a small number of staff may have been underpaid. This isn't good enough. Now is an opportunity for the universities to hit reset. They can participate in the Senate inquiry in good faith; they can come to the table; they can acknowledge that casual staff have a tough gig and have been, in many cases, terribly mistreated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the aftermath of the hideous job-ready-graduates laws passing, and in the context of COVID-19, morale amongst university staff is at historic lows. More than 10,000 have already lost their jobs. Universities should be stepping up and backing their staff and participating in these processes with a view to making things better. Whether that might involve supporting legislative change or looking at how enterprise agreements and other industrial agreements are drafted, and making sure that secure jobs replace casual ones, there are ways to resolve this issue to ensure staff are treated and paid fairly. I look forward to working on this with university staff over the coming months and to supporting them to get a better deal. Ultimately, we should be reimagining our universities to be model places of employment where staff are fairly paid, have excellent conditions and a lifelong career if they want one.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I recently rose in this place to tell the stories of two food delivery workers, Dede Fredy and Xiaojun Chen, who lost their lives on the job for Uber Eats and Hungry Panda. Since I last spoke on the fate of these workers, Chow Khai Shien, a 36-year-old man from Malaysia, was killed in Melbourne while working for DoorDash. He is the third delivery worker to be killed on the job in just one month. Every one of these three workers had aspirations about the life they wanted to have here in Australia, or the life they wanted to provide for their family back home. Every single one of these workers had a family and friends depending on them who have been left devastated, with lifelong grief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I last spoke on this issue, I've also had the privilege of spending time with a very brave woman, Lihong Wei, the widow of Xiaojun Chen. Lihong told me of the heartbreak she felt at losing her husband, and her family, their father. This week, Lihong took the incredibly brave step of giving evidence at the New South Wales parliament's Select Committee on the Impact of Technological and Other Change on the Future of Work and Workers in New South Wales. Through a translator, she spoke of the helplessness of being on the other side of the world when her husband passed, saying: 'All we could do was pray for him, from far away from the homeland. My mother had collapsed, had totally broken down. My father-in-law—he wouldn't dare to tell him the news until now.' She went on further to say: 'I can still not believe that my husband has left us forever. My eight-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter has lost a father. Our elderly parents with grey hair have lost their son forever. I cannot imagine how do we carry on in life. ' Lihong was asked at the hearing why they had decided as a family that Xiaojun should come to Australia. Her answer was clear: 'Because we had thought the two of us had been working too hard in order to bring a happy life to our children, he decided to come to Australia, like so many other people that have come to Australia, so many of us and our ancestors.' Asked about compensation for her husband, she said that Hungry Panda had told her that, according to law, they have no obligations or responsibilities to provide that. However, outside of the law, she said, 'They are happy to provide us much support as they can.' Lihong continued: 'What I cannot understand is, he has been working for Hungry Panda all this time and he has been working so hard. Why is he not entitled to those benefits that every other person is entitled to?' We can't understand that either, Lihong. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent survey conducted by the Transport Workers Union found that a third of food delivery workers had been hurt or injured while working, with the vast majority receiving no support from their company. These workers earn an average of $10 an hour, rain, hail or shine, without super, sick leave or rights. These workers are monitored by the company app literally every second. They literally have a bug on their shoulder that shows companies every movement they make whilst delivering or waiting for a delivery. These companies are so good at measuring what their workers are doing that they can pinpoint a complaint of an alleged slow delivery to a specific worker and kick them off the app without any appeal process. These companies know exactly what's going on with their workers in the streets of Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and across the country. They know about the deaths, the injuries and the harassment that their workers are facing every day. Just today, a motion was passed by the Senate in support of those workers. Also I'm pleased to say <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> in its editorial made a plea for rights for these gig workers, these food delivery workers, these frontline workers who have been so important and critical during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But neither the companies nor this government are doing anything about it. The exploitation of gig workers continues. It's ongoing. It demonstrates horrendous lack of regard for some of the most vulnerable people in our community, Australian and foreign born workers in this country. They die, they get exploited and they don't have support. Can the government change its position?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Earlier this year, three-year-old Brittney Conway swallowed a button battery. After weeks in the Queensland Children's Hospital and despite the best efforts of her doctors, Brittney died. Last month, her parents Lorraine and David Conway spoke publicly about the death of their daughter. They described Brittney as a girl with a thousand sparkles in her eyes. I cannot imagine the heartache and pain they have endured.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago, more than 30,000 LED wristbands were distributed at the AFL grand final. Kidsafe Queensland warned the wristbands contained button batteries that were not properly secured and that there was a significant risk of harm, particularly to children. The AFL subsequently issued an urgent safety recall.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brittney Conway's death and the AFL recall are reminders of the risks some products pose. They are also reminders that Australia's consumer safety laws are totally inadequate. Australia does not have a mandatory safety standard for button batteries despite 20 children being hospitalised after swallowing batteries each and every week—20 children a week.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year, the ACCC proposed mandatory standards to improve battery safety. They said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Without such mandatory safety standards it is likely we will continue to see further deaths and serious injuries associated with button batteries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is yet to act. It makes me angry that we continue to see deaths and injuries while we wait.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mandatory safety standards only exist for around 44 product types. That is a very small group of products. For every other product, consumer law is reactive. We wait until something bad happens before we take any form of action. Australia has more safety recalls than any other OECD country—around 650 each and every year. But fewer than half of recalled products are returned. The other half, almost two million unsafe products, are still in people's homes. That is why unsafe products cause more than 700 deaths and an incredible 50,000 injuries in Australia every year. That is totally unacceptable. But it's not surprising. There is no law in Australia that prevents a business from selling an unsafe product. This needs to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to legislate a general product safety provision. This would mean businesses are obligated to ensure the products they sell are actually safe. Many other countries already have such obligations. Britain has had a general safety provision for more than 30 years. The EU implemented a similar rule in 1992. Even the United States has a provision for children's products. But not Australia. The Productivity Commission considered the matter in 2006 and again in 2008 and noted the benefits of a safety provision. But they found, incredibly, that they were outweighed by the costs. Children are dying, but the prime consideration was cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the government's position until the review of Australian consumer law in 2017. It is harder than ever for consumers to understand product safety, so the obligation must shift to manufacturers and retailers. A general product safety provision would create incentives for businesses not to sell unsafe product and it would empower regulators to ensure safety, allowing unsafe products to be withdrawn before any potential tragedy occurs. It would also help Australian manufacturers, giving international consumers more confidence in the quality of our products.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are plenty of good reasons to support a general safety provision, but surely the most important one is that it will keep our children safe. I hope government will listen. If not to me or to the ACCC, they should listen to Lorraine and David Conway when they talk about their beautiful daughter, Brittney.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I rise tonight to talk about an extraordinary regional woman who grew up in the Wandoan region and now lives, with her husband and family, at Kingaroy. I speak of course of Deb Frecklington. Until recently, Deb Frecklington was the leader of the LNP in Queensland. She led the party over days, weeks and months into what proved to be a very difficult election in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deb and Jason have three exceptional daughters, girls that I have got to know over the past couple of years, and I think they have done an amazing job, particularly given the very public role that Deb has taken on. As all of us here know, taking on a role in public office means you give up quite a bit of your personal life. But that is even more so for somebody taking on a leadership role in the way that Deb and, to a large extent, Jason did, because you're subject to all the public scrutiny and discussion that leaders are subjected to. During that time, Deb always maintained the kindness, wisdom and graciousness of a lovely person, and one who was the right person to lead the party through that period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to thank Deb and I want to thank the candidates for North Queensland whom I had the pleasure and privilege of getting to know: Nipper Brown, in Cook; Linda Cooper, in Barron River; Sam Marino, in Cairns; Gerry Vallianos, in Mulgrave; Nick Cuda, in Hill; Scott Piper, in Hinchinbrook; Marnie Smith, in Traeger; John Hathaway, in Townsville; Natalie Marr, in Thuringowa; Glenn Doyle, in Mundingburra; and of course the ever-energetic Dale Last, in Burdekin. The LNP team worked incredibly hard together. They were very disciplined and they went about the job of presenting a plan for Queensland to come out of the coronavirus crisis. It's been a time when we have seen businesses in terribly difficult circumstances, families whose lives will forever be marked by the liquidation of their business—businesses like pubs and clubs, travel agencies, movie theatres, restaurants, tourist operations. I think daily of those people who've been so affected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queenslanders made a decision on 31 October. They decided to move forward with the Labor government. We've had 25 years of the last 30 under Labor in Queensland, and in regional Queensland we have borne the price of that. Now it is time that we not just rebuild Queensland after the coronavirus but move back to a more even playing field for the regions, particularly for North Queensland. So today, as the new cabinet has been approved, I've already written to Meaghan Scanlon, the new environment minister, to ask her that we work together in a collegiate way to ensure that we have proper, outcomes based environmental outcomes for cane farmers and farmers right across the state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll be engaging with Scott Stewart, the new resources minister, to ensure that the North West Minerals Province and its $1 trillion of proven reserves are able to be accessed and utilised in the new minerals that are held in that region, that the CopperString project proceeds and that the great water projects that have already been identified in North Queensland are built—Big Rocks Weir at Charters Towers, Urannah at Mackay, the Hughenden Irrigation Project, the Richmond irrigation scheme, Cave Hill at Cloncurry, Nullinga at Cairns and the water project up at Laura. There are lots of opportunities for North Queensland and it is only for government regulation and the will to support companies that are ready to invest in and build our regions, because it is in our regions that we grow our food and fibre, we mine our minerals and we grow the best families and young people in the state.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Tonight I want to draw the Senate's attention to the plight of workers at the Goonyella Riverside Mine near Moranbah, in Central Queensland. Recently, BHP distributed a memo to workers at the mine about Christmas Day and Boxing Day. The memo reads: 'We are again considering operating Goonyella mine over Christmas Day and Boxing Day 2020. Shortly you will have the opportunity to express interest in working over the period. The company does not require any employees to work over Christmas Day and Boxing Day. We respect that for some employees these days are important for them to not be at work due to family, religious or other personal circumstances.' It goes on to explain how people can apply for the privilege of working on Christmas Day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also contains a footnote: 'The rates for working on Christmas Day and Boxing Day do not apply to Operations Services employees and contractors. Operations Services employees should seek advice from their leaders on contractor rates as set by the contracting companies.' The thing is that Operations Services employees are BHP employees—at least, that is what BHP tells us in its marketing videos on YouTube and its sponsored ads on Twitter. But the reality is that these workers who work for OS will have to work on Christmas Day because it's in their agreement. They don't get to choose to work on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, and if they work on Christmas Day and Boxing Day they will not get paid additional rates. It is curious why you would get to a situation where you have two tiers of workers working at the same mine site doing the same job but getting paid different pay on Christmas Day, of all days, and not being able to choose to spend that day with their families if they wish to. It takes me back to when these OS agreements were organised by BHP as a way of getting around the enterprise agreements that existed on mine sites in Central Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers and unions have raised concerns about these agreements since they were made. I came across these agreements in 2008. I was working at the AMWU, and I remember picking up the phone and on the other end was Chris Harper—the AMWU coal shop steward in the area. He said to me these words: 'You know, this doesn't look right. It just doesn't look right.' And you know what? It didn't. When you have a look at these agreements, they don't include the acronym BHP and they don't clearly say that these people will work for BHP. But that's how OS got started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">BHP registered two companies in 2018, and between them they employed about 80 people. They put agreements to these employees without engaging unions or having employee representatives present. These agreements would apply to anyone working at the company's mine sites, no matter which site they worked at, yet BHP only took these agreements to a certain amount of employees working in Western Australia. The maintenance agreement that I'm referring to was signed off by nine employees in Western Australia, and now it applies to thousands of workers in Central Queensland working at sites all over Central Queensland where there are already enterprise agreements in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The agreements are currently being appealed, and one of the tests that are being looked at is the better off overall test. That's a legal question. But these agreements just don't pass the pub test either—or the moral test, or the fairness test. Ultimately, what they mean is that you have workers on site doing the same job and wearing the same uniform but getting different rates of pay. On this side of the chamber we have always firmly believed that if you do the same job you should get the same pay. It is simple. It is the case of OS employees, when they are wearing exactly the same shirt with the same logo on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, whenever it comes to standing up for workers' rights in these mines, the Liberal-Nationals go missing. They have done it time and time again, and they are not standing up on this occasion to put a stop to these agreements. They're trying to make sure that workers have to work on Christmas Day without pay. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
