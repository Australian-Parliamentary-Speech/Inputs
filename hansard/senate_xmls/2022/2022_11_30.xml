              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since February, there has already been significant progress in implementing the 28 recommendations of the report. Legislation has been amended to clarify our duties in respect of employment, antidiscrimination and work health and safety laws. Proposed codes of conduct will be released shortly that cover the work of parliamentarians, staff and parliamentary workplaces, and I commend that committee on its work today. Changes to the sitting calendar and hours of sitting now consider wellbeing, balance and flexibility. New parliamentarians and their staff have participated in refreshed induction processes. A feasibility study into a parliamentary health and wellbeing service is being conducted, with plans to improve services for parliamentarians and staff, including GP services, pharmaceutical services and mental health supports. Work is underway to improve work health and safety, accessibility for those with disability and professional support available for parliamentarians and staff. The Parliamentary Workplace Support Service has been expanded. It is already providing confidential support and advice to those in Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces. The Senate and House procedure committees are examining orders and conventions to improve levels of safety and respect in the chamber and to enhance wellbeing balance and flexibility.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking forward, some of the notable work underway includes the establishment of a new human resources function to support parliamentarians and their staff and the development of new measures to support greater diversity and inclusion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The framework for action set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Set the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">standard</span> report is leadership, diversity and inclusion, accountability and safety and wellbeing.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:06</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, my Fair Work Amendment (Equal Pay for Equal Work) Bill 2022 was drafted in response to exploitation of casual coalminers in central Queensland and the Hunter Valley. It's since been widened. My bill was referred to the Education and Employment Legislation Committee for inquiry, and I thank the committee for organising a public hearing so miners could testify about their exploitation personally. The committee found there was a need for my bell yet then recommended waiting for the government's version. Labor announced its hollow 'fair work for fair pay' idea back in 2018, four years ago. Labor and the unions campaigned on their bill in the 2019 state election in New South Wales and the 2019 federal election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that Labor's bill did not exist. I confirmed that and began drafting my bill in April 2021. Labor's bill was not introduced into parliament until December 2021, a month after my bill was completed and three years after Labor first promised it. If the Labor Party were serious about fixing this issue, their bill would have appeared in 2018, not four years later after One Nation repeatedly called them out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's bill was a dog's breakfast, so the government has chosen to start over. Now, I accept the government saying it's just started meeting with stakeholders, yet a briefing with the minister's advisers last week revealed that consultation has only been with the companies and union bosses that perpetrated this scandal. The miners, air crew, ground crew and other workers ripped off for tens of millions in wages have not yet been consulted after six months, which of course means the Labor Party, the CFMMEU and the industry are trying to find a way to keep these labour-hire contracts going. I'll explain why in a minute. And so I'm advancing my bill, preparing for a vote early next year. I thank Senator Babet for allowing me to use his bills time today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Early in my career, I spent three years in the union as an underground coalface miner, including in the Hunter and Queensland. My father was an underground coalface miner, senior executive and later Queensland Chief Inspector of Coal Mines. He was awarded an Order of Australia for eliminating black lung in our state's coal industry. Having completed an honours degree in engineering, I returned to manage coalmines, which involved daily interaction with the CFMEU in the Hunter and in Queensland. This issue is very personal to me because the CFMEU and its predecessor, the Miners Federation, were once strong unions that looked after and served their members. The reports I received in my Senate office in 2019 from Queensland and the Hunter have shocked me. After visiting these areas repeatedly and listening to miners, I was no longer shocked. I am outraged at the injustice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big picture is this. Labour hire companies were employing casuals in black coal industry production despite the award not allowing it. It was illegal. Exclusion of casuals extends beyond the black coal industry. It includes airline flight crew and other awards, which I will speak to in a moment. Back to the black coal award. Casuals are excluded for a good reason. Coal mining can be dangerous. It requires training and constant skilling to improve productivity and, most importantly, for safety—safety of an individual miner and safety of the whole mine and everyone in it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Underground miners typically retire ahead of most other industries, when they can no longer do the physical work. That's why proper unions like the old Miners' Federation negotiated high rates of pay. The modern award is much lower than negotiated rates because it assumes miners can be reskilled and redeployed into other industries after they exit from mining, allowing for a full working life. That's a fairytale. That simply ignores the reality of life in the coal industry. Labour hire contracts are used to cut miners' wages. This represents a 40 per cent cut in wages against the pay a permanent miner earns in a mine's direct employ, doing the same job, side by side. Two Australians working side by side doing the same job on the same shift, and one is getting 40 per cent less than the other. That is wrong. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been going on for 10 years under the Hunter CFMEU, working with some mining companies and with protection from the local Labor members, Joel Fitzgibbon and now Dan Repacholi. Casual coal workers on labour hire contracts supposedly receive a loading for loss of holiday and sick pay; yet their pay packets are still 40 per cent less. What caused this large reduction in pay was not the absence of loading, because that was supposedly paid. It was the very low base rate that the CFMEU installed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2021 One Nation supported the concept of not enabling workers paid for casual loading because that was paid. What we did was to ensure that workers retained their rights under industrial laws to take legal action for illegal pay rates. Yet the CFMEU then lied, shouting that One Nation stopped workers from getting what was theirs. No, we upheld miners' rights to pay and entitlements while at the same time protecting small business from being forced to pay casual loading twice, as some union bosses dishonestly demanded. It was the union that signed up on these enterprise agreements that robbed workers of 40 per cent of their pay. The Hunter CFMEU pocketed union dues from labour hire casuals and money from labour hire employers for dodgy enterprise agreements with low pay rates. It was the Hunter CFMEU that jointly directed coal long-service leave funds that under-accrued and avoided paying employer contributions to labour hire casuals. I exposed that, and a government review later confirmed me as correct. It was originally a Hunter CFMEU owned labour hire company that collected fees from the mines for supplying labour under a labour hire contract. The CFMEU is clearly directing labour to protect their nice little earner, even at the expense of the workers that the Hunter CFMEU supposedly pretends to represent, while hypocritically and deceitfully speaking badly of casual employment and workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee report accurately describes the effects on communities of the reduction in local spending due to taking wages out of the community. I was lucky enough to find a lawyer who drew these agreements up on behalf of Hunter labour hire companies and who has since seen the error of his ways. His advice informed my bill. Many exploited workers contributed to my bill. I have the most knowledgeable legal minds on labour hire contracts in the coal industry contributing to my bill, and I have generations of personal experience in the coal industry. What confuses my critics is that I'm not lining the IR club pockets with overly complex wishy-washy nonsense that opens more loopholes than it closes, as Labor's short-lived dog's breakfast did. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My bill will fix this mess. My bill sets an additional provision for Fair Work Australia to require an enterprise agreement to pass before being approved. It allows an employee to appeal an existing enterprise agreement to Fair Work if an enterprise agreement breaches this new provision. The provision is simple: a worker on a labour hire contract must be paid the same rate of pay, including allowances, as a worker who is directly employed doing the same job on the same shift roster. That is clear. If the whole crew is labour hire, then the commissioner must make a judgement on what the rate of pay should have been based on historical information and a comparison with similar mines in similar conditions. That is clear. The cost of using labour hire contractors will now fall on the employer rather than the worker. The intention is to require the employer to project their labour requirements, employ, train and nurture their people—like employers used to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One complication is that some workers are on day shift and others on rotating shift. My bill takes that into consideration. Clause 3(b) of the bill expressly provides that the roster the employee is working must be considered in the assessment of equal pay for equal work. The committee report correctly identifies when labour hire contracts subvert the black coal mining industry award 2010 and the aircraft cabin crew award 2020. I've circulated an amendment to this bill to include the airline operations ground staff award 2020 which makes provisions for casuals that foreign companies bypass to exploit workers through labour hire contracts. I know Senator Sheldon is leading a fight against that exploitation. My bill will give him the ammunition to drag the whole situation back to Fair Work. I urge Senator Sheldon and Labor to adopt it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My bill's simplicity will prevent lawyers feasting because it allows Fair Work commissioners discretion to make value judgements. I reckon they're up to it. The remaining awards are excluded in the Fair Work Amendment (Equal Pay for Equal Work) Bill 2022 as a line in the sand. While labour hire agreements are not being abused in these industries, explicitly including those awards in this legislation was designed to ensure labour hire firms do not treat these awards as a new profit centre once the opportunity for exploitation is removed from coalmining and aircraft operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Witnesses who discussed their treatment under labour hire contracts were pleased to have the opportunity to publicly testify, and I thank the committee. These workers were not always afforded that opportunity. Stuart Bonds, from the Hunter, listed case after case after case where miners have been employed under labour hire agreements with a 40 per cent reduction in pay rate. More troubling were the stories of exploitation and victimisation these workers received, especially following a safety report or physical harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Simon Turner testified to the committee on his inhumane experiences as an injured worker. He's one of many, sadly. Workers like Simon tried for years to get justice. The mine owner and the labour hire company completely ignored him—tossed him on the scrap heap. The Hunter CFMMEU betrayed workers. Local Labor MPs let them down. Only when workers came to One Nation was progress made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another worker on a labour hire contract saw a safety issue—water trucks laying down too much water, creating slippery conditions—and reported it. This worker was required to report that safety issue. Her contract was terminated the next week. There's no job security in labour hire contract arrangements. Workers injured at work were refused medical treatment and not paid workers compensation or accident pay as legally required. Workers were afraid of reporting safety issues for fear of being sacked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers were rostered two years in advance to work 52 weeks of the year straight—no holidays. If you're working a full-time 12-hour shift and being given these shifts two years ahead then you're not casual. You are a permanent worker. Despite being, in effect, permanent these workers are unable to get home loans, car loans and provide a future for themselves and their families because banks won't lend to casual labour hire employees. When I say exploitation I mean exploitation!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All this happened with the Hunter CFMMEU doing deals enabling mining companies more interested in profits than basic human decency. Labour hire deals and contracts are used to lower wages across an entire industry. Qantas pulled this stunt on their ground crew. They fired thousands of workers and re-employed them through labour hire companies at the lowest rate of pay. What's a worker to do? Refuse the deal and have no job or take the deal and try to get by on 40 per cent less? Qantas are using these tricks on flight crew and pilots as well. Senator Sheldon can speak to this, so I won't. Correct loading on a plane is vital to flight safety and people on the ground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my meeting with Qantas, their executives defended their behaviour as being 'necessary to maintain viability'. Qantas have run their staff into the ground, cut staff pay to the bone, moved staff from full-time secure jobs to casual junk jobs, worked staff on shifts with not enough time to recover, provided insufficient training and supervision—and now things are going wrong. What a surprise! And they belted loyal, long-serving employees with COVID injection mandates. One Nation's Fair Work Amendment (Equal Pay for Equal Work) Bill 2022 remains the only legislation before parliament designed to correct this unfair and dishonest corporate behaviour. It should have been in the government's Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022, but it's not. Yet it's not too late. Here it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll now discuss the specific topics in the committee report. Firstly, the bill does not act widely enough. My bill allows the minister to add more than the seven awards this bill currently covers by using a disallowable instrument where exploitation occurs. It allows the minister to remove that listing should an industry stop exploiting. This is surely best practice? Only act where there's a problem, and only for as long as the problem exists. Adding 700-plus awards 'just in case' will needlessly add to the cost and complexity of our industrial relations system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, definitions of key concepts. The definitions enabled every submitter to correctly understand my bill's intent, yet some of them went on to say the definitions were incomplete after correctly identifying the meaning of the words used. The wording was chosen carefully because once a term is given a specific meaning, that meaning is considered the term's full meaning. Cunning lawyers use detailed definitions to limit a term's application. This allows for deficiencies in definitions to be exploited as loopholes. I will not play the industrial relations club's game. It's up to the Fair Work Commissioner to decide if a labour hire agreement falls under this bill's provisions. Should the Fair Work Commission fail to honour this legislation's intent, then and only then should we wander into the legal minefield of definitions that become exclusionary rather than inclusionary. It's time to start using clear language expressing clear principles and rely on the Fair work Commissioner to exercise their wisdom and knowledge and to follow these principles in their judgements. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My bill's intention and action: my bill provides a provision to existing provisions that enterprise agreements must pass to meet the Fair Work Commission's approval. This test is in section 321 of the Fair Work Act 2009 to show this equal pay for equal work provision is separate and additional to the better off overall test—the BOOT test. Section 321 is exactly where this provision belongs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the supposed downside that some vested interests attribute in broad terms comes from the same entities who turned industrial relations into a club for their own profit and power at the workers' expense. These entities do very well from complexity. Workers pay the price in so many ways. This must stop. If the government is serious about equal pay for equal work, get on with it. I thank senators contributing to this debate and look forward to bringing the bill to a vote at the next opportunity.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade and Tourism, Special Minister of State and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Sena</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">te</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:21</span>):  I thank Senator Roberts for his contribution. I would make the observation that if Senator Roberts is serious about trying to improve industrial relations in this country and has some genuine comments and contribution to make, maybe the best way to start is sitting down with that terrific minister, the industrial relations minister, Minister Burke, and start working with him about how we might improve industrial relations in this country, and in particular how we might start the ball rolling on lifting wages so that workers have a chance to compete with rising prices that they see everywhere. Of course we know that it was a design feature of the former government, the former government which Senator Roberts supported over and over and over again, with all of their crazy policies that have led to the extremely difficult economic circumstances which Australian workers find themselves in. Maybe if Senator Roberts hadn't supported the former government as often and consistently and regularly as he did, Australian workers might actually be in a slightly better position.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course they're going to be in a lot better position when the new bill passes in the next couple of days, which is going to lift the standard of living of Australia workers and give them a chance to catch up with those rising prices. I see Senator Barbara Pocock in the room. When I first started working with the shop assistants' union in 1976 we still had different rates of pay for men and women. There would be one rate of pay for a man, which would appear on one side of the wage regulated documents. On one side of the page there would be a rate for the men, and on the other side of the page there would be a rate for a woman, for exactly the same job. In this country we had different rates of pay. It's hard to believe, and you have to go back a very long time to see that, but in wage determinations in this country there were differences between men and women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we have quite a different concept of equal pay for equal work these days. We're not talking about the overt discrimination that existed in wage determinations in this country for most of the last century. We're talking about quite a different proposition, of course, and that proposition is that there are industries where women predominate and which, if they were fairly valued, would have a higher rate of pay. The reason that the rate of pay isn't higher is that they are predominantly female industries. That's the issue that the Labor Party is seeking to address and will address in the course of this parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will first talk about what the Labor Party is proposing to do to fix the problems that Senator Roberts claims that he's fixing in this bill—and again I make the offer to Senator Roberts: if you're fair dinkum about trying to lift the living standards of workers in this country, maybe the best way is to cooperate with a government that is also interested in doing that, sitting down and telling us how you think we might be able to advance the interests of working people in this country. I haven't seen any evidence in the whole of the time that you've been in this place, Senator Roberts, that you've been remotely interested in that issue. Every single decision that you took over the previous parliaments to back in the policies of this mob when they were in government did damage to the people you now say—</span>

We had a plan for this very issue that Senator Roberts claims that he's got some interest in. Now, under the Secure Australian Jobs plan, the government committed to delivering more secure jobs, better pay and fairer workplace relations, including ensuring that labour hire workers and workers engaged in other non-standard arrangements such as outsourcing receive no less than directly engaged employees performing the same work. It's a very simple proposition that, if you're doing a job that's valued at a particular rate of pay under an award, agreement or some other instrument, if somebody else comes into your workplace to do the same job, that person should receive the same pay.

                    </a>  We have a mandate. I've just seen Senator Sheldon come into the Senate. He spent a lifetime trying to resolve some of these issues, because he saw firsthand how unfair it is in a workplace where one group of workers, no doubt having the benefit of a union-negotiated agreement, which the fantastic Transport Workers Union would have negotiated for them, and then a whole lot of other workers come in on a lower rate of pay. We're going to do something about this. As I mentioned, Minister Burke is on the job. He's been doing nothing else since he came into this job six months ago but trying to fix the problem and create a fairer workplace.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, under the Fair Work Act—and some people could describe it currently as the 'Unfair Work Act'—a labour hire employee and a directly employed employee may be engaged under different industrial instruments. As Senator Urquhart would know, that's code for a lower rate of pay for somebody coming in as a labour hire employee. I'm sure that over her wonderful career she would have dealt with these types of problems and, my guess is, successfully sorted them out. But you can't sort them out everywhere. You need industrial relations legislation to do that, and that's what the Labor Party is about. In those circumstances, we've seen workers doing the same job, undertaking the same work, on a vastly different set of wages and conditions. Not only is that unfair; it also creates tensions in the workplace. If people are doing the same job and they're on a different set of terms and conditions, naturally, those people will be dissatisfied.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government acknowledges that there may be, from time to time, legitimate uses for labour hire, such as instances where employees use labour hire to provide surge capacity or important expertise that is not available within its own workforce. So we're not saying ban all labour hire. But the proposition is that, if you're doing the same job, you should be getting the same rate of pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of all those distractions, I've not had a chance to address some of the provisions in this bill. I want to do that in the remaining time I have. This bill is targeted at prospective contracts or arrangements entered into by the employer, namely the labour hire employer, with another person, described as the host employer, for a labour hire employee for the labour hire employer to perform work for the host employer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first observation the government would make about this proposed legislation is that there is a lack of clarity and practicality regarding the application of equal pay obligations. These include obligations that apply from day one and do not address situations where, for example, a labour hire employee is moving from host to host, and there is only one civil remedy provision, which is drafted in a manner that is not consistent with the way underpayments are ordinarily dealt with under the Fair Work Act. So it's introducing a whole lot of new concepts which are not consistent with the way a worker would ordinarily expect to prosecute a case if they felt they had been disadvantaged as a result of provisions in their workplace. This is likely to lead to ambiguity, and the bill could give rise to unintended consequences if legislated in this current form.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I make the offer to Senator Roberts: if you are fair dinkum about trying to resolve some of these issues at the workplace, come and sit down at the minister and his staff, and let's start correcting all those issues that arose under the life of the previous government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is targeted only at labour hire in specific sectors based on award coverage, namely—the Black Coal Mining Industry Award, the Aircraft Cabin Crew Award, the Firefighting Industry Award, the Maritime Offshore Oil and Gas Award, the Seagoing Industry Award, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Enterprise Award, and there is a provision for the minister to add more via a legislative instrument. The bill does not deal with outsourcing or any other arrangements. </span>

                    </a>  I wouldn't mind that wine, yes, thank you! I'm deputy chair of the Education and Employment Committee with Senator Sheldon as chair. I want to just say before I make my remarks that I always respect and admire the way that Senator Roberts brings issues to this place and the way that on this inquiry he sincerely brought forward the issues that this bill contends with. I really admire and respect him and I appreciated his contribution, his passion and his commitment to this issue and, indeed, to the workers in that industry. As author and key contributor to the additional comments that were put into the report, while we indicated that we don't support this bill—at least the make-up of it, the particular provisions and how it's been put together—I wanted to say that I very much respect Senator Roberts's longstanding connection and commitment to this issue and, indeed, particularly to those working in the black coalmining industry. Senator Roberts worked as an underground worker in the coalmining industry, so he does have firsthand experience and, obviously, through that, he has a very deep connection to not just the issue but, indeed, the people who are connected with it. The witnesses he was able to arrange to come before the committee clearly had a lot of respect for Senator Roberts and they came and presented very passionately their issues. I really appreciated that and appreciated being able to sit, listen and inquire of them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does primarily focus on the Black Coal Mining Industry Award and the Aircraft Cabin Crew Award 2020, as well as four other awards that currently do not have provisions for casual employment. The coalition does believe that this bill, erroneously, seeks a one-size-fits-all approach. It overlooks the nuances of the labour hire industry. It will have unintended consequences and ignores some of the really important fundamentals, including the desire by some workers to have flexibility and other benefits afforded to them by being labour hire employees. Before coming into this place, I was running an organisation called Generation One, which is an Aboriginal employment agency. Through that organisation, we saw tens of thousands of long-term unemployed Aboriginal people take up training that led to a guaranteed job. It's something that I'm very, very proud of. I hope I can have a similar sort of impact in this place. When I look at the work that I did there through the excellent team that we had there and across the country, it's something I'm very proud of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We worked a lot with labour hire businesses in creating those opportunities. Sometimes, in this debate, there's a real denigration of labour hire, but it does have a place. It particularly has a place for those who have been unemployed for a long time and who might have significant and multiple barriers to employment. In terms of being able to step out of long-term unemployment and establish a pattern of work, sometimes labour hire provides a unique and flexible environment that enables them to make that transition from having no work and no pattern of work to picking up some casual work, perhaps starting part time or on reduced hours and building their capacity over time. So our organisation was able to use labour hire. We worked with many different businesses—and some of them were subject to this inquiry—that were able to provide a stepping stone for people who had been long-term unemployed with low skills but who, through that transitional intermediary role that labour hire was able to play, were able to transition into longer term sustainable full-time work. So I think it's really important that there is a bit of balance in this debate—a balance that, I know, Senator Roberts did bring into it. We've got to be careful that labour hire isn't denigrated. I respect Senator Farrell's comments that there is a place for labour hire. There is definitely a place for labour hire. I join the concern that it might displace permanent jobs, but there is a place for it and I think we've got to be careful we don't denigrate it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian coal industry has played a significant role in the modern prosperity of this country and in our economy. Like other sectors of the mining industry, it has provided numerous employment opportunities and benefited regional communities across Australia. The coalmining industry employs around 50,000 workers across Australia with another 120,000 indirect jobs supported by the industry. As a valuable commodity, coal is Australia's second-largest export after iron ore—which is primarily coming out of my home state of Western Australia—and accounts for approximately 11.5 per cent of Australia's total exports. As well as being a strong economic driver and an export commodity, coal is an affordable, reliable source of electricity. While there are detractors of coal in this place, I'm not one to diminish and disrespect the valuable role that coal plays within our industries and our economy and the wealth that it creates. Without doubt, the coal industry has played a pivotal, influential part of the narrative of the Australian success story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding the role of labour hire, I do respect that there are significantly diverse views on this matter. As I've said, I don't, however, share the sentiments espoused by some who have sought to demonise the vital function played by the labour hire industry. For many businesses—particularly when it comes to shutdown work in the mining sector, when you need a surge capacity or you need to bring in a temporary workforce that can move in and move out—labour hire obviously plays a critical role.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to representations made in relation to labour hire and proportion of the broader workforce, the current use of labour hire in the Australian workplace is not considered at epidemic level. In fact it's only one per cent of the Australian workforce that are employed within labour hire firms. This proportion is lower than it has ever been, or at least in the last 10 years. In their submission to the EEC, the Australian Industry Group stated that a policy such as equal pay for equal work is unfair, inappropriate and unworkable. Additionally, the AiG contends that the bill does not sufficiently define what a labour hire employer is or what a labour hire employee is, resulting in some businesses inadvertently being caught up by the provisions of this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the remaining moment I have in this debate I want to pick up on a couple of things that Senator Farrell said. In discussing the government's plans in this area, the government's plans around the fair work bill and the amendments, he said that they have a mandate to do some of the things that they said that they are going to do, that no doubt we'll be debating later today. I find it really interesting that Senator Farrell says that there is that mandate and it was something that they took to the Australian people and got support from the Australian people for it. Granted they did say it was part of their slogan throughout their campaign that they will get wages moving, and lines like that, talking points like that. I absolutely give you that. Australians clearly supported the government. You won; we don't deny that. It's disappointing. I'm disappointed by that result, but it happened and we're living with it right now. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Labor senators can't say that they have a mandate for the particular provisions of this bill when they actually ruled it out. Mr Chalmers, the now Treasurer, when he was in opposition, when he was the shadow Treasurer ahead of the election, was asked in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> program back in November whether or not industrywide bargaining was part of the government's plan. He categorically ruled it out. He said 'We have no plan for that.' Maybe they're just weasel words that members of parliament are very adept at using sometimes. 'We have no plans for this.' Maybe the shadow Treasurer, as he was at the time, wasn't in the loop with the government's industrial relations agenda, because he didn't quite know what the then opposition would do if they were to form government and bring in such wide-ranging significant changes to the industrial relations landscape. Or maybe he actually knew that it would be catastrophic to the economy if such a change was brought in. Because he said that they had no plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish they had stuck to that, because the plans that the government actually had to change the landscape of the industrial relations system are so significant. Bringing in multi-employer bargaining and allowing for anticompetitive natures to be brought into the bargaining system is going to be incredibly troubling to the Australian economy. For example, you've got a situation where you could have Coles and Woolworths having to bargain together in a shopping centre and then rope in all the other smaller retailers that are in that shopping centre, even though those businesses may not have the HR departments, the in-house counsel, the legal advice readily available to them in the same way that a big company like a Coles or a Woolworths might have. These companies could easily be roped in. I see there are some changes to the thresholds that might allow businesses to be excluded—lifting from 15 to 20—but you're not actually a very big business to have 20 employees. All you need to have is a regular pattern of work to be included, so casuals can easily be included. So you can see situations where businesses are going to be caught up in this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government don't actually have a mandate on their proposals. They don't have the mandate. Yes, we want to see wages moving. Of course we do. Everyone does. But we can't create a situation where we're actually going to lose jobs. It's better to have a job than not to have one. Your wages are only going to go one way if you've lost your job, and of course that's going to have a devastating impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But back to this bill. I again commend Senator Roberts for his commitment and his approach. I look forward to continuing to work with him to find solutions to this problem. Unfortunately, what that lot over there have devised is not the answer. It's not actually going to bring the results that I know you're looking for, Senator Roberts—through you, Chair. But I really hope that we can get ourselves into a position where we can move things. Obviously, what's happening here with this government is going to set us back a long way, but we're going to have to work hard together to bring about sensible ideas and proposals that could really shake things up and shift things around. With that, I thank the Senate for the time and I thank Senator Roberts again for his commitment to this issue.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:51</span>):  I will start off by just thanking all the committee members who considered Senator Roberts's bill, the Fair Work Amendment (Equal Pay for Equal Work) Bill 2022, because it was a collegiate group talking through the pros and cons of the intentions of the bill. There are a number of us on the committee who have a serious concern about what's happening in this country with regard to the misuse of labour hire—not the essence of labour hire, because labour hire does appropriately have a place in the Australian economic market, but not as a means of decreasing wages and ripping people off. All of those discussions—and I include our deputy chair in this—were honest, open and frank discussions, and we also had the questioning of a number of witnesses. I am pleased to say that the Minerals Council of Australia turned up. They were a little bit displeased by having to appear before the Senate inquiry, considering that the mining industry are among the greatest abusers of the use of labour hire, and I'll go to some of those points in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But one of the things I find particularly disturbing from the opposition is that they haven't changed their tune, because they think there isn't a problem. In fact, when we started raising the issue of 'same job, same pay' many, many years ago, including through the Senate Select Committee on Job Security inquiry, they actually said that job insecurity and the abuse of labour hire in the Australian workforce was a made-up issue. They just can't get their minds around the fact that they have to hold to account those people in our economy who are exploiting Australian workers. So they decided, 'We'll just pretend it doesn't even exist; that way we don't have to pretend that we're taking any side,' whilst they were actually taking the side of big corporations that have been abusing labour hire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note some of the statistics that came out of that Senate Select Committee on Job Security inquiry. For example, the number of labour hire jobs in Australia has increased from 540,622 in 2013 to 797,710 in 2019, a 48 per cent increase in six years. The Queensland Coal Mining Board of Inquiry reported that in 1996 94.1 per cent of Queensland coalmine workers were directly employed. Today, just 50 per cent are, with the remainder being labour hire or contractors. BHP confirmed to the Senate Select Committee on Job Security that across their nationwide coal operations—get this—just 29.11 per cent of their staff are BHP employees. The rest are labour hire or contractors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the inquiry into this bill, there was also evidence given by Qantas in response to questions on notice that the Qantas Group has 17 subsidiaries that act as employing entities just for some of the areas such as cabin crew; tech crew; engineering; 'below the wing', which is ground handling; fleet presentation and catering; freight; and other frontline roles, which are described as 'above the wing', at airports. They had 21 external companies that they engaged, all in an attempt to artificially break up the bargaining process and the bargaining position of workers—gaming the system. Of course, we'll hear later today what we've heard now from the opposition that this is a made-up issue. We will hear that everything is fine and we don't need to change the IR legislation because—don't worry—Qantas have got the answer. They know how to drive wages down by not following 'same job, same pay' and by gaming the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The important thing about the intent of this bill was to look at some of those aspects in some of those industries that it could address. The committee did come to a view that there were some challenges in the bill and that the bill requires, and this question requires, further consultation. But, again, before I get into that, I think we should also make it clear that this isn't just about aviation workers and mine workers; it's other industries. In evidence given during the inquiry into job security over those 18 months in 2021 and before, a meat worker, Matt Journeaux, from the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At ACC there was a worker on labour hire working beside another worker, and there was a $500-a-week difference. We see labour hire companies not even paying the award in a lot of instances. Even if they do pay the award, typically our agreements would be 20 per cent or 30 per cent higher than the award, so those workers, even if they did receive the award rates of pay, would be on 20 per cent to 30 per cent less than what the local worker would be receiving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This included, of course, the Public Service. There 'wasn't a problem'—the government at the time, the now opposition, were very happy that there was no problem, because they were also paying labour hire workers substantially less than what was being paid to direct hire workers. Rather than giving people a career path and building our Public Service, they just treated labour hire as a cheap form of labour. Hardworking Australians doing their bit for the country were paid by our own government, the opposition now, substantially less.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A labour hire worker from the NDIA said: 'In my office, planners, despite doing the same job, were paid differently. When negotiations for contracts happened, we found out that other staff were being paid up to $10 more per hour. Pay for staff performing exactly the same role is often disparate, and many labour hire agencies prohibit their employees from discussing their pay, making it difficult to ask for parity.' That's one of the reasons why the government now has made it clear that misuse of labour hire is one of the direct policy changes that we're taking action on as we speak.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nick Thackray is a labour hire worker at the Australian Maritime Safety Authority—another example of misuse of labour hire for an area of expertise critical to maintain, within our national maritime safety. You'd think you would want to make sure that those people belonged and felt connected, but, no, the government at the time, now opposition, didn't give those workers one iota of concern because, don't forget, it was a 'made-up issue'—remember that continual parody from the now opposition, then in government? Nick Thackray from AMSA said in August 2021:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Obviously there's the difference in pay, but then we don't get sick leave, we don't get miscellaneous leave, we don't get carers leave and we don't get things like domestic violence leave. Or if somebody close to you dies, there's no leave like that. So essentially every day, depending on what's happening in your life, you make the choice, 'Am I going to get paid today?'—compared with what else is happening in your life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As far as the opposition are concerned, these are made-up issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee went through the issues that were raised in the inquiry into this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The increased use of labour hire, without particular reference to jobs performed or the duration of employment, appear to have blurred the distinction between labour hire employees and those permanently engaged by the host employer. Indeed, it may also be contributing to the underreporting of labour hire employee numbers, with many workers who have been persistently employed by labour hire firms identifying as employees of an industry, rather than a labour hire firm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After those substantial statistics about the massive increase in labour hire, it also says there is a very strong belief that there is an under-reporting of labour hire within the country. Of course, the committee supports the broad aim of the Fair Work Amendment (Equal Pay for Equal Work) Bill 2022 and ensuring that a labour-hire worker doing the same job as a directly engaged employee receives the same rate of pay, but the committee did recognise that any legislative response must be effective and operate as intended and that this requires further consideration. The committee also acknowledged the significant misgivings expressed by most inquiry participants about the limited scope of the bill and the lack of clarity concerning its key provisions and definitions. Whilst I go to some of the details and concerns about the bill—not the objective of the bill but the details of the bill—I also take into account the concerns that are raised again by those in the community. These aren't made-up people. These are real people giving real evidence. Anne Baker, Mayor of Isaac Regional Council, and Kelly Vea Vea, Deputy Mayor of Isaac Regional Council, said casual labour has always traditionally been engaged in the mining industry but usually for things like shutdown work and construction of new developments. No-one is saying it's not a new concept. What with have seen absolutely in the last 10 years is a huge increase. We've never expected to see casual jobs actually being put in place of permanent jobs. We have seen permanent jobs being made redundant and being replaced with casual labour. That's just something that we've witnessed over the last 10 years. It's not a made up issue. It's an issue of a great deal of concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why it was so important for the discussion on the bill to take place in the hearings with all those participating members who played a role in the consideration of this bill. Several stakeholders commented on the limited scope of the bill—for example, the ACTU was concerned that businesses could move employees onto contracting arrangements to remove the risk of being covered by the provisions of the bill. It argued that the labour-hire sector will no doubt swiftly evolve language in its contracts to move any employees onto contracting arrangements to greatly limit the risk of ever being captured by the terms of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might pause there for a moment. One of the things that's also critically important—and the government has foreshadowed this—is dealing with gig workers. Regulation of one part of the labour market also requires regulation of the other part of the labour market: the gig economy. Then we will see individual contracting where it's inappropriate as way of avoiding responsibility. I think that, over the last three and a half years, many in in place and many outside will have found that I'm a strong supporter of contract labour and the rights of contract labour. This is not about contractors not existing; this is about mechanisms being used to turn around gig work to go to the lowest common denominator. I don't mean the workers are the lowest common denominator; I mean their pay is being used and abused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite often it's not often the company that directly employs—though sometimes it is—but the company right at the top, which I describe as the economic employer, that makes economic demands for those companies down their supply chain to keep taking a section off by ratcheting down wages and conditions. Quite often, safety arrangements lost are lost in parallel. The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation noted this would be particularly relevant to carers and nurses working in aged care, who have historically had lower wages than their public and private acute counterparts. The ANMF also expressed significant concerns about the use of digital platforms and independent contractors in the aged-care sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the employer association for labour hire, the RCSA, warned that some businesses would find ways to circumvent any regulations. The RCSA, the employer group, argued that 'any equal-pay-for-equal-work scheme must consider how it can be applied across all forms of market activity relating to the provision of labour, not just to labour hire structures'. It noted that any regulation 'needs to adequately address the activity and behaviour, not the structure, if it is to have any real impact'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, while I support the concept of this bill, and it's important that the government continues to have conversations about same job, same pay, it also has to be run in parallel with what we do with the gig economy, because that means we actually are properly giving people minimum standards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some stakeholders were also concerned about the limited number of modern awards that would initially be covered by the bill. For example, Maurice Blackburn Lawyers argued that the bill offers no protection to workers in parts of the economy where labour hire arrangements are common, including construction, transport, hospitality, cleaning, and aged-care and disability-care services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast to the concerns about the bill's limited scope, some industry stakeholders raised concerns about the breadth of the proposed requirement for labour hire companies to provide additional payments based on the employee base rate of pay, including incentive allowances, such as overtime, penalty rates and other identifiable amounts. I think it would join many of us—other than the opposition—so we have a very clear position, and I think the intention of Senator Roberts's bill is to encompass those sorts of allowances to make sure that it is same job, same pay. I think there are a number of us in this chamber, including Senator Roberts, who see the importance of those issues being dealt with. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  I too thank Senator Roberts for bringing forward this bill, the Fair Work Amendment (Equal Pay for Equal Work) Bill 2022. I know that this has been an issue that Senator Roberts has spent a lot of time working on. I was on the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee in the last parliament, and I have to commend Senator Roberts for his tenacious questioning of the departments and the agencies that came before us. It was specifically to address—based on what he saw and the advice he got—certain inequalities in some of the awards, particularly the Black Coal Mining Industry Award. I note his interest in superannuation as well. I also note Senator Sheldon's true commitment to same job, same pay, and his ongoing commitment to addressing issues in the gig economy. So I thank Senator Sheldon for his contribution today, too. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the key issue is that this bill seeks a one-size-fits-all approach which overlooks the nuances in our labour hire industry that Senator Sheldon himself said has a place in our economy and a significant place in our workforce. We coalition senators note the work of the Senate Select Committee on Job Security and its establishment to inquire into this issue specifically and into the impact of insecure, precarious employment on the economy, wages, social cohesion, and workplace rights and conditions. That was a very wide ranging committee process. I thank everyone who participated in the committee for the comprehensive report that was raised. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one thing that I really want to focus on as I address the bill that is before us. While the bill in its current form is specifically applicable to labour hire employees under the Black Coal Mining Industry Award 2020 and the Aircraft Cabin Crew Award 2020, as well as four other awards that currently don't have provisions for casual employment, it also allows the minister to add awards by disallowable instrument as he sees fit. There was a whole chapter in the committee report dedicated to workforce arrangements in agriculture, and I want to focus on that. If this bill goes through as it is, it sets a precedent for a future minister to look at where else labour hire plays a significant role in meeting the needs of that workforce. Agriculture is one of those, as identified in the committee's own report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard about the increasing prevalence of labour hire in agricultural industries, specifically in the horticulture and the meat processing industries, which are inherently seasonal in their practice and inherently short term in their labour hire needs. I know blueberry growers who have full-time staff of about five, but during their harvest season—which can come on very rapidly, depending on weather conditions—they can have a call overnight and a need for employing up to 50 people on their farm to help them meet their harvest. You can't just fill those gaps through a SEEK ad or through an ad in the classifieds of the local paper—particularly as we thankfully have an Australian unemployment figure of three per cent, which is great news; that means there aren't that many Australians running around seeking employment. But these farmers and meat processors have developed agreements with labour hire companies who have, on their books, a large availability of workforce, and they play a significant role in helping us get the fruit and nuts off the trees, the vegetables off the ground and the meat into the packages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019 the committee heard that up to 56 per cent of labour carried out in those two industries alone—horticulture and meat processing—was carried out by contractors or other business operators such as labour hire companies. I want to remind people that horticulture is a $15-billion-a-year industry and meat processing is about $17 billion a year. These are not small parts of our economy; they're quite significant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry website shows that, in 2021-22, 60,000 to 70,000 people employed in horticulture alone were employed on a contract of some form. Some of these contracts are provided through our Pacific Australian Labour Mobility Scheme, which is a highly successful scheme. It is a two-way diplomatic relationship between Australia and those Pacific nations, with the communities from which that labour has come and the economic support they provide back to their families and their communities. Just yesterday I met with a group of young people from the Pacific Australian Emerging Leaders Summit, run by Micah Australia and the Pacific Conference of Churches. One of those young people was Remwatia Nokite, from Kiribati, and her key message to me was to thank Australia for making provisions under the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility Scheme that her family participates in that provides not only the economic security but also the opportunity for her family members, when they come here, to learn skills that they can then take home and apply when they go home. This is a scheme through which a lot of those visa holders come to us, or come to the end employer, through a labour hire company. My concern with this bill in its current format is it leaves the door open for uncertainty in the labour hire economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to raise the issue that, yes, while labour hire is a significant portion of our economy and it plays a strong role in our economy, contrary to some representations we've made in relation to labour hire and the broader workforce it is not at epidemic levels. According to the submission to the committee from the Australian Industry Group, only 1.1 per cent of the workforce is employed by a labour hire firm and this proportion is perhaps lower than it has been over the last 10 years. My point is that labour hire employees fill essential needs gaps across industries, including in the black coal industry, that meet market demand within the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other key point I want to make is that there are some employees who actively seek to be employed under a labour hire agreement because it provides them more flexibility than if they were employed under a full-term contract. So we need to ensure that we're not accidentally curtailing the rights of people to be employed under an arrangement that suits them and their families' needs. I do agree that Senator Roberts has seen an area that needs to be addressed, but this is not the solution.</span>

I rise in continuance on the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022. This is a bill that will deliver secure jobs and better pay for Australians. It's a bill that puts respect for women workers at the heart of our workplace laws. It's a bill that makes better wages a deliberate design feature of our government's agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is urgent, because working Australians deserve a better life right now. After 10 years of low wages as a design feature of economic policy of the previous government, we've seen a race to the bottom on wages and conditions across some of our most essential sectors, many of which are now facing unprecedented workforce shortages. These workers simply cannot afford to wait any longer, like early childhood educator Kylie Gray, who told me that if her wages don't improve soon she will have to leave the sector that she loves after 15 years simply because she is losing hope and she can't afford to stay. There are workers like security officer Pete Watkins, who has seen his wages fall over the past 10 years from seven per cent above the award back down to the award, all because security officers can't negotiate to protect wages across multiple employers today and they get undercut by dodgy security operators. Workers like Sheree Clark can't wait a day longer. She's been living in a caravan park, waiting for secure hours in her part-time contract in aged care—one of Australia's most essential sectors. She is waiting for secure hours so she can improve her income and sign a lease on a house. This is not how we should be treating our essential workers in Australia today. These workers can't afford to wait another day, let alone another 10 years, to see real change in their working lives.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our current industrial relations system is broken and outdated. It's based on an economy that doesn't exist anymore. It's based on an economy that looked very different from today, and it's a system that is no longer delivering for employers or for employees. It's a system that locks out thousands of workers from the benefits of bargaining. All work is valuable, and every worker deserves a chance to have a seat at the table where they can be heard, where their experience and expertise are recognised, and where their work is valued. What this bill isn't about is conflict. This is actually about balance and it's about respect. It's about respect for the voice of working Australians, like the essential workers I just spoke about. It's also about respect for the needs of business. This bill is about getting the balance right to build a strong and fair economy that benefits everyone.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just six months ago, we promised the people of Australia that if they elected Albanese Labor government we would get wages moving and we would deliver secure jobs. That's because we know that good, secure jobs mean better lives. We know that after 10 years of falling wages we can't afford wait another day. I'm proud that today we are getting on with the job: fixing a broken system, getting wages moving and delivering on our promise to deliver a better, brighter future based on good, secure jobs for all Australians. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:23</span>):  I'm speaking on a bill called the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022, but I reckon it should be renamed the 'Let's Give Union Bosses a Return On Their Investment in the Labor Party Bill 2022'. In terms of this new National Anti-Corruption Commission that has come into being, I wonder whether we're going to see a referral to the National Anti-Corruption Commission in relation to the relationship between the unions and the Labor Party. This bill actually isn't about higher wages, which we all support. This bill is about the Labor Party government giving a return on the investment that was put into the election of a Labor Party government by the unions. That is what this bill is all about. It is an acknowledgement that the Labor Party, which is defunct on the ground, won the election due to the campaigning strengths of the union movement as a political and campaigning movement. For that, the Labor Party has to return a favour to the union bosses, and that's what this bill is all about. It is about empowering union bosses. It's about empowering union thugs to go into small businesses across Australia and intimidate business owners, intimidate workers and threaten them, because that is the business model of the union movement.</span>

                    </a>  And that, as my colleague Senator Henderson has confirmed with her helpful contribution, is what John Setka, the thug of all thugs, has confirmed—we talk about first among equals; he is the thug among equals, the first thug I suppose—in relation to what he wants to see out of this Labor government, and that is a return on his investment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not for the interest of Australians. This is not for the interest of business owners and those who run businesses. This is all about the union movement. That is sad. Look at what is facing Australia at the moment. We are looking at a growing unemployment rate. We are looking at a growing inflation rate. We are looking at mortgage rates going up. This has all happened since May, by the way, for those who may be listening. It's all happened since the election of this Labor government because we all know that Labor will always cost you more. Labor is effectively bringing in a de facto federal payroll tax, because what it is saying to small businesses across Australia is that they have to pay anywhere between $14,000 or $15,000 and $80,000 to participate in relation to the provisions under this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Rhodes scholars opposite don't realise is that when you're a small-business owner you depend on the income from selling goods and services, but you also have your costs. If your costs are going to go up in one of your columns—for example, suddenly you've got to pay $70,000 or $80,000 to participate in negotiating wages and salaries for your employees because you're compelled to because you have union thugs on your doorstep—that means you actually, irony upon ironies, which the Rhodes scholar runners up over there don't realise, won't be able to afford to give people the pay rises that you want to give to them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The money will go into this great big black pot, this vortex. But the people who the left claim they want to stand up for and claim to represent are actually going to lose out under the provisions of this bill. It is very sad that the Mensa society members over there don't realise that because, and I cannot emphasise this enough, this is not about giving Australians higher wages and higher salaries. This bill is not about that. This bill is about empowering the union movement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at what has happened to the union movement in Queensland and Australia—I am a senator from Queensland—the Labor Party came out of the shearers' strike in western Queensland in the 1890s. You sometimes wonder what those genuine workers, those shearers, who wanted to have a political movement, would think about when they look at the modern Labor Party. Would they go: 'Really? Is this the movement that is supposed to represent working Australians today?' Of course it doesn't, because the Labor Party and the union movement's support for working-class Australians has disintegrated. They've been captured by the wokers. They've been captured by the trendy-dendies who like to live in the city and like to ride their bikes everywhere and claim to be all for public transport. They fail to understand that the reason that union membership in Australia has declined over the last 30 or 40 years from the 50, 60, 70 per cent of Australians who used to be members of unions is the failure of the union movement to stand up for working Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard my colleague say earlier today that the union membership at the moment is at about 14 per cent of the workforce. I actually thought it was a little bit lower. I think that within the private sector it's about 10 per cent. I think the 14 per cent takes into account those who are in the public sector. In the private sector—in small businesses, in medium businesses and in large businesses—only one in 10 Australians are members of a union. The other way of putting it is that 90 per cent of working Australians are not members of a union, yet we have this bill in front of us which is all about empowering union bosses and trying to arrest the decline of union membership. It's all about trying to ensure that union bosses can turn up on a small business's doorstep and force, threaten, cajole and bully workers to try and join a union. It is sad that one of the so-called key accomplishments of this government, in the six months that they've been in power, is going to be a bill that actually does nothing to increase the salaries and wages of working Australians, but instead increases the power of the union bosses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You should always look at what people say and then what they do. What is interesting is that when the Labor Party went to the election, this was very much a secret deal between the union movement and the Labor Party. Why I say that is that no-one knew about it. This was a secret deal that was locked away. It was clearly nutted out and probably signed with a handshake. I don't know, perhaps it was a spit in the hand type of handshake or a wink across the room between the Prime Minister and the union bosses to say that if you help us get elected we will repay the favour. We will repay the favour by bringing in pieces of legislation that will help the union movement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My opening comments about the National Anti-Corruption Commission weren't said in jest. They were actually quite serious. If there was a secret deal between the Labor Party and the union movement—in terms of cash for policy, campaign funds for policy, campaign funds for legislation—it's something that we should know. It is something that should have been put on the table before the election. It wasn't. It was secret. Therefore, what else is in this deal between the Labor Party and the union movement? What else is there?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can talk about what the Labor Party are going to do, for example, in relation to electoral reform. We all know that the Labor Party depend on the union movement, so they're going to bring forward reforms that will put a cap on expenditure. They are going to bring in a financial gerrymander—the Queensland model. They'll bring that in here federally. It will effectively remove the fairness that exists between political parties at a federal level, between those on the Left and the Right, and ensure that there is a financial gerrymander that favours the parties on the Left. You can only look at Queensland where political parties are capped at $15 million each for their electoral expenditure but unions are capped at $10 million. There are 26 unions in Queensland. Twenty-six times 10 is 260. So unions can spend $260 million in an election in Queensland, plus the Labor Party's $15 million. The LNP, my party, the party of the grassroots, will be out spent 20 to one. That is not fair. Whatever your views may be of the left and right of politics, we should all believe that there should be a fairness between the left and the right in terms of how they participate or are stopped from participating, how they are encouraged to participate in Australia's democracy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are seeing here is what happened in Queensland, the financial gerrymander that effectively locks the LNP out, is that Labor through this bill is ensuring that come the next federal election they will be able to go to their union bosses and say, 'We delivered this piece of legislation; we helped entrench and empower union bosses'—not unions, but union bosses—'in Australia's industrial and political system; therefore we need you to make sure that you come out under the changes that we've made to election expenditure rules at a federal level and campaign vigorously against the election of the Liberal National Party.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why this is of most concern. This bill is not about helping working Australians. This bill is not about helping small businesses. This bill is cash for policy at its most base. It is bordering on corruption in terms of the payback between the Labor Party and the union movement. This bill was not taken to the election. This bill was a secret deal between the Labor Party and the union movement, not to assist working-class Australians. It was all about helping the union movement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to those business organisations: let this be a lesson to you. You thought you could sit down and deal with this Labor Party, and this shows that the Labor Party played you. This shows that for those of you who went along to that summit—by the way, they had a band that summit they had here a couple of months ago, and they paid $7,000. The Labor party used taxpayers' money to pay for a band that cost $7,000—good on the band, we all love live music—at a summit talking about how the Labor Party can entrench itself in power. These business organisations went along and sat there and nodded their heads and said, 'Yes, we can do a deal, we will work together, let's go back to the Keating-Hawke tripartite arrangement.' Of course that didn't happen. The Labor Party and the union movement took you like a hot dinner and are still eating you up and asking for seconds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to those acronyms out there who represent businesses across Australia: stand up. Stop your wittering and whingeing. Stop your complaining. Stand up and join the fight against this Labor Party. What is happening this week in the six months of this government shows overreach. The overreach that normally happens in the third or fourth term of the government is happening at six months. So just imagine what is going to happen in the new year. So join the fight and stand up for small businesses.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022. There have been extensive negotiations on this bill by the Australian Greens, led by our leader, Adam Bandt, and my wonderful colleague Senator Pocock here. We think that there are going to be, in amendment, some important changes that are going to improve this bill overall. Overall, the Australian Greens think the bill is an in credibly important bit of legislation which will result in better conditions and, as the bill says, secure jobs and better pay for workers, particularly some of the amendments working on making sure that the better off overall test actually does mean better off overall for all workers, and increasing things like the ability to access unpaid parental leave. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A central rationale for this bill, which the Greens support and which has been put forward by government, has been the need to increase wages. We support that and we agree. But we also believe that in the middle of the cost-of-living crisis that we are facing government needs to also do more about raising the rate of income support. I want to focus in my speech today on the link between the benefits of raising the rate of income support and how that then flows and feeds into better jobs, better pay and more secure work for workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Inadequate income support means that, currently, if you're on the JobSeeker allowance then you get income support at the rate of $48 a day, which is not enough to live on by a long shot. The cost of living now means that the estimate of what you need not to be living in poverty is $88 a day, and yet JobSeeker only gives you $48 a day. The idea of course—and people say this—is that people don't want to be on JobSeeker for long periods of time. But a lot of people are. People are also on JobSeeker and do part-time or casual work. That's all they have access to, or it might be all that they're capable of doing because of health issues, but they boost their income by doing small amounts of work. But at the moment, if you do those small amounts of work then you can only earn an extra $75 a week, or $10 a day, before your JobSeeker payment starts cutting out at the rate of 50c in the dollar. That's a 50 per cent marginal tax rate for people on the lowest incomes in this country. And you only need to earn $1,300 a fortnight, or $92 a day, when your JobSeeker rate cuts out entirely.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Henderson poverty line shows that what you need not to be living in poverty is $88 a day, and yet JobSeeker cuts out completely if you earn only $92 a day. I've spoken many times in this chamber about the benefits to people of increasing the rate of JobSeeker, and I'll go into that again in this speech. But in terms of the nexus between the rate of JobSeeker and better pay and jobs for people, this undercuts that drastically. If you can only earn $92 a day before your income support cuts out entirely then that sets up the conditions for people working on the black market, people working cash in hand and people accepting really exploitative conditions which aren't in the formal job market, because they desperately need the money to survive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That undercuts drastically our whole industrial relations framework, because you then have one unscrupulous employer who is paying people at way below the award rate, or below the rates that have been bargained for in enterprise bargains, because those people are desperate to get that money—and this is without any of the checks and balances of our industrial relations system. That's versus other employers who are trying to do the right thing by paying people properly and providing the right conditions; they can't compete against unscrupulous employers. So raising the rate of income support, in and of itself, is going to be an incredibly important mechanism to increase wages, to make sure that people who are working are being paid an appropriate amount for the value of their labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as having people living in absolute abject poverty on income support being bad for workers it's also incredibly bad for the people who have to survive on that. They need to get by while living in that quagmire of poverty. We know that the current rate is inadequate and we know that it has been inadequate for years. We've heard that from the community and from politicians. The community has told politicians clearly that the payment rate is inadequate. We know that people have to make really incredibly difficult choices about whether they pay the rent, pay for food or pay their medical bills. They're choosing between seeing a doctor or keeping the heating on. And people who are facing domestic violence, homelessness and many other challenges are trapped by a payment that is far too low.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as hearing it directly from community members, we've heard it directly from the peak bodies across multiple sectors—the same ones who are supporting this legislation before us today. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Council the Social Services have all, at different points, acknowledged the need to raise the rate, and urgently.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share two stories with you today from people who have been forced to rely on income support payments. They will also give you an example of how living on inadequate income support reduces their ability to engage in paid work. If we are serious about getting people work, supporting people to be in work and supporting people to be able to move into paid employment, we need to be reducing the rate of income support as well as doing all of the important measures that are in this bill. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have been living in poverty on Centrelink payments, Austudy, Newstart and JobSeeker since leaving high school almost nine years back. I have never been able to afford housing that meets my needs as a disabled person with trauma from multiple domestic violence situations from various cohabitors. I can barely afford anywhere to live at all, actually, and the fact that I am once again likely having to find a place to live with current prices within my greater area starting at 70 per cent of the full JobSeeker payment is soul crushing. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I spend hundreds of dollars a month on medication and medical equipment I need to live on a day-to-day basis. I can't afford to see specialists for things like my ADHD or autism. I can barely afford basic foods. Almost any meat I buy is nearly off, any veg frozen, any snack half price or made from scratch. Almost all of my money goes directly to rent, bills, food and medical. The paltry leftovers aren't enough to keep my car on the road. I have to ask for help pretty much each year to cover  CTP et cetera. (Also, almost every job I have ever applied for has specifically stated that applicants need a car, so people on JobSeeker are literally priced out of being able to work.) New clothes are cast-offs from friends or the clearance section at an already cheap store. I have never been able to buy my own phone—which, by the way, is needed just to access Centrelink payments, and an up-to-date phone with reasonable technical specs is a necessity for the vast majority of jobs I've worked or applied for. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">COVID supplements—which merely raised me to around the poverty line, not even properly out of poverty—changed how I could live and feel for about a year. I didn't have to count every cent to make sure it would last two weeks till next pay. I was able to get medical care I desperately needed to get but couldn't before afford. Even then, though, I had to rely on the goodwill of the specialists to charge much less than the usual rates. I could afford car service and registration without having to beg others for help. I felt vaguely human and part of society for a brief time. My mental health, despite the turmoil of the time, had never been better. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to continue to take the medications that allow me to get up of a morning and do anything other than stare into the distance. I'd like to be able to afford taking any of the jobs I have been applying for, in industries important to Australia but currently struggling for workers. I would like to be able to afford glasses that don't give me a headache. I'd like to be able to afford chicken that I don't have to immediately take home and sniff and hope it's not gone bad. I'd like a lot of things that you and so many take for granted as part of your everyday lives and would cost you and Australia so very little. I just want to be human again. Is that so much to ask?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, I am completely burned out and have been for at least five years. Five years ago, I had a 15-year-old in and out of hospital and in a wheelchair. I also had a 13-year-old living with ME/CFS and at school part-time, when he wasn't getting a cold that left him in bed for six weeks at a time. As a single parent, I was also working 30 hours a week, twice the number of hours required, yet still needing income support. I had a breakdown that year and have never recovered. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say thank you to all the advocates who have been fighting to raise the rate of income support. We hear you, and we will keep fighting for change.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Miranda and the others have told us, there is clear evidence that things can be better and clear evidence that raising the rate of income support is critically important for secure jobs and better wages for workers. For a decade, the Liberals left the payment rate below the poverty line, but for a brief window with the COVID supplement we saw how things could be different. People spoke about the differences that being able to afford food and a safe place to stay made in their lives. People could afford their medical bills and their energy bills. Research showed that the COVID supplement halved the rate of poverty in Australia. Particularly, it also showed that more people were able to enter the job market. More people were actually able to get work during COVID because of the increased rate of income support. It shows again that connection between work and actually supporting people who are out of work on JobSeeker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That experience in the midst of a crisis showed us that there can be a different way. We can raise the rate of income support and meaningfully reduce poverty and increase conditions and better jobs for workers in Australia. This is an approach that the Greens have constantly advocated for. I do want to, again, acknowledge the important work of my predecessor in my portfolio, Senator Rachel Siewert, over many years, particularly her work chairing the inquiry into the adequacy of Newstart and related payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We included a commitment to raise the rate of JobSeeker in our election platform with a clear, costed policy. The Labor Party have been reluctant to do this and are yet to put forward one of their own. At the same time, they have been carrying forward the Scott Morrison stage 3 tax cuts and insisting on giving $250 billion over the decade to the ultra-wealthy. We put forward clear amendments to a bill that recently passed through this place, and I thank Senator David Pocock for his support of those amendments. I also want to thank Senator David Pocock for his important advocacy during the negotiations on this bill for the need to raise the rate and for pushing the government to act. If the commitment put forward by the Labor Party as part of the negotiations over this bill does lead to a meaningful increase in the rate of JobSeeker, then we will welcome it. But there can't be an excuse for further inaction and delaying action, because people are living in poverty now. The skyrocketing cost of living is real now. We need to have an increase in the rate now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To wrap up, as my colleagues have indicated, and as I said at the beginning of my speech, the Greens are supporting this bill. We will also continue to actively advocate for an increase to the rate of JobSeeker. If the government's commitment as part of those negations leads to meaningful change, we will welcome it, but it cannot be an excuse for inaction. We will continue to push for a guaranteed liveable income so that there is genuine support for everyone who needs it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AOL" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COLBECK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  I rise to make my contribution to this piece of legislation, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022. The reason that this legislation is so contested is that it will have a significant impact on the IR landscape in Australia—quite frankly, in a negative way. We have already had small businesses and medium-sized businesses saying that they've got unions on their doorstep and they're being threatened by the unions. This bill isn't about the workforce and workers in this country, as the Labor Party spin machine would have us all believe. It's a union life-support bill. It's about providing power back to the union movement. With private sector union membership sinking to somewhere around 10 per cent or less, unions are seeking a way back, and the government is providing it to them through this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses are already telling me they're being threatened by unions and being told that this legislation gives the unions the opportunity to go after non-union workplaces. We know that—businesses that have been working cooperatively to create arrangements for their workforce and are seeking to expand their workforce. We all know that there's a workforce shortage in this country right now, and so the bargaining power actually is with workers. Businesses are seeking good workers, good employees, because that's important for their businesses. And we are seeing a growth in wages across this country because of the balance of the market in Australia. We are seeing a growth in wages. The Labor Party wants to dismiss that reality, that fact, but everywhere I go, in every workplace that I talk to, they are all looking for workers, and they're all willing to pay for workers who will work hard for them and provide strong productivity. But the non-union businesses are also telling me that the unions see this legislation as a ticket to come after them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So don't be fooled by the rhetoric from Labor. This legislation is about reinvigorating union power. It's not about workforce. The objective is to drive up union membership by standing over workers in businesses and in industry—and driving up Labor Party revenues, quite frankly, through the union movement. How do we know that for sure? The CFMMEU have belled the cat. John Setka's out there, and he has said he looks forward to having the power to go after non-union sites. I can tell you that people I know in the building industry, including in the fit-out sector of the construction industry, are hearing that all over Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During my time in the construction industry, I remember seeing the impact of pattern bargaining across that industry and understanding the impact that had on inflationary forces. Effectively, Labor are sending us back to those bad old days of the seventies and eighties, when the unions threatened subcontractors and disrupted building sites. So, when the Labor Party tell us about driving more affordable housing, they're kidding themselves. They're kidding themselves when you think about what the impacts of this legislation are going to be on the construction industry in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor say that this legislation is about delivering an election commitment. The Labor Party did go to the election saying they wanted to get wages moving again. They did say that. But they didn't say that they were going to introduce legislation to bring unions back into businesses across the country and to give unions the opportunity to attack small business across the country and drag them into processes that they don't necessarily want to be a part of. No wonder Labor want to ram this legislation through the parliament with a truncated Senate committee process and deals on the side with the crossbench. They really don't want the scrutiny that they should have and that this legislation deserves, given the impact it will have on the Australian economy. They want to ram it through before Christmas so that their union mates can get straight into businesses across the country and so that they can deliver on their backdoor, secret deal with the union movement at the expense of Australian business and the Australian economy. So much for a fairer, kinder, more open parliament and process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously I'll allow that the Prime Minister sent out the memo. They didn't read it, and they're not living by it. In reality, though, there is one question that sits with this legislation: why would Australian workers trust Labor with their industrial relations? Labor make out that they are the party of the worker, but increasingly we're seeing that that's not the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that the legislation that this is amending and replacing is legislation that was brought into being by the Labor Party under former Prime Minister Julia Gillard when she was minister for industrial relations, to replace the legislation that was in place before that. That was after a period of time, I might add, when wages did see strong growth: during the Howard years. Go back and have a look at the numbers. You will see strong growth in wages in relation to the economy during the Howard years. You will see strong growth in the economy and good economic management from a coalition government, alongside strong growth in wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers in this country have been working to this framework since 2009, when the Labor Party's system came into place. From the Labor Party's legislation, Fair Work Australia have been oversighting the system with Labor's hand-picked people, who have been assessing wage claims and wage increases since that legislation came into place. All Labor's legislation, all Labor's hand-picked people, have been in place since 2009, and that process has driven the outcomes that we've seen over the last decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was that process, every time the coalition sought to amend the Fair Work Act, even during COVID. The cry came from the other side, 'Here we go again with Work Choices.' They were not prepared to amend the legislation. They were not prepared to consider things that had even been agreed with workers, with unions and with employers. They were not prepared to agree to those things. They knocked them back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be really frank about this. The industrial relations framework that has been providing oversight to workers' wages over the last decade is Labor's. They want to blame the coalition for everything. That's their mantra: deflect any responsibility; blame somebody else. They do not stand up and take appropriate responsibility for their own actions. But let's be fair dinkum about this. This is Labor legislation, passed in 2009 and amended a couple of times, for a new modern award system. To quote the Prime Minister of the time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Fair Work Act delivers on the Rudd Government's promise for fair and balanced laws that will allow workplaces to become more productive and competitive without stripping away basic pay and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Fair Work Act has enterprise bargaining, in good faith, at its heart. Enterprise level bargaining will be the primary means of driving future workplace improvements and productivity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on. The media release from the Hon. Julia Gillard MP on 1 July 2009 says:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new workplace relations system is designed to balance the needs of employees and employers to ensure Australia is competitive and prosperous, without taking away basic employment rights and guaranteed minimum standards.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when the Labor Party says the workplace system is broken: who broke it? The legislation is effectively the same as they introduced and that came into effect in 2009. So, why would any worker in this country trust Labor now?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not about workers. This legislation is not about workers; it's about union power. We all know it. We understand it. And the unions know it, because—helpfully for us and unhelpfully for the government—John Setka belled the cat. This allows him and his mates to go after non-union sites. At the same time, the government are stripping away the ABCC, which provided some oversight to that. They say that it was all about stickers on hats and things of that nature, but we know and we've seen the outrageous, disgraceful things the CFMMEU have been penalised for, have been fined hundreds of thousands of dollars for. You don't get fined hundreds of thousands of dollars for flags on cranes and stickers on hats. That is a complete and utter cop-out, and any person on the government side who tries to run that tripe should be ashamed of themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a statement in the parliament this morning about the Jenkins review. Yet people on the other side stand up and try to make the claim that the ABCC is just about stickers on hats. Some of the disgraceful things, which I won't try to repeat in this place but have been debated in this place before, are the sorts of things the ABCC should be addressing. At the same time that they're letting the unions back in they're taking off the oversight and controls of some of the more-outrageous elements of the union movement. They should be ashamed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition will support fair and reasonable workplace relations. We want to see Australians earning a good living. We are concerned, as the Labor Party say they are, about the cost of living. We wanted to make some sensible changes to the Workplace Relations Act while we were in government, and Labor opposed it, with the Greens—not surprising. But here we are, a bit over a decade after the current act came into place, put in place by Labor, and Labor say we should trust them with the industrial relations system—their legislation, their hand-picked people in Fair work Australia, making the decisions about Australian workers' wages—and try to blame us for the impact on wages. It's all in their lap. Why should Australian workers trust them now?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we know this is about union power, and they're taking away other provisions of oversight of the union movement at the same time that they're doing this. At a time of high inflation we will see—because the businesses are already telling us—that the unions are tapping on the door, and we're going to see more disruption in workplaces, because the unions have more power, which has been provided to them by this legislation. And Labor will do what they've done before. They don't know how to manage money. They don't know how to manage the economy. And they will continue to contribute to the worsening situation in relation to inflation in this country. We've seen it before, unfortunately. I had to live through it during the seventies and the eighties in the building industry. And we're going to see it again.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia and to the workers and small businesses of our nation, I want to firstly thank the minister's staff and the departmental staff for their briefings. I want to thank the many companies, unions, employer entities and workers. We listened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hawke-Keating years broke the previous harsh, adversarial, mutually assured destruction policy in industrial relations in this country. Then we went back with the Fair Work Act from Julia Gillard in 2009—complex, prescriptive. The creators of this act do not understand industrial relations. A senior practical Labor MP whom I regard very highly said that Gillard's Fair Work Act was a 'backward step', damaging Australia. It's failed. Many want it changed. I know that union bosses like David Noonan and Michael Ravbar, for whom I have some regard, and Alex Bukarica and the ETU's Michael Wright say that we need to change, that we need to get back to basics. Employer and industry groups say the same. Parliamentarians in this chamber say the same. How hard is it for workers to know their entitlements with this? It's impossible. How hard is it to run a small business these days? It's very difficult. This thing justifies the industrial relations club's existence. Workers now kowtow to the industrial relations club.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go back to basics. Unions were formed in the 19th century to protect workplace basics; to protect pay, safety, entitlements, job security, retirement; to ensure fairness; and to strengthen workers' bargaining power. Then we got laws to protect state and federal workers. Unions were doing a vital job. Politically they were omitted from being held accountable the way other organisations and company directors were. After successful union campaigns, governments legislated worker protections in employment, safety, industry and health legislation. Unions were no longer needed for those basic protections because they were enshrined in legislation, yet they had immunity from many provisions under the law and were effectively monopolies, with no competition among unions within industries. As with all monopolies, this was the result of government legislation. As with all monopolies, they faced no accountability from competitors. As with all monopolies, some union bosses abused this privilege.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years, in this cosy life with no competition and no accountability, we saw abuses in the HSU, the SDA, the AWU and the CFMMEU in which union bosses stole workers' money for personal, financial and other benefits, including brothels. In the 1990s I was good friends with Jim Lambley, the then CFMEU vice-president. He shared with me his thoughts that the union, which was once strong and powerful and genuinely committed to miners, was sloppy and not providing a service to its members. Times had changed; it needed to lift its game because traditional services were already legislated. As a result of neglect of union members, union membership in the private sector outside the Public Service is just nine per cent and falling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not all large unions have a monopoly or bosses that want to exploit them. I single out and compliment the TWU. They've had turmoil, just like every entity, but they've sorted themselves out. They're represented here by Senator Sheldon and Senator Sterle—excellent advocates for the trade union movement, excellent advocates for workers, excellent advocates for Australians. One of the reasons is that the TWU contains not only employees and truck drivers but small businesses. The TWU is the largest entity with the largest membership of small businesses in this country. They work together to provide a service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was going to discuss the sheer abuse and exploitation of people in the Hunter Valley at the hands of the CFMMEU, combined with BHP, combined with Chandler Macleod, which is part of Recruit Holdings from Japan, the largest labour hire company in the world. Instead, I will ask a few questions of anyone watching today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor titles its bill the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill. Let me give you facts and ask you what you think. Firstly, the new bill omits any hint at the Fair Work Amendment (Equal Pay for Equal Work) Bill, my bill that has been pushed for months now and which aims to lift casual pay rates. Why? The Senate committee of inquiry agreed on the need for my bill. They said, 'Let's wait for Labor's version,' but it's not in the bill that we see before us. My bill is ready to go, with certain awards that found no issues with it. How long do abused miners and airline staff need to wait? Let's get the experience before widening it. Why not include my bill in this? We've researched it thoroughly. I asked last week and the minister's staff said, 'They've barely started consultation.' Then they did so with the perpetrators of the heinous acts in the Hunter Valley and Central Queensland. They're not interested in better pay. They're not interested, and they've done nothing to include it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at job security. Well, look at COVID mismanagement; the phasing out of the coal industry and jobs under the Liberals, Nationals and Labor; the erosion of our rights and freedoms under COVID mismanagement; increasing energy prices; killing manufacturing and hurting agriculture; the lack of much-needed tax reform and much-needed economic reform; increasing debt; work health and safety systems being bypassed; Australia's productive capacity being destroyed; the failure of our industrial relations systems and more; tax reform; high immigration flooding in and putting downward pressure on wages; and inflation. They're not interested in job security at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then let's have a look at the summit. It was a sham. It was not a genuine, Paul Keating-style consultation. The government knew beforehand what they were going to do after the summit. The key items in this bill that they've now got in front of us in the chamber were not even raised in the summit topics. I wrote to Joel Fitzgibbon, the previous member for Hunter, on the abuses in the Hunter valley, and he refused to reply to me. It was the same with his replacement, Dan Repacholi, and the same with Minister Burke. They are not interested in job security, fairness or the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we've got a bill before us that is another 249 pages plus government amendments—150 amendments to their own bill in the lower house. That's another 34 pages. They're going to add more complexity, make it thicker, make it more difficult for people to understand. These 150 amendments confirm that the bill was hastily introduced and not thought through. If there are so many amendments needed and so many flaws can be identified in such a short time, how many will implementation in the real world expose, and who will pay for that? Workers will pay for that. Small business will pay for that. This is so flawed the government is making amendments to its own amendments!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a spit-and-hope bill. When the Australian Building and Construction Commission was introduced, there were months of consultation. When it was abolished, there was none. The same should apply to the whole bill. It needs debate. It needs to be deferred and considered properly. Who pays for this mess? The people: union members, small businesses, workers, communities and the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the bill now. There are 27 parts, 13 substantive. Some are simply tidying, and that is good. Some are worthy improvements—minor but worthy—and that is good. Some big issues are not thought through. Some big issues have been thought through yet deceptively hidden because they don't want the people to see them. Some issues were designed deliberately to confuse and to obfuscate. All is slapped behind the false labelling of enabling a pay rise and more secure jobs. This is what you get out of the south end of a north-facing bull. There is no mandate for stuff that's been hidden—no mandate at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 22 November 2022, Minister for Small Business Julie Collins failed to answer two core questions: how many small businesses will be drawn into wage bargaining and how much it will cost. They added another definition to the already 140 definitions of 'small business' across government departments. The government tells the people of Australia that the whole rationale behind this bill is to get wages moving, yet there's no specific detail: how, when, who? There is nothing concrete, just broad, fluffy statements, typical of the Labor-Greens-teal coalition governing the Senate. Labor claims it will improve the bargaining position of small business and workers, so why do thousands of small businesses oppose it? Could it be due to this?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are union bosses given the power of veto to frustrate the bargaining process? Even if employees agree with the employer, they still can be vetoed by remote union bosses. Why are smaller employers locked into a process they do not support if they have a head count of more than 19 people, including those who choose to work only a few hours a week? Why isn't the full-time equivalent used? As a result, large businesses can negotiate conditions smaller businesses cannot compete with. That aids large businesses to kill off smaller competitors, leading to fewer jobs, plus small businesses lack the resources to deal with the red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission illustrates the government's aims and intent: rewarding union bosses with power. That's what's behind this bill. It means a return to the damaging days of industrial thuggery. Remember the BLF? The Dyson Heydon royal commission revealed so much thuggery in the CFMEU. There were court cases and criminal convictions. The ABCC worked. Labor abolished it. The coalition reintroduced it. Labor is now abolishing it. There were millions of dollars in fines. What will happen to them? There was violent behaviour, industrial blackmail, killing small businesses and restrictive work practices that cost taxpayers an additional 30 per cent on building costs. Who's going to enforce the law now?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will in the long run harm unions. It gives more power to union bosses over members and industry and generally in the community. Monopolies discourage responsibility and competitiveness of service and they reduce accountability. This bill entrenches the monopoly and makes it stronger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unions may receive a short-term boost, yet, long term, it will accelerate, sadly, the slide of declining union membership. Look in Queensland. Premier Palaszczuk aims to kill the Red Union. She is protecting the Queensland nursing union, who are big donors to Labor. She is trying to kill the Red Union, which is starting freely, because she wants to kill any competition to her union bosses that donate. This is not about higher pay and job security; it's about giving union bosses power over industries, over companies and employers and over workers. Instead of returning to the pre-Hawke days, we need the reverse. We need to restore the primacy of the workplace, the employer/employee relationship, with employees free to bring in unions when they choose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big picture is that industrial relations needs comprehensive reform. We need to get away from the industrial relations adversarial approach that has plagued this country. It locks managements, executives, union bosses, consultants and lawyers into industrial relations games and not into improving businesses. Instead of having the brightest and best lawyers and accountants focused on how we can smash the opposition in this country, we need to focus on how we can smash the opposition in South Korea and Japan and China. They are our overseas competitors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industrial relations reform needs to be comprehensive, focus on the primacy of the employer/employee relationship and return to the days of Hawke-Keating, at least for a start. People need to focus on their business, not the corporation. Always around the world in workplaces people are focused on their workplace—that's what people love. We need industrial relations reform that develops responsibility for the business. We need a short bill, instead of this monstrosity. We need about 20 pages of basic entitlements, and, instead of getting off the hook through lawyers with this monstrosity, we need clear provisions so that, if these basic provisions are violated, people go to jail. Workers are getting abused in this country. Small businesses are getting abused in this country. We need simple provisions and severe penalties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's consider the teals—David Pocock as a teal and the Labor-Greens-teal governing coalition. The governing coalition in this Senate is Labor-Greens-teal. Fifteen amendments he announced on Sunday. The government was going to do nine anyway! Four are corrections and another four are corrections to government oversights in the bill! The JobSeeker rate is irrelevant to the bill—horse trading! That leaves one amendment that Senator Pocock initiated. Union bosses will still be able to drag small business into multi-employer bargaining, and to get out of multi-employer bargaining those businesses will have to engage in expensive litigation. Welcome to the new Labor-Greens-teal coalition running this country, where the love of power is more important!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, instead of the lies and pretence of this bill, we need honesty. Instead of boosting union bosses' power, we need to make the employer/employee workplace relationship the focus to get Australia's talent to the fore and to make us competitive again. Instead of adding more complexity and regulations, we need comprehensive industrial relations reform—simplicity, honesty, efficiency and real protection. This mess bypasses protections and leaves workers vulnerable and exposed. Above this building, we have one flag. We are one community, we are one nation and we work like hell to protect workers, protect small business and restore honesty in governance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also rise to speak vehemently against this bill as the shadow minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development. This bill will have profound impact on the construction industry, which underpins our infrastructure build across the country; on the transport industry, on our roads, our ports, our airports; and, indeed, on regional development. We know that the majority of country towns and regional capitals are built and sustained by small to medium-sized enterprises. They're the enterprises that the Labor Party and union mates are after. They've already got a big hold in the big businesses. Where they lack a hold and a sway is in those small family-owned enterprises right across the country. The target of these changes are 2.6 million small businesses across this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard senators right across my side of the chamber talk about the rush to get this done and the mistakes that the Labor Party have made on the way to getting that done—150 amendments to their own legislation. They had the drafting pen. They had all the bureaucrats. They had all the legal experts in the department to get it right but they didn't. One hundred and fifty amendments to their own bill, before it gets to the Senate, and a few odd, minor changes by Senator Pocock and here we are—very, very chaotic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are they in such a rush, Senator Cadell? Why? Do you know what I think it is? I think you've got to pay the ferryman sometimes. This is more about making sure Sally McManus and the ACTU have a very, very merry Christmas, thank you very much—as if an election of an Albanese government wasn't enough for them in to 2022. It's to ensure that Sally McManus can go on an extended Christmas holiday with a big smile on her face knowing she has secured changes—through this Labor government reaching into family-owned and run enterprises right across the country—that will wreak havoc on our productivity, that won't raise wages in the way that has been talked about here today. It is not a bill that you had a mandate for. In fact, during the election campaign the Treasurer explicitly ruled out measures that are covered in this bill, and yet here we are, a mere six months later, seeking to legislate the most draconian wind back of industrial relations in this country in 40 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister waltzes around. 'I'm the new Hawke.' He has got the voice happening. He's the new Keating. He's nowhere near the reforming nature that the Hawke and Keating government put our economy on for the future. This will be a drag on our economic productivity. It's not just me saying it; it's all the small to medium enterprises, and industry, that are saying it. It is not a policy that has been endorsed by the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at what industry has been saying about the impact of this bill they've been absolutely scathing. 'It will be back to the future for our Australian ports.' Who wants to go back to where farmers and small business people are having punch-ups with unions at ports? That is actually what used to happen in this country, because of the severe and radical industrial reaction from unions. This is exactly where this bill will be taking us back to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, in its arrogance, has no interest in allowing the proper time for examination of the implications of these proposed reforms. Their arrogance is compounded by the raft of amendments and the latest changes negotiated on the fly.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will have a significant impact on my portfolio area. It's Master Builders Australia's submission that has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the bill will see a return to industry-wide pattern deals and entrench sector-wide strike action that will be damaging to workplaces and the broader Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't believe them. We've heard a lot of talk about the feminised workforces and low-paid workers. In the construction industry that's an area of the Australian economy where there have been wage rises going forward. You cannot find a chippie for love nor money. And rightfully when something's in short supply the cost of it goes up. In the construction industry and in the transport industry that flat rate of wage has not actually been occurring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industries, such as the construction industry, don't operate in a silo. It is part of an intricate supply chain. Think of concrete. If it doesn't get there on time you delay the entire trajectory of that project—whether it's your backyard patio, or whether it is a major construction project in a capital city that will have benefits to the broader community and productivity across the economy. They aren't carved out like the construction industry is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary: the Master Builders have said that this bill removes the 'enterprise' from enterprise bargaining, removes 'agreement' from enterprise agreements and gives unions more say than workers. And that has to be a bad thing! Unions and the Labor Party say they're about workers, so why don't the working people vote for you? The National Party actually represents those in this country who are on the lowest median income levels. And do you know what? You are so non-competitive in our seats because the workers across Australia know that you do not stand up for them. You are much more interested, as we saw in the latest Victorian election, about fighting for the high-income earners in capital cities against your Green fellows than in actually sticking up for the workers in this country, those who are on low incomes and in vulnerable workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at what else the Master Builders talked about, they made the point that businesses don't work in an economic silo. There has been a whole song and dance around this place about, 'We've carved out the construction industry and the CFMMEU has nothing to do with it anymore.' That is not the case. If industries like shipping, transport, warehousing and logistics are adversely impacted by multi-employer bargaining then so too will the construction industry be. If there are port strikes or transport strikes, they will impact on the construction industry. It is false to come in here and say otherwise. Independent modelling from the Master Builders indicates that this policy to abolish the ABCC, which other senators have spoken about, will cost the economy $47½ billion by 2030. That's a hell of a lot of roads, hospitals and schools which could be built.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are we abolishing the ABCC? It's not because they weren't doing their job and not because they weren't standing up to the sexist CFMMEU, which so many of you are here as a result of—they use your skirts to hide behind. It's the ABCC which is actually calling out the sexism and the brutality that occurs on construction sites right across this country. And do you know what? You want it abolished! That's not because it's taking the CFMMEU to court, and winning cases—which is pretty tough to do—but because this is a deal you've done to get here. Those are the facts of the business that you are in on the other side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the most impartial observer can see that these reforms are heavily weighted to the benefit of the government's union mates rather than to the transport portfolio that I represent. Just briefly, in the time left to me, I want to go to the impact both on the aviation and shipping industries, which have not been carved out. As an island nation, nothing gets into this country without coming from somewhere else and arriving, mainly, at our ports. So if our ports are not efficient or productive then we all pay, right across our economy. I have been quite concerned about the fact that ports are going to be subjected to significant impacts in the workplace. They're critical to our supply chain efforts, the fragility of which were exposed to during COVID. Some examples: Svitzer, for instance, does a lot of the tugboating in this country, and they were forced to lock the gates due to the failure of both sides to reach an agreement. On day one, there would have been only 20 days left of fuel supply for the nation. That's not just for cars and trucks but for airlines. So if you're wondering, 'What do ports have to do with me, I don't own a yacht?' you don't have to. Ports are important to you because if they shut down for a couple of days then we run out of fuel. In a country like Australia, as diversely populated as we are, that has health impacts, education impacts and severe economic impacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission is doing an inquiry at the moment into maritime efficiency. In Svitzer's submission to the inquiry they say that of the four factors contributing to the productivity and efficiency of our ports, one is the industrial relations terms that they're currently having to operate under—things like: minimum crewing rules, which are not in any way linked to operational safety requirements; high penalty rates which don't correlate to the work actually done; restrictions on type of recruitments et cetera. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know a lot of people have been talking about the low pay. On our side of this chamber, we absolutely want Australians to be well paid for their work. That is making sure that our businesses are as supported as they can be to be as competitive as they can be to make sure that they can pay their workers as much as they can. If our government hadn't taken the action we did during COVID there would be fewer businesses employing Australians in this country than there are right now because, guess what, unless you want to live in a communist country, governments don't employ everybody and governments don't set wages. That is not how it actually works. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most concerning things, when I think about the efficiency and productivity of ports—which won't be addressed and will actually be exacerbated by this particular bill—were the Milo and Magnum clauses in the agreements with our tugboat companies. When you want to know why it costs you so much to get products from overseas, it might be because of the lazy $18,000 that this company had to spend to get a helicopter to drop off a crate of Magnums—not guns, let me assure the chamber, but ice creams—because the crew refused to unload a ship because there weren't enough chocolate ice creams in the fridge on the tugboat. These are not low-paid workers. These guys and gals earn in excess of $250,000 a year. They are more highly paid than some senators in this chamber. And they're refusing to unload a ship because they don't have enough ice creams on board. Do you know what the company has to do? They have to get a helicopter for 18 grand: 'Here you go boys and girls, can you unload the ship now please?' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's our current industrial relations system, let alone what will happen under the draconian, union-friendly measures that this government is bringing before us, which will wreak havoc on our economy and will wreak havoc on our ports and in our aviation sector. Qantas has said they're going to close down their marginal routes.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  I rise to speak briefly on the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022 and the reforms introduced by the bill, particularly to address the gender pay gap. I'm pleased to see movement on making gender equality an objective of the Fair Work Act, introducing a statutory equal remuneration principle, strengthening rights to flexible working arrangements and banning pay gag clauses. These are all fixes that the Greens have called for over many years and which we welcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The overall gender pay gap in Australia remains at around 14 per cent. Women, on average, still have to work an extra 60 days to earn the same as men. Men are twice as likely to be higher paid than women across almost all industries, and 85 per cent of employers still have pay gaps in men's favour, even in female dominated workplaces. For First Nations women, women from culturally diverse backgrounds, women with disability and older women the gap can be even worse. The gender pay gap is a product of systemic and cultural factors, like workplace discrimination, lack of workplace flexibility, the cost and availability of child care and the impact of taking time out for caring work. Closing the gender pay gap will take a concerted effort by employers and governments at all levels. This bill makes a promising start, building on the work of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency in tracking gender inequality, and complementing the work to be done by the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make comments about pay secrecy. Pay secrecy has been an ongoing contributor to the gender pay gap. In 2015 I introduced a private member's bill, the Fair Work Amendment (Gender Pay Gap ) Bill, to ban the use of pay secrecy clauses. So I am very pleased to see this concept being legislated today. For too long, employment contracts that insist on pay secrecy have been used to hid the gender pay gap. Britain and the US no longer allow such clauses. The European Union is set to make pay transparency a binding measure for member states. But pay gag clauses remain a normal practice in Australia. This bill is an overdue measure to end that practice and to create a more level playing field for women in the workplace. No-one should ever feel obligated to tell someone what they're earning, but no-one should be prevented from discussing it. Promoting healthy conversations about pay is the best way to bring inequality out into the open and then address it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On gender equity and equal remuneration, the easiest way to close the gender pay gap is to pay women more. A key driver of the gender pay gap is the fact that jobs dominated by women, often as a result of entrenched gender stereotypes, remain undervalued. The teaching, child care, nursing, cleaning, retail and aged care sectors all have lower wages, poorer conditions, job insecurity and lower retention rates. Yet we saw through the pandemic how crucial and critical those roles are. The wages paid in those sectors need to better reflect their value. I'm very pleased that the aged care work value case recognised the gendered nature of evaluation of work and the under-valuation of work. There is no justification for pushing a wheelbarrow being valued more highly than pushing a wheelchair, yet average wages in care sectors remain lower than those in construction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was working at a community legal centre when the social services equal remuneration case, taken by my union, the Australian Services Union, was decided. I can tell you that the boost that was provided to female dominated sectors covered by that decision was invaluable. People were properly paid for the work they did. Organisations had some certainty that they could attract and retain staff. People felt valued, and their productivity and wellbeing improved as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women make up 61 per cent of workers being paid based on an award, so ensuring that the Fair Work Commission is tasked with considering gender equity and equal remuneration principles when making determinations will improve work conditions, productivity and wellbeing across all award sectors. I welcome these objectives and the establishment of expert panels on pay equity in the care and community sector to guide that work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to flexible working arrangements, whether they can access flexible working arrangements is a key factor for many parents in deciding whether to return to work and on what terms. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, most Australian women with as child under two who have returned to paid work use some kind of flexible working arrangement. Access to flexible working arrangements is also a key factor in how caring is shared between parents. For victims survivors of family, domestic or sexual violence flexible arrangements may be the only way to juggle work and dealing with trauma or the emotional and administrative fallout from escaping an abusive situation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Normalising flexible working arrangements recognises the productivity benefits of ensuring that all workers can juggle family, personal and work responsibilities. Later start times, shared roles, days working from home or other arrangements can improve staff retention and staff wellbeing. Many employers recognise this and will grant requests for flexibility, but some bosses will just say no without considering whether and how they could actually make it work. We therefore welcome the requirement for employers to grant reasonable requests for family-friendly working arrangements, accommodating the need to care for elderly or disabled relatives, or recovery from family, domestic and sexual violence.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, on parental leave, the Greens have called for strong, equitable paid parental leave for many, many years. Whilst we are pleased that the government has committed to 26 weeks paid leave from 2026 and to the use-it-or-lose-it provisions, we still maintain that those improvements should be implemented much sooner, and we still want superannuation included on PPL and for leave to be remunerated at the parent's wage with a cap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Relevantly to this bill, I congratulate my colleague Senator Barbara Pocock for her work in getting the government to agree that employers be required to consider all reasonable requests for extended unpaid parental leave. For many families, the 12 months that they're currently entitled to may not be enough—for example, if a child is unwell or requires special attention, if a parent is unwell or just needs some more time to transition back to work or if they live in a childcare desert, which is something that the government would also need to address, and they have no family support to help with child care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Being able to request an extension of unpaid parental leave and know that employers will properly consider that request will be a significant comfort for many families. These provisions won't impact all families, but, for those who need a bit of extra time without risking their job, these provisions will be very welcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I commend the work of Greens leader Adam Bandt and our new and very capable Senator Barbara Pocock in negotiating improvements to this bill that will not only help women but will better protect workers, particularly lower paid workers. The Greens commend this bill to the chamber.</span>

It's a time of very high inflation in this country. We're looking at eight per cent inflation by the end of the year. Electricity prices, as announced in the last budget, are going up by approximately 56 per cent over the course of the next two years, and gas prices are going up by approximately 40 to 44 per cent over the next 12 months.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that high-cost, high-inflationary environment, where the economic outlook for the world, amongst our trading partners and in our own country is very dangerous, the government is choosing to introduce this bill. I'm gravely concerned about the impact this bill will have in terms of the Australian economy and in terms of people actually having jobs. That is my grave concern as I consider this bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was left to reflect last night, as I listened to my good friend Senator Susan McDonald give her presentation in relation to this bill, that we heard from someone who's actually owned and operated a business. Senator McDonald owned a chain of butcher stores called Super Butcher in my home state of Queensland, and she had to turn that business around from a situation where it wasn't doing too well. It had some internal issues.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She turned that business around successfully and carried the weight of turning that business around. That weight included the weight of managing the cash flow, of paying all the expenses; the weight of knowing that the employees who are employed by that business are relying on the business owner to provide their future employment; the weight of dealing with customers; and the weight of dealing with supply chain issues, regulatory issues and all the other issues which employers in this country face.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflect on my own background in the mining industry. I worked for a mid-tier copper and gold mining company that successfully built two mines in one of the poorest countries in the world, Laos. We lifted thousands of people out of poverty, and we did it to the highest environmental and safety standards and with a very deep and committed social licence program, which included microfinance programs to lift the local village people out of poverty and provided opportunities for them to introduce microindustries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the height of the global financial crisis, it nearly all came crashing down. The price of copper went from approximately $4.30 a pound to $1.30 a pound in the course of two weeks. The share price of that company went from about $1.12 a share to 8½c. I remember having a discussion with a dear friend, who was a fellow senior executive in that company. He was going on a family holiday, and he said, 'Paul, if the receivers and managers are appointed, if the administrators come into the business, try and get that painting out of my office.' It was his own personal property and meant a great deal to him from a family perspective. That's how bad the situation was. We got through that with a lot of support from shareholders, from suppliers we had to negotiate with, but it was difficult; it was extraordinarily difficult. We were on the precipice—absolutely no question about that. That experience left a deep mark on me.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  I rise to speak about why we need a national anti-corruption commission, and the main reason is Scott Morrison. To introduce into law in Australia an independent anti-corruption commission is a cornerstone of the government's agenda to restore public trust and strengthen standards of integrity in the federal government. Ask anyone and they will agree with you that trust in Australia's democratic process has dropped to an all-time low after a decade of rorts, ministerial scandals, jobs for mates and secret ministerial portfolios under the former Morrison government. To clarify, let me run up a tab of scandals that come to mind: sports rorts, community grants rorts, carpark rorts, MMI grants rorts, the former Prime Minister's Office, reckless behaviour regarding Border Force, an asylum seeker vessel on election day this year during caretaker convention and, the piece de resistance, secret ministerial portfolios held by the former Prime Minister. I put it to you: do you think Scott Morrison has secretly sworn himself in to be Santa Claus this year? No, it wouldn't be Santa Claus; it's more likely to be Ebenezer Scrooge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">History will remember the former Prime Minister as someone who secretly kept power, who secretly swore himself into five separate portfolios—in secret from his ministry and those opposite, and in secret from the Australian people. It's a shameful act which he will never live down, and our country will never live down having a prime minister who so deceitful. Those opposite know it. They may not have supported the censure motion in that other place, but they know it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 121 years since Federation, what the former Prime Minister did was single-handedly undermine our country, undermine the principle of responsible government, undermine our institutions and, once again, undermine everyone's trust in our democracy. The Solicitor-General found this to be the case, and so did Virginia Bell's independent investigation. Ever since the Liberals came into power in 2013, trust in our political institutions has backed down to cynical levels. Political trust actually declined to its lowest-ever recorded level in 2019, according to the Australian electoral data. Since 2012, Australians have slipped 12 points on Transparency International's annual Corruption Perceptions Index. At the same time, our rank in the global index has fallen 11 places, from 7th to 18th. Of all the OECD countries, Australia tied with Hungary in dropping the highest number of points over this period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If people are to regain faith in politics in our community and across the country, we must act decisively, we must be open and we must be transparent. That is why the Albanese government is ensuring a national integrity commission is independent and powerful, having the power of a standing royal commission. It would not be a toothless commission, like the previous government recommended. Mind you, it was their recommendation but they never even acted on it! It's going to deal with serious systemic corruption. It's going to be able to receive allegations from a whole range of sources. It's going to be able to hold public hearings at its discretion. All of those are important features and very important differences to the former Morrison government's model. For a moment, can you imagine adopting a Morrison model of a national integrity commission? What a farcical joke that would be after his record of impropriety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the Australian government's model will be able to investigate the past. That's another deficiency of the former government's proposal. All the states' and territories' anticorruption commissions have the power to explore past instances of corruption at their discretion and where they think it's appropriate. Anticorruption commissions serve the public by uncovering corruption and ensuring that members of the government, including politicians, are held accountable for their conduct. Every Australian state and territory has now established its own anticorruption commission. But, despite the fact that it overwhelmingly has public support, there is still no anticorruption commission at the federal level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 2018 the Morrison government was finally dragged kicking and screaming to commit to establishing a Commonwealth integrity commission. However, three years later they had still failed to honour that commitment. The Morrison government's ever-increasing list of scandals and cover-ups has reinforced the urgent need for a powerful, transparent and independent National Anti-Corruption Commission. The Albanese government has worked with Australia's pre-eminent legal and integrity experts to develop and design the principles that will ensure that the commission is the most effective anticorruption watchdog in the country. Under these design principles the commission will have broad jurisdiction to investigate Commonwealth ministers, public servants, statutory office holders, government agencies, politicians and personal staff of politicians, carrying out its functions independently of government with discretion to commence inquiries into serious and systemic corruption on its own initiative or in response to referrals, including from whistleblowers, and complaints from the public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure the commission's independence, the commissioner and any deputy commissioner will serve for a single fixed term and have security of tenure comparable to that of a federal judge, to be overseen by a statutory bipartisan joint standing committee of the parliament, to require the commission to provide information about its work. To ensure bipartisanship and to ensure that support for the commission's work, that committee would be responsible for confirming the commission's nominations by the government, having the power to investigate allegations of serious corruption that occurred before or after its establishment. It would have the power to hold public hearings where the commission determines that it is in the public's interest to do so, being empowered to make findings of fact, including a finding of corrupt conduct, but not to make determinations of criminal liability. Findings that could constitute criminal conduct would be referred to the Australian Federal Police or the Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions for further consideration. The commission would operate with procedural fairness, and its findings would be subject to judicial review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's policy has for some time now been to establish the National Anti-Corruption Commission, which will make a permanent and much-needed change to standards of integrity and accountability in the federal government. The Australian people deserve nothing less. The Australian people deserve to have a federal parliament and representatives they can trust. Corruption in the federal government has been growing over recent years, and the Liberals have failed to take any action to tackle it, leaving the Commonwealth government as the only Australian government without a body dedicated to uncovering and stamping out corruption by public officials.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maybe the enduring legacy of the Morrison Liberal government will be a national integrity commission, a legacy because of the former government's corrupt actions in government, leading to the need to establish such a commission and to try to restore integrity back into our democracy. I sincerely hope so. But there is nothing more fundamental and more important to the Australian people than to have faith and trust in our democracy. People have fought in so many wars to ensure that we have stayed a free and democratic country. In this place, in this chamber and in the other place, we all have a responsibility to make sure that there is integrity, that we stamp out any corruption and that the Australian people, when they vote, know they're going to get a government that is trustworthy, transparent and accountable for its actions. Unfortunately, over the past decade, the Morrison government, the Turnbull government and the Abbott government have led us to a situation where this legislation we've put through the parliament is so necessary. I sincerely hope this commission reflects on the past actions of the former government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250216" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:10</span>):  Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, today I rise to talk about something that is desperately needed in our own home state of Western Australia—upgrades to the Henderson industrial precinct. Western Australia has a very long and a very proud history of supporting our nation's defence and defence industry, both in times of peace and of war. Today we have world-leading advanced manufacturing capabilities supported by training and upskilling in using the latest defence technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Henderson maritime precinct, 23 kilometres south of Perth, is home to some of the most innovative defence supply companies and workforces, particularly related to shipbuilding and maintenance. The Australian Marine Complex and its common user facility was an initiative of the state government, and, in 2003, was funded by the federal government. At the time, it was 'build it and we hope they will come', and industry has certainly come over the proceeding 20 years. But it is time for this facility to get a much-needed upgrade to turn it into a world-leading facility. Sadly, the WA state government is doing what it does best—contemplating an issue, conducting a review, then conducting another review, and then doing absolutely nothing. It is now time to get into gear. We know what needs to be done, and it now just needs to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those of you not aware of Henderson: since opening in mid-2003 the Australian Marine Complex has generated more than 21,000 direct jobs and delivered projects worth billions of dollars. It has almost single-handedly facilitated the fabrication of millions of tonnes of goods and manufactured goods, particularly for our oil and gas sector, in the north-west. Since 2017 I have been taking many state and federal colleagues, ministers and prime ministers to Henderson to see just what our state is capable of and is delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Henderson didn't make its way into the 2016 white paper officially as the second major shipbuilding facility in Australia, we managed to remedy that—although it didn't quite make the white paper. The precinct itself is made up of a unique mix of agreements between the Western Australian state government, the federal government and defence industry companies, including BAE, Austal and our industrial powerhouse, Civmec. It's home to around 150 other businesses in five designated zones—shipbuilding, technology, support industry, fabrication and a recreational boating precinct. But it is bursting at the seams and desperately now needs Latitude 32 to be developed by the state government, which has sat on it for five years, so that we have a much-increased capacity to develop our logistics, freight and supply and manufacturing supports not only to the shipbuilding sector but also to our mining, oil and gas sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australia's naval shipbuilding industry is going from strength to strength, largely off the back of the coalition government's investment in 70 new naval ships to be built in Australia. The shipbuilding precinct itself is located on the beautiful Western Australia coast, overlooking Garden Island and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">St</span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rling</span>. The Anzac class frigates are currently, and have been for a number of years, undergoing their mid-life cycle capability assurance program. It is quite an impressive sight to see three of our Anzacs up on the dry dock itself, being maintained.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's not all. We've also got Austal shipyards, who have built hundreds of vessels both here in Australia and overseas. They are currently in the process of delivering, at any one time, up to five Guardian class patrol boats and also the Cape class patrol boats for the Navy. Their vessels are on schedule and they are complete to deliver a further five in coming months. In total, 21 Guardian class patrol boats are scheduled to be built. Again, production is well underway and delivery is also well underway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Australian Marine Complex, the state government owns and runs the common user facility and most of the key infrastructure, such as wharves, the floating dock, the self-propelled modular transporters and vessel transfers. There are very longstanding and well-documented deficiencies and infrastructure challenges, which are now becoming a considerable constraint to industry in the area. All of these have been known for a long time. But, again, we have the minister and the Premier in Western Australia constantly saying they're ready for business and they want more from Navy and from civil companies, but they are not providing the facilities that are required to keep growing the industry in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What sorts of things need to be done? In May 2018, I started a very constructive three-way dialogue with the state minister Paul Papalia and the then defence industry minister Christopher Pyne on how the federal and state governments can work together to transform this remarkable precinct. That was in 2018. Not only did we talk about what was required but I also sent correspondence to both ministers. We had a very amicable and agreeable exchange, and we agreed on what was required to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The McGowan government did agree, back then in 2018, that a failure to upgrade state infrastructure would limit the chances to take advantage of emerging opportunities which are well and truly with us now. The state is now in danger of losing a number of these projects because they simply have not provided the infrastructure. In November 2020, the McGowan government released two planning studies and allocated just under $90 million for four projects to fund some of the major works there, but they were still not the majority of works that were needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the correspondence with Chris Pyne and Paul Papalia at the time, in 2018, I went through and we agreed on the priorities. The priorities that I saw were the mapping and establishment of a high- and wide-load corridor and the sinking of overhead powerlines that were clearly restricting access for oversized freight. The local and regional road network needed upgrades to support efficient and safe access to the precinct now and in the future. Anybody who drives through the Henderson precinct at change of shift hours will know just how congested and dangerous those roads are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Traffic signals at all dangerous intersections need to be either put in or upgraded. Workers find it incredibly difficult if they don't have a car to get in and out of the area. The Thornlie to Cockburn rail line will improve accessibility, but the problem is that it is still kilometres away from the Henderson precinct. For four years the state government is going to be putting in new bus routes from there and the Fremantle railway so that we can get apprentices and workers in and out of that area efficiently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a pressing strategic need for a second shipping channel to both the Australian Marine Complex and, in particular, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">St</span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rling</span>, which is a state government responsibility. In fact, the work had started under the previous Liberal government, but it has not proceeded. That is not only a strategic barrier for any visiting submarines and ships to HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span>; it is also a significant constraint just having one channel. Again, it's been delayed and delayed and delayed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what needs to be done at Henderson. The state government had a nearly $10 million study paid for by the federal government when I was Minister for Defence. It said exactly the same things that we did in 2018 about what needed to be done. A very good master plan has been developed with the federal government and the WA state government with defence, yet again they simply will not act. I don't know why. Again, it is review, review. They've got the money. They've got the plan. We know what we need to do not only to attract defence for the next few decades but also to expand the other industries there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>Finally, I'm also incredibly concerned that the Albanese Labor government in their first budget was silent on what has happened to the $4.3 billion that the previous government allocated for a large-vessel dry berth at Henderson, and it's time for the federal government to come clean. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="I0U" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge the amazing work and life that the Australian music industry brings to each and every one of us in this country. The Australian music industry—the artists, the producers, the managers, the writers—has had it pretty tough for the last few years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is the last day of Australian Music Month. We've got a bunch of musicians and artist promoters in the building, showing us exactly what their industry is made of and what the industry needs. We've got representatives from ARIA and APRA. We've got the brothers from Lime Cordiale here, Louis and Oli. And we've got the amazing Amy Taylor from Amyl and the Sniffers in town. The music legend Michael Chugg—or Chuggi, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle; I know the two of you are good friends—is here as well. These representatives from the music industry are here because they are calling on us as the parliament to start standing up for them, to protect their industry and to help their industry to get back on its feet after the horrendous last couple of years, from the bushfires in the summer of 2019-20 right through to COVID. Now, as the next summer festival season comes around, the industry is struggling to get back up on its feet because of the extreme weather and extreme flooding we're dealing with. We've seen all those pictures and stories of artists and festival-goers having to manage in the midst of events that are being washed and flooded out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contemporary music industry in this country has largely existed and grown successfully in spite of a lack of support, from a national policy perspective. We know that the Minister for the Arts, Mr Tony Burke, is currently undertaking a culture policy review, and we look forward to seeing the results of that handed down hopefully in coming weeks. One of the things the industry has been calling for is the creation of Music Australia, similar to the agency that already exists for screen, Screen Australia. It's kind of crazy that we're in 2022, our music industry is one of our most successful exports in this country and it contributes billions of dollars to our economy, yet it is the one part of the arts industry and creative industry in Australia that does not have its own dedicated government agency. I think it is time for us to establish Music Australia, to allow a government agency that can bring together government policies and industry expertise and advice all in one place, just as we have with Screen Australia, which is so important to underpinning the growth and expertise within our screen industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost-benefit ratio of investing in our music industry is so obvious. We know that the live music industry alone is worth $16 billion. That's the live music industry. Think about all of the jobs that come from that, the life that is put into our suburbs, cities and towns and the ability for people to engage and connect. It is truly about enriching community. The amount of export that the Australian music industry contributes is phenomenal. So if we are reviewing Australia's artistic policies, our creative policies, why would we not look ahead and say, 'Look, a Music Australia agency in this country is exactly what we need, and we should fund it'?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the Minister for the Arts. He's got all of the evidence in front of him. I know he is a dedicated lover of Australian music. Let's turn those words into action. Here in this place today, that's exactly what these musicians and promoters and those working in the industry are calling for: $100 million in recurrent funding for the establishment and continuation of Music Australia. It would be money well spent. It would ensure that Australia's musicians and artists can continue to grow and invest not just locally but of course on the international stage as well. So it's wonderful to have them in the building today. I hope that my colleagues here in this place and the other place engage and listen and talk to them about what is needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A warning sign for this government. We've had a decade of attacks on the creative industry. The last government did virtually nothing but tear down artists in this country. Then, when they needed us more than ever, in the midst of COVID—we know it was our artists who were hit hardest and first because of COVID, and they are still struggling to get back on their feet—the previous government said, 'Tough luck.' Well, we have seen a change of government. We've seen a change of many seats, and the make-up of this place has changed. It is time that we listened to the Australian community and our artists and said, 'Actually, that's not good enough anymore.' The creative industries are essential to making this country lucky, to making this country the best country on earth, to ensuring that we can tell our stories and hear our own stories and reflect on who we are through various creative means. This is essential if we are to progress Australia in a positive light. Our kids deserve it and our artists deserve it. Those who are here today deserve to be heard.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:28</span>):  In the very few minutes that remain—it's a great shame I only have a few minutes, because the topic I wanted to talk about is a matter of great importance to our region and a matter of great significance to me—I want to extend my deepest appreciation to the Chin Human Rights Organization and the people of Mizoram state in India. A few weeks ago, I had the privilege of travelling independently, by myself, to India in order to get to the border with Burma, in the north-east of India, to see for myself the unfolding Burmese refugee crisis that is happening in the north-west of Burma, across the border with India. I particularly want to congratulate and thank the people of Mizoram state, because, unlike the government of India, Mizoram state, who share ethnic and religious similarities to the Chin people of northern Burma, have been tremendously generous in their support in providing safe haven and refuge to many of the Chin people that have crossed the border into India.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to use this very brief opportunity today to extend my deepest appreciation for the great warmth and hospitality that was shown to me when I travelled all the way to Aizawl on the border between India and Burma. I want to thank the government of Mizoram state, and the chief minister and governor who made their time available to meet with me. To the many religious leaders that came out supported my trip, I want to say a very, very generous thank you. I gave the Chin people who are sitting in refugee camps on the border with India a commitment that I would come back to Australia and fight for their cause, so that those who already have humanitarian visas issued by the Australian government can get an exit permit from the Indian government so they can come and find a new future for themselves here in Australia. I recommit myself to that commitment I gave to them when I was in India a few weeks ago.</span>

Disruptive classrooms, of course, lead to disrupted learning for our students, contributing to declining literacy and numeracy results and denying students the opportunity to reach their full educational, economic and social potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Data from the Program for International Student Assessment showed that 15-year-old students, so year 10s, in classes with a poor disciplinary climate are around seven months behind in their learning, compared to their peers in more-disciplined classrooms. Research has consistently shown that structured classroom environments are better for our teachers and our students, both in academic terms and for the wider wellbeing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not at all an indictment of teachers or even the schools or educators. This is not a criticism levelled at those who nurture or teach our children. What we want to see is teachers and educators being supported and empowered to help students learn to thrive during their time at school, so it's important for our teachers and educators to be properly equipped with the tools that they need to help manage disruptive classrooms, and it's essential for the government to be able to work together with the relevant state and territory governments to provide the support and training that our teachers and educators need to deliver the best learning opportunities possible for our children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to the Senate Education and Employment References Committee's inquiry into how we can best support our teachers and students and address this growing challenge. I encourage all stakeholders to participate in the inquiry. If you've got a view on this, if you've got some experience in this, we want to hear from you. Please make a submission by 31 March.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  I rise to celebrate the passage of the National Anti-Corruption Commission legislation, which passed the Senate last night and which, in just the last hour, has been back through the House of Representatives and will now actually be delivered. This is legislation that delivers the single biggest integrity reform this parliament has seen in decades. It's a powerful, independent, transparent commission. It will investigate serious or systemic corruption in the federal public sector, and for those who are asking the question: no, politicians are not exempt; no, the Labor Party is not exempt. This is real. This is transparent. This is going to make a fundamental difference. It has the power to investigate ministers, parliamentarians, their staff, statutory officeholders, employees of all government entities, and contractors. It has the power to hold public meetings. It will have a mandate to stop corruption and educate Australians about corruption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a promise made in the lead up to the election by Labor, and we are now delivering on that promise. Everywhere I go in South Australia people raise this issue with me. I've had people come up to me in the supermarket, in the petrol station, at street-corner meetings and in representations to my office. This is a really important issue for the people of South Australia and for people across the whole of Australia, but in my home state it is the most common issue that is presented to me that people are concerned about. So I'm delighted that it has passed and that we will now get on with the job of delivering exactly what we have promised.</span>

As travel opened up, I was ecstatic to be able to visit my ammi in Pakistan and my daughter in the US, who I hadn't seen for over two years. It was a year of deep loss, as well, as my beloved cousin, Imran; my brilliant teacher, my friend and mentor, Dr Ronnie Harding; and my bestest longboy, Cosmo, all passed away, leaving a big hole in my life.</span>

In Australia, we got rid of the toxic Morrison government, and let's not forget the 'greenslide'. In Iran, we are seeing a massive, women led revolution for justice. However, in the US there was the devastating overturning of Roe v Wade, a big step backwards for women's rights. </span>

The Victorian National Party had our most successful results since the Second World War, and I am proud to stand here in the Australian Senate and say the party that is over a century old has gotten rid of rural Independents, a failed experiment in regional Victoria. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our strong values, positive vision for the future and our pragmatic approach to policy has seen our party room, at the Victorian level, significantly grow. I want to congratulate Peter Walsh and our whole team back at home—all our volunteers—for making that happen. Congratulations to Annabel Cleeland in Euroa and Kim O'Keefe, a former mayor from Shepparton. To Azin and the whole multicultural community at Shepparton, thank you for voting National.  Jade Benham, of strong Italian heritage, is going to do a fabulous job in Mildura. There is Gaelle Broad in Bendigo, a strong National with strong values, and Martin Cameron, the only guy in the new crew, a local footballer and tradie down in Morwell, where the Latrobe Valley rejected the Labor Party's renationalisation of the SEC and voted for the National Party in that seat. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am particularly proud that, as a conservative party and a party that doesn't resile from our conservative values, at a Victorian level we have sent our federal representatives and our state parliamentary representatives—we have 50 per cent female representation at a federal and state level. There is not a quota girl amongst us; we were all preselected by our party, and we are all going to do an amazing job on behalf of the rural and regional communities that have sent us to Spring Street and to Canberra.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  The response we saw in the House from former prime minister Scott Morrison to the findings of the Bell inquiry and the censure motion against him requires calling out, because there was an opportunity today for the former Prime Minister to apologise to the parliament, to the people of Australia and to our democratic traditions, and to put on record that mistakes were made. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think most people in this place and people in the community would have appreciated hearing an apology today, but that is not what we got from former prime minister Scott Morrison today; we got defiance and denial that anything was wrong. I say this today because I want the parliament to understand that this is not partisan or political; it is more important than that. Some things matter more than politics. As Bridget Archer said in the other House today, sometimes these things are 'not a game'. This is not a game. When senators come in here and when ministers go to the Governor-General they swear an oath to serve the Australian people and to be honest to them, to be upfront with them and to keep them informed about their decisions. That is not what happened under the previous government. There is an opportunity now, I think, for members all across this chamber and all across this house and for every person who loves our democracy and loves our parliament to call this behaviour out, because it should never have happened and it should never happen again. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  I rise to speak to an alarming report published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> on Saturday about a massive increase in the number of Australian adolescents being treated for gender dysphoria. The causes of this huge increase in children being treated for gender dysphoria need to be investigated urgently, and I will later today move to refer this matter to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. According to the report, a freedom of information request has revealed there were 2,067 people aged under 18 enrolled in public adolescent gender clinics, which is almost 10 times the number in 2014. The report notes these are only figures for public clinics. It is likely that the total figure, including children being treated by GPs and private clinics, is much higher. The number of adolescents being prescribed puberty blockers in 2021 was 624, up from only five in 2014; while 204 adolescent were on cross-sex hormones, up from 27 in 2014. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These treatments have been conclusively shown to cause lifelong negative health impacts, such as reduced bone density, leading to an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures, impaired fertility, impaired sexual function and libido, potentially negative impacts on brain development and possibly increased risks of developing hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes. Mental health experts in Australia and overseas are very concerned by these developments, by the influence of ideology amplified by social media and manifested in the so-called affirmation approach to treating children with gender dysphoria, and by the debilitating long-term psychosocial impacts of these treatments. Ultimately, we all want the best outcomes for young Australians.</span>

Mr McGowan should be telling Mr Albanese and Minister Tony Burke that they should immediately exempt the mining and resources sector from this disastrous legislation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr McGowan knows that Western Australia relies on this sector like no other state in the nation. He made much of how this sector kept Australia afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic. Western Australians accepted being cut off from the rest of Australia for so long because they knew how important it was to keep the mining and resources sector going throughout COVID-19. Mr McGowan, as we know, loves the revenue as well as the jobs this sector provides for WA. In fact this year's WA state budget highlighted the huge contribution the sector makes to WA coffers, with a cumulative contribution of $12.58 billion, and the sector provides over 65,000 direct full-time jobs in Western Australia. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr McGowan needs to take note of the recent comments made by BHP Chief Executive Mike Henry, who said there is no case for multi-employer bargaining in the mining industry. Mr Henry quite rightly points out that the current approach in the industry has been working well, and workers in the industry are paid well. He also says, and he is right when he says, Australia's global competitiveness will be harmed by aspects of the bill that risk flexibility and give rise to increases in industrial action. Then we have the Rio Tinto boss, Simon Trott, who says the legislation will be a handbrake on mining and the wider economy and a handbrake on economic growth, productivity and wages. Mr McGowan should stand up for Western Australia and our mining and resources sector and condemn this radical legislation.</span>

I take this opportunity to break a few of these myths about trans people and the use of puberty blockers. Trans people and trans young people are not new. There are many historical and cross-cultural examples of trans people, including in First Nations communities. There's nothing inherent about being trans that makes them more vulnerable to poor mental health. However, a lack of support, a lack of health care, and discrimination do contribute to poor mental health outcomes.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Puberty blockers are not permanent. They're a healthcare option at an enormously stressful time for young trans people, and they give adolescents a chance to develop emotionally and cognitively before making further decisions. Data shows these treatments save lives and reduce self-harm. Contrary to what was put forward by Senator Hanson, the common belief that children can access invasive medical treatment is not true. It is in fact difficult to access gender-affirming medical care. It involves multiple assessments, multidisciplinary teams and long waiting times. </span>

Every Australian child and family deserves to have access to the care and support that they need to thrive.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Federal and state governments are due to negotiate a new funding agreement for our schools, and it's a critical time in those negotiations. It comes at a time when private schools are receiving more and more funding which they increasingly do not need, while the public sector is being run into the ground. Because of sweetheart deals struck by previous governments, both Labor and Liberal, private schools increasingly have the cash to outcompete the public sector, and that is the core of the problem. Governments have allowed our education system to crumble to the point that public schools are in danger of being a poorly funded social safety net, while private education becomes the default option.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no exaggeration to say that public education as we know it may cease to exist unless radical funding reallocations are made. Minister Clare knows this, and he has said that the educational divide between rich and poor, city and country, 'ricochets through generations'. But his words are not being met by action. The government continues the longstanding bipartisan policy of privatisation. As Gonski panel member Ken Boston says, the Gonski reforms have been 'politicised, bastardised and cherrypicked'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No other country in the developed world pumps as much money into private schooling as Australia does. We are an outlier. With every stitched-up budget, with every hamstrung bilateral agreement, with every extra cent for private schools, our kids' futures get darker and the inequality gap gets wider. This is the last chance for public schooling in Australia. If we don't start pumping money into the public sector and taking it away from the overfunded private sector, we are giving up on equity in Australian education. </span>

It gives us a target to work towards for the next election, which will be here before we know it. To our candidates: you worked long hours day in, day out. You sacrificed personal events and time with your families, and you were always available after hours to get on with the job of running a campaign. Well done to you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To our volunteers: thank you. Through two long pre-poll weeks with all four of Melbourne's seasons, blisteringly hot one day, windy and cold the next—you've got to love Melbourne weather—you did it and you did it with a smile on your face. You stood up for the values that you believe in. Across our great state, from Warrnambool to Wodonga, from Narre Warren to Wallen, out you went, day after day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Premier Daniel Andrews on his election victory and wish him the best for his next term as Premier of Victoria. We should take heart from the fact that the best of our state is in front of us and not behind us. We must now come together as Victorians. Together we can do more than if we are apart. We must move on from the past and instead look towards our future and what we can achieve.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will of course continue to hold the Premier's government to account on all matters and continue to provide alternative solutions and ideas to the status quo. We will not stop championing what we believe in: fiscal responsibility; traditional Australian family values; individual liberties; a smaller government; less bureaucratic red and green tape; lower taxes; freedom of speech, of thought and of association; and the support of free enterprise. To the candidates, members, volunteers and supporters of the UAP: thank you; the best is yet to come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  Racially charged attacks and offensive language have no place in a national conversation on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament, not at any time. Before we even have the legislation to trigger a referendum, I'm seeing and hearing references to rednecks, race based conspiracies and personal attacks that contribute nothing to sensible, safe discussion, discourse and debate. Whether it is in our parliaments; in community meetings; in consultations and conversations with workplace colleagues; with family and friends; or simply at a barbecue, no Australian should be silenced on this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Delivering an outcome in an environment of fear, intimidation and bullying is not cultural and nor is it an Australian value that any of us should aspire to. Sure, make it robust and loud; but be careful about what we say and about platitudes that could silence or shame, such as being on the 'right' side of history. To take an alternative position is not giving up culture, being racist or rednecked, or means that you are diminished, a loser or discredited. I have concerns and questions about details, and I would have them even if I weren't a member of parliament. As an Australian, I don't want that space filled with diatribe, insults and public attacks, even if they're not directed at me.</span>

I will continue to speak out against those in debate, in organisations and in communities who seek to control through fear, undermining, intimidation and silencing, because it is disgraceful, distasteful and shameful. Above all else, it diminishes contribution and involvement.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  Earlier this week I presented a notice of motion to the Senate noting Holodomor. Today, I wish to acknowledge that last Saturday 26 November was the 89th anniversary of the enforced famine known as Holodomor. This famine took place in Ukraine between 1932 and 1933, and resulted from the deliberate actions of Joseph Stalin's communist government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Up to seven million Ukrainians were starved to death. In fact, the word 'holodomor' translates from Ukrainian as 'death by starvation' or 'murder by starvation'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cruel policies of the USSR at the time were aimed at suppressing Ukraine's resistance to the regime, as well as destroying their aspirations for democracy, nationhood and the assertion of their unique cultural and religious identity. The Soviet Union's denial of the famine continues today as an official policy of the Russian Federation. As I said, it's estimated that up to seven million Ukrainians starved to death as a result of these policies. These actions must be acknowledged, remembered and condemned, just as we condemn Russia's attacks on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity since the country declared independence in 1991, culminating in the illegal annexation of Crimea and this year's completely unjustified invasion of Ukraine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russia's decision to pull out of a deal to allow the export of grain from Ukraine from Black Sea ports marks a continued use of food as a political weapon. In the same way that we commemorate the Holocaust, it's vital that the story of Holodomor is told and acknowledged by the global community, just as it is in Ukraine. We need to honour the memory of those who suffered and teach the true history of this event to future generations.</span>

This year on International Day of People With Disability, our Australian disability community is more politically engaged than ever before. This year's global theme is all about the transformative solutions that we need for inclusive development. I would love it if this government would urgently adopt transformative solutions that would improve the lives of disabled people. However, this year this government has adopted a very different theme. The government wants us this Saturday—I kid you not—to spend a day #lookingbeyond our disabilities, as in look beyond our disabilities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government wouldn't tell First Nations people ahead of international day of First Nations people to look beyond their skin colour. This government wouldn't tell a woman ahead of International Women's Day to look beyond their gender. So why is it appropriate that this government would ask disabled people to look beyond the reality that we are disabled people? Imagine how a vision impaired person feels about that. Imagine how somebody with an invisible disability feels about that. How about we try something radical, folks, and look at the wheelchair. To address ableism we must authentically engage disabled people. To address ableism everyone must look directly at how we can improve our places and spaces. To our allies and supporters: see us; don't look past us. To fellow disabled people: I hope you feel seen and celebrated today and every day. To this government: do better. </span>

Visiting COP27 in Egypt the other week was a life-changing experience, as some of my colleagues who have been there will already acknowledge. It was clear to me that the whole world was there. There is no doubt that the world is committed to decarbonisation. With other world leaders there, including President Biden and Prime Minister Sunak, it was a shame that our Prime Minister didn't go and that Minister Bowen only showed up for a couple of days. There were more coalition members there than ALP and Greens members combined. I acknowledge that our acting deputy president was there. Why? Why weren't we there?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to care about a cleaner, healthier planet. We also need to care about sovereign energy security. It is why the coalition is there at the table. We recognise that the transition is vital but it's also going to be long, hard and very expensive—far more expensive than the government is currently telling you. Rewiring the Nation is going to cost an awful lot of money and the estimates that the government are telling you are blatantly wrong. We should be putting these renewables where the energy is needed, not hundreds of kilometres away. That is going to cost families huge hits on their energy bills and electricity prices are only going to go up. The other issue being ignored by Labor is the firming of those renewables and batteries won't do it. It was reassuring to hear John Kerry talk about the role of nuclear power in firming up renewables to decarbonise the planet.</span>

This holiday season I'm asking drivers on our roads to drive so others survive. Over 1,200 families will be sitting around a dinner table this year with an empty chair for a loved one killed on our roads. In some cases more than one seat will be empty. We need to think of those families when we are buckling up for a drive locally or when a road trip is calling. Make sure your car is roadworthy and make sure you are in a state to drive safely because no other family deserves to have an empty seat at the dinner table.</span>

Although it is easy to blame the concentration of rural and regional road deaths on visitors, we know locals are just as vulnerable to being killed or seriously injured. We don't need to be a hero out there and pretend we know the ins and outs and twists and turns of every road. Take the time to know your route and where the next rest area is. Check if the driver revivers are open. My message could not be more clear: never, ever compromise road safety.</span>

The hearings allow apparent problems in government operations to be explored and exposed, and give rise to a large amount of information which would not otherwise be disclosed. They have come to be recognised as a major parliamentary institution of accountability.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, won't the government's plans to axe a full week from the traditional four weeks of Senate estimates lead to less accountability, lower standards of probity and reduced disclosure of information, and mean that any problems in government operations are not properly explored and exposed by the Senate?</span>

If, as you say, you're all for transparency, accountability and respect of the parliament, will you listen to the crossbench senators and the opposition, and revisit your decision to axe this estimates week?</span>

There is some good news: there are some areas where we are on track. More than 89 per cent of babies are being born with a healthy birth weight, which is on track, and 96.7 per cent of children were enrolled in preschool in 2021, which is also on track. But there has been unacceptably slow progress in other areas, and some metrics have gone backwards. This includes children being school ready, rates of incarceration, the number of children in out-of-home care and deaths by suicide. For the majority of socioeconomic targets, there is little new data available to track trends reliably. Work has started to improve this data so that we will have a clearer picture of how we are tracking in future years.</span>

We on this side of the chamber—and I hope all across the chamber—are committed to doing this, and to ensuring sustained progress over the life of the 2020 National Agreement on Closing the Gap and the Commonwealth Closing the Gap Implementation Plan. It is clear that the Closing the Gap architecture can only work if we work together, when there are coordinated efforts from all jurisdictions and, most importantly, when we work in genuine partnership with First Nations peoples.

A number of commercial ICT contracts at Services Australia have recently ended their terms. The impacted contractors will end in line with the relevant terms and notice period. In other words, these contracts were coming to an end in accordance with the terms of the contracts, and the government and, in particular, Services Australia have applied the terms and conditions that relate to those contracts. These ICT providers have supported Services Australia to significantly bolster the ICT systems to meet unprecedented demand on our systems and services during emergencies such as the pandemic, and we do thank them for their support.</span>

In this government's first budget, $1.9 billion in equity investment was allocated for the development of the Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct in Darwin Harbour. Part of this funding is for common use marine infrastructure. Can the government rule out that this port will have a fossil fuel component such as a gas fed petrochemical hub?</span>

As you're aware and as you've said, the government will provide $1.9 billion in planned equity to support the development of the Middle Arm precinct in Darwin, together with regional logistic hubs along key transport links. It is intended to be a multipurpose precinct, so I am not in a position at this point in time to rule in particular developments or rule out particular developments. But this investment will enable the precinct to be globally competitive and sustainable, with a focus on low-emission production, green hydrogen and critical minerals processing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you're probably aware, Senator Cox, demand for clean energy sources is growing, particularly in the Northern Territory, and Labor's investment will help position the Northern Territory and northern Australia to diversify their economy and create new jobs. This investment is not a subsidy for fossil fuels in the way that some people have characterised it. Rather, funding will go towards infrastructure that will support users to export clean energy that is critical to meeting our commitment to net zero, like green hydrogen and lithium batteries that are critical to decarbonisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Particularly in my previous role as shadow minister for Northern Australia, I spent a lot of time in the Northern Territory with my good friend Senator McCarthy, along with House of Representatives member from the Northern Territory Luke Gosling, and Warren Snowdon, the former member, and now Marion Scrymgour. I know they are passionate advocates for the Northern Territory to diversify the economy up there and to take advantage of some of the incredible natural and mineral resources that the Northern Territory has. There are extremely exciting projects in the offing in the Northern Territory in that clean energy space, and I think they offer an opportunity to produce lots of very important jobs for that part of the country.</span>

It's all very well for the Greens to roll in, as they like to do, and ask, 'Did you do this? Did you do that?'—promoting some kind of conspiracy theory—without any evidence for it whatsoever. Perhaps Senator Cox would like to present any evidence she has to suggest that the federal government was involved in that. As I said, this is a really important development for the Northern Territory that the federal government is very pleased to back. It provides an opportunity for some very important job development in the Northern Territory going forward.</span>

It was all there: gender inequality with a lack of women in senior roles; a lack of accountability in systems; a work hard, play hard culture that left some, particularly young staff and young women, vulnerable to exploitation and sexual misconduct; and high levels of power indiscretion in relation to employment, combined with insecure employment. I would like to thank all of those current and former Parliament House staff who came forward to talk about their experiences working in parliament. Many of those experiences are harrowing, and speaking out must have required enormous strength and bravery.</span>

The recommendation flowed from the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">et the standard</span> report, and staff across the parliament have been consulted on how this new HR body should operate in practice. I would like to acknowledge the work of Meg Brighton and her team in the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service, which has made such a difference in such a short amount of time. We know staff trust it, they like using it, and it's been a really welcome addition to the infrastructure here.</span>

There are now 10 women in cabinet, the highest number ever to hold positions in an Australian cabinet. At the heart of the continuing work to become a model workplace is the experience of staff. Thank you to all who continue to advocate for change and to your respective unions. Labor strongly supports the creation of a staff advisory body to support the multiparty Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce and is committed to ensuring that staff voices are heard.</span>

Does the Albanese government support these treatments being administered to young Australians?</span>

I haven't specifically looked at the referral closely. It doesn't fall under my area of responsibility at this stage, but we will have a voting position that is clear on that. Again, I would say that these are not necessarily matters that the Senate is best placed to determine on access to healthcare services. I think the responsibility of the federal government is to make sure that the service system is there and that young people and their families are able to use them if they need to in a whole range of healthcare circumstances.</span>

Minister, can you confirm that it's correct that the report is modelled on the assumption that there will be a loss of 30 per cent of income for coal-fired power station workers and mine workers in the Hunter? And is the Hunter region the sole focus of this report, or is it wider and the government has got job losses across Australia?</span>

What I would say to those opposite is this. The majority of the global economy has committed to net zero by 2050. If we are not in a position to compete in that global economy, that is what will affect Australia's GDP growth, Australian jobs and the prosperity of future generations. I know you all want to think we can live in the past and we can go back to the 1950s, but, if you're committed to net zero, you're committed to transitioning the Australian economy.</span>

Minister, according to the Department of Home Affairs, there are 92 people who arrived by boat to seek asylum in Australia still stranded on Nauru. It seems from answers in Senate estimates this week that the government has no idea how many have been left to languish in Papua New Guinea and, in fact, couldn't care less. But I can inform the government that that number is 94.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, it's been almost 10 years since a Labor government first exiled those people offshore. Why will your Labor government not offer those 186 people temporary resettlement in Australia so they can be cared for and supported here while arrangements are being made for their permanent resettlement in a third country?</span>

That is something that we said a very long time before the election, and the fundamental problem here is that it took so long for the former government to do anything about the resettlement of these people. We all remember the years that an offer was on the table from the New Zealand government to resettle people from Nauru and it didn't happen. If the former government had taken up that option of resettling people in New Zealand, we should have been in a position where no-one was still in Nauru. But, of course, that was not taken by the former government, and that offer from New Zealand remained unanswered. We are certainly continuing to work with a number of third countries to consider facilitating resettlement, and that remains our policy.</span>

So we are doing a lot of work across a range of visa categories. I was talking yesterday about the work that we're undertaking to clear the visa backlog as well, but our position remains that people on Nauru should be resettled in third countries, and we continue to work very hard with those countries and the people themselves to enable that to happen.</span>

I welcome Senator McKim recognising that our government has committed to make permanent the very large number of people who the former government left languishing on temporary protection visas. That is a position that we always opposed. We thought it was extremely unfair for people who had been granted those temporary protection visas to remain lacking certainty from year to year, and of course there's a massive cost to taxpayers in requiring the regular processing and reprocessing of people on those temporary protection visas. So we are undertaking a lot of work to make that happen. It's not an easy process because of the sheer number of people who are on those temporary protection visas, but it's something that we remain committed to.</span>

Senator McKim knows that not only I but every member of the government takes these issues very seriously. That's why since taking office we have been putting so much effort into both third party resettlement and also the processing of people, thousands of people, who were left languishing on temporary protection visas when we took office. We will continue to do that, and we don't need these sorts of performances that are often undertaken in this chamber by the Greens.</span>

One of the things that we have been very focused on communicating is that our partnerships in the region will be guided by Pacific priorities. Communities and leaders across the blue Pacific have been clear about the impact of the three Cs. This was part of the discussion of the leaders discussion at the Pacific Islands Forum. The three Cs are climate, COVID and contest. This is articulated in the <span style="font-style:italic;">2050 strategy for the Blue </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Pacific </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Continent</span>, endorsed by forum leaders this year, and I was very pleased to be with Prime Minister Bainimarama and other Pacific leaders at the UN when this was launched. It is a vision for the Pacific's economic, environmental and strategic future written by and written for Pacific nations and Pacific peoples. At the heart is the simple concept that the Pacific knows best what its priorities are and how to achieve them.</span>

I remember as climate minister being struck by the power and sincerity of the voice of Pacific island nations on climate change, well ahead of where the domestic debate was in Australia. They have called on us to act, we have heard them and we have responded. We are honoured that all Pacific Islands Forum governments have supported Australia's bid to co-host with the Pacific COP31. How we deal with the climate crisis now is central to the future we leave young people and future generations.</span>

During the federal election campaign the now Prime Minister and now Treasurer promised there would be no changes to Australia's franking credits regime. In January 2021 he said, 'I can confirm Labor will not be taking any changes to franking credits to the next election.' Does the recent budget measure titled 'Improving the integrity of off-market share buy-backs' involve changes to franking credits?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to start with the responses from Senator Wong to Senator Birmingham's question about estimates and accountability and transparency. It is clear with this Labor government that it's not what they do, but it's what they say. They're not being transparent, they're not being accountable, but they're saying they are. Indeed, before the election the Prime Minister said that the Australian people deserve transparency and accountability, but what we found out in the last 16 hours is that this Labor government are reducing estimates—the time for non-government senators to ask questions of the government as to how public moneys are expended. We have found out, under Labor's proposals for the sitting schedule in the coming year, that they've reduced the estimates schedule by 25 per cent. This has overturned decades of convention that there are at least four weeks of estimates each year—estimates where non-government senators, regardless of who is in power, Labor or the coalition, can ask questions of the government. What we find with this Labor government, who promised transparency and accountability, is that they're doing everything but that. Indeed, transparency and accountability have just popped outside of this building. They've called a cab or an Uber and they're heading to the airport and getting the heck out of Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what we're seeing under this Labor government. We're seeing a Labor government who, for example, with the sitting schedule, promised family-friendly hours. Now, I'm happy to sit here each night until midnight. My family is not here in Canberra. For many senators here—most senators—their families are not here in Canberra. Labor promised family-friendly hours. But, under the sitting schedule, they've made it harder for senators from states like WA, where my colleague Senator O'Sullivan comes from, to actually get home and see their families on weekends. Labor have extended the sitting hours. They continue to extend the sitting hours. On this side of the chamber we don't have a problem with trying to assist the government in achieving its legislative program, but we do have a problem with the hypocrisy of a Labor Party who come into this chamber and talk about transparency and accountability yet do anything but be transparent and accountable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder, is this reluctance to hold four weeks of estimates in calendar year 2023 something to do with secrets, something to do with, I don't know, dodgy deals? Is there something that the Labor government don't want us to ask questions about? Looking at the estimates over the last couple of weeks, we've found out, for example, through looking at the budget papers and through asking questions of officials at the table, that at that jobsfest, that talkfest that was masquerading as a jobsfest, this Labor government spent $7,000 on a band. Now, fair play to the band. We all love live music—brilliant. But the government spent $7,000 on a band for an official function. Is that a good use of taxpayer money? Taxpayers paid for this. We found that out through the estimates process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Is it because the government does not wish us to prosecute and ask questions about energy policy in Australia?—remembering that this Labor government, this Labor Prime Minister, promised 97 times before the election that they will reduce power bills by $275. Yet in their budget papers we were able to find out that actually power bills are going to go up by 56 per cent. So, what this government is doing is deliberately limiting the ability of non-government senators to ask questions of ministers as to policies and to ask questions of officials as to how public money is being expended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about accountability. It is about standing up for the rights of taxpayers who fund the government of Australia and asking on behalf of taxpayers where that money is being spent and whether that money is being spent appropriately. We find out from this Labor Party that they are scared of transparency and accountability. No matter the words that come out of them, they all want to go and hide under the doona because they do not like being held to account.</span>

                  <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:08</span>):  There has been a change of government, and this is the government that is letting the light in. And the hypocrisy of those who've come in here with this faux outrage about having one week less to review an event that's not occurring is simply a complete misrepresentation of what's going on. To be clear, MYEFO, the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook that is provided to the Australian people—we would be familiar with that—normally happens around Christmas time. And when we return after the Christmas break, the MYEFO  document, with all that financial information, is then generally subject to review  by the process of estimates. That is how it works. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we've had an election this year, people. The former government seems to have missed that: there was an election. And because their figures were so lacking in transparency, because they were so dodgy and so unclear—like their own leader, who has been censured on this very day in the other chamber, censured in this very parliament today—they tried to construct a false narrative here about what is going on. The reality is that we are all for transparency, unlike the government-that-was under Mr Morrison.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Senator Birmingham should be a bit careful with these sorts of questions. He should know something about this lack of accountability, about the government that he helped to lead. He was the minister representing that Prime Minister, Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Did he stand up to him? Did he stand up then? But as recently as a few months ago, Senator Birmingham was part of the cover-up that we're now seeing revealed since the change of government. There's the transparency where we can finally see a Prime Minister who was so hellbent on keeping everything secret that he didn't even tell his own cabinet ministers that he had taken over five of their jobs! Five of their jobs he had taken over!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They want to ask questions about a document that does not exist, because we just had a budget in October. How many questions did they actually leave unanswered before they left us? It wasn't just parliamentary questions on notice that were left unanswered; as he left, the Prime Minister had a total of 128 unanswered parliamentary questions on notice. There were 128 that he hadn't answered! And parliamentary questions on notice were just one part of this. The Prime Minister's own department had a total of 391 unanswered questions from Senate estimates—391! So when this group of members of the now opposition come in here and say: 'We need transparency! We need accountability!' we agree. And so do the Australian people. It's why they turfed you lot out and brought us in. They were sick of the deception, they were sick of the lies and they were sick of the cover-ups. Those cover-ups have become clear since we've come into government, had a look at the books and put out a proper budget in October to let the Australian people know what's really going on with the finances of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's not the only thing they covered up. We tried so hard in this place, in this Senate, to hold that government to account. I have notes from a matter of public importance speech that I gave last year. The topic of that debate was the Prime Minister's inability to accept responsibility for any of the failures and policy stuff-ups that had littered his three years in office. The Prime Minister's answer to the car park rorts was, 'The minister made no decision.' His answer to the sports rorts was that it was misleading parliament. His answer about an alleged rape in the ministerial wing was that he had no idea about it. His answer to the bushfires which burnt homes in my home state was, 'I don't hold a hose.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His own members were asking him about what was going on with the government and he hid from them that he had taken over five of their jobs. This is an opposition that has not a leg to stand on when coming in and asking questions of this transparent government, which is telling the truth to the Australian people and isn't hiding behind a Prime Minister who is such a deceiver that he can't even tell his own people what he's doing. The truth has to be told; Senate estimates should follow a traditional procedure and should be available to shadow ministers on the other side to ask questions—no doubt. But this is a stunt, because MYEFO doesn't exist and there is really no need for the review of a document that will not exist— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I rise to take note of the answer to the question to Minister Watt about power generation, something which I know something about. Like some on the other side, I spent the best part of my career working in and around the energy industry, so I know something about it. I would also like to take note of Minister Wong's earlier slur against me when she was comparing me with Senator Rennick. She was in the chamber when I was giving my two-minute speech about my visit to COP27, and how important I thought it was for coalition senators to be there. I didn't see my very good friend Senator Rennick there. I know Senator Cox was there, but I also didn't see her there.</span>

When I last worked with them, while I was consulting, they were a polling firm. I'm sure they've learned a lot about energy policy since then, but I'm not sure how those opposite see that as a viable energy plan. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who starts talking about renewables without talking about firming doesn't know what they're talking about when it comes to energy supply, sovereign energy security and bringing down emissions. The two just aren't the same. None of this can work in isolation. You can't just string wires to some place out in Woop Woop where someone's decided to build a solar farm or a wind farm and think that that's going to give you a good return on your money or not push up power bills. I guarantee you, it will. The $23 billion or $24 billion that was in the budget? Add a zero to that, would be my best estimate. I'm sure I can find ways to cite and prove that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Batteries are not going to be the answer to firming. They're just not. No-one at COP was talking about batteries being a grid-scale firming source. They may be in the future. Hopefully technology will allow them to be. Hopefully China might still sell them to us at some point. Hopefully Australia could even be a manufacturer of our own since we produce a lot of the minerals that are critical for batteries. But at the moment, and in the foreseeable future—out to 2030—they are not going to be grid-scale.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">JP Morgan's annual energy paper stated that putting more renewable energy on the grid will not guarantee lower prices, because energy prices rest on an average cost of generation, not just the actual cost of power. No, it's not just the photons or the knots of wind. It's how it is delivered on a continuous, supported basis. That's the bit that we're not hearing from the other side.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do my homework and I've seen and I've found that there are actually some Australian companies that deserve to be backed and that are producing firming sources that might actually provide grid-scale firming. There are also Australian companies delivering printed solar that we can put at the source of use, not where we want to run some wires to. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  I rise to respond to the line of questioning put by the opposition to the government today with respect to the proposed parliamentary sitting calendar for 2023. We come into this place—and, yes, it is getting very close to the end of the year—in a week when this government has passed and looks likely to be passing some significant legislative reforms, not only with integrity and the NACC bills but also to provide some of the lowest paid workers with some real wage increase opportunities, and an increase in the productivity of this country. Yet those opposite choose to go down a route of distraction, pretending that, somehow, the parliamentary calendar for next year and the way we conduct ourselves in this place is the single-biggest issue of the week. Regardless of what they may say, the reality is that a lot of people who watch this place will be going, 'What on earth are the coalition senators on about?' When their cost of living is going through the roof, you lot come into this place and use our sitting calendar as somehow the biggest political issue of the day. Talk about being in the bubble!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just for the record: as everyone should, always go to the source, or the documents. During question time I went and downloaded this year's calendar from the start of the year—when you lot were in government. I can inform the chamber today that there weren't four weeks of estimates; there were just three weeks of estimates. There is no 25 per cent decrease of estimates. Your government only proposed three weeks of estimates for this year—three weeks only! In addition to that, when you compare it to what this government's proposal is for this chamber, we are sitting on every single Monday—unlike the coalition, who propose that we sit three Mondays less compared to the calendar proposed by the government. In addition to this, this government has also put on the table four additional days on a Friday, if required. Then, on top of that, we have an additional week, making 20 weeks of the year in our sitting calendar—compared to your 19 weeks. It's important we deal with the facts. All you have to do is download the calendar from the start of this year that your lot had proposed and put to this chamber. It is important that we deal with the facts, which is something that the opposition are not very good at doing. They are not very good at dealing with the facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to note—and I know Senator Birmingham has raised these objections with Senator Wong in the chamber and made some interjections earlier—it is the case there won't be a MYEFO this year, and, as has been past practice, there is no need to have that extra week of estimates. That is what the Leader of the Government in the Senate articulated today during question time. That is a very simple explanation as to why we're not having an additional week of estimates, as per the proposed draft before us today. It is important that we always look at what previous governments have done, whether they were Labor or Liberal. It is important that we look at the previous sitting calendars, and it is always important that we look at what the facts are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just wanted to make those few short points today. It is hypocritical, coming from the opposition—who also didn't want to sit on Saturday; they made it very clear they did not want to sit this Saturday to deal with the changes to the Fair Work Act to give the lowest paid workers in this country a pay rise. Your side of politics said 'no way' to sitting longer, 'no way' to giving low-paid workers an increase to their wages.</span>

There's a pattern emerging here from the government. They talked a big game before the election. Then they come into this place, having been elected, slip-sliding away from their promises left, right and centre. There's no mention of the $275 energy price reduction promised by the government in this place anymore. That's gone, and gone with it is any sense of transparency.</span>

I've been here nearly 20 years, Senator Ciccone, and I've never seen a year where there's been only three weeks of estimates. Senator Ciccone, can I tell you, additional estimates in February is not just about MYEFO. It's about annual reports. It's about a range of other documents that are tabled and published in the parliament, so that the Senate can scrutinise those documents and processes. That's what it is about. The government tries to narrow down the target and narrow down the story to suit their rhetoric, but really what's happening is that there is a 25 per cent cut in scrutiny next year.</span>

                  </a>  Senator, your maths is pretty shabby, because normally there's four weeks of estimates in a sitting year. As I said, I've been here a little while and seen a few years and sat around the table for a few years of estimates. It's a 25 per cent cut next year in scrutiny by this government. They said they were going to have more scrutiny, they wanted to be a more open government, they wanted to see more scrutiny, but that's not what we see in practice. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Wong said during her answer to Senator Birmingham's question that we wouldn't answer a question about sports grants in estimates. I sat there through all those estimates as sports minister and I answered every question. I underwent forensic questioning from Senator Farrell at every estimates. I answered every question. So Senator Wong can make the accusation, but I was there. I answered every question. They try to deflect, they try to blame someone else, but at the end of the day they're not interested in scrutiny. They're trying to slide from scrutiny. They talk about us coming to the chamber, which is the process, with support of other parties around the chamber in respect of the sitting schedule. Yet there was no consultation with the opposition with respect to what the sitting schedule might look like. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In circumstances where there have been major changes or significant changes to the way the schedule looked, there's always been consultation. I don't expect Senator Ciccone to understand that. He hasn't had that level of experience in that process. But there have been plenty of occasions when there have been significant changes to the sitting schedule that have been done in consultation, particularly with the opposition, so that we knew that we could get agreement in the chamber and, in fact, sometimes under the threat of using the chamber. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we have this time is a 25 per cent cut in scrutiny through estimates. Additional Fridays, for which there is no standing orders or schedule of programs, so do we get a question time? You can't answer that question. There's no process been undergone there. How come this hasn't been referred to the Procedure Committee so there can be a process? There's no process. It is a complete shambles. The government try to pass it off by saying 'Well, there's no MYEFO so we don't need to do it'. They're not looking at all the processes of the government that are scrutinised in estimates, including annual reports and other reports that are tabled in this place and the opportunity for senators across the whole parliament to scrutinise. We should have that opportunity. They talk about transparency but they don't practice it. There's the secret report that we hear about today about the impacts on the coal industry from the government's policies. They don't want communities to understand what the impacts of those policies are going to be. They talked a big game before the election about what might be, what they might do. They slip and slide, try to blame everybody else. The real pattern is that it's always someone else's fault. It could be the department. What was it we heard the other day? It was a typo in one particular circumstance. They're not prepared to provide the scrutiny and transparency they talked about before the election.</span>

Now, nearly a decade later, Labor is back in power, but what is Labor actually doing to address the crisis and the human rights calamity of the humanitarian nightmare that it actually started nearly a decade ago? You know what the answer is to that? Nothing; Labor is doing nothing to address it. It's been a decade of murder, rape, child sex abuse, armed assault, the deliberate destruction of countless lives and the deliberate denial of the necessities of life—food, drinking water, electricity, medical support. This has been a foul chapter in our country's story—a dark chapter, a bloody chapter, in our country's story—and it's time we wrote the ending to that chapter.

They continue to wash their hands of the people who are in Papua New Guinea, and they continue to abandon the people of Nauru. It's not good enough. This country is a better country than this, and the government must do better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:31</span>):  My question to Minister Watt was very, very clear about Middle Arm, the sustainable precinct in Darwin Harbour. There was $1.9 billion—we heard just right here in this chamber—given through the equity funds. You heard me talk about the fossil fuels and the 75 per cent of emissions that would be released through the Northern Territory on this one project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The name of it suggests that it is a clean energy project. Well, that's 'greenwashing' we know, and actually it's greenwashing that's been government endorsed. They are removing words like 'petrochemicals' from websites in the Northern Territory. The minister couldn't even answer whether they actually had any hand in that, yet, when you go onto the website, it's very clear that they're in partnership—the federal government and the Northern Territory government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been lots of conversations. But they cop some flak, because they go off to COP27 and their minister talks about how great it's been that they co-chaired the global climate fund and are helping other nations but they're not helping First Nations people. Larrakia people, in the Darwin Harbour area, have rejected this actual project. The lack of consultation is unbelievable, and yet this government will not even the answer about the public information that appears on this website that, miraculously, just disappeared weeks ago, and the Minister says, 'Oh, I don't know about that information.' He should maybe have look at the paper one day and see where that information is, because, clearly, they may be asleep at the wheel, just like the last government were.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This project was all part of the gas-fired recovery from COVID. Then we talk about the mangrove alliance. Well, here's Minister Plibersek from the other place, coming out in a joint statement with Minister Bowen, talking about signing up to the Global Mangrove Alliance to protect and restore, and increase mangroves absorbing more carbon to 20 per cent by 2030. Well, you can't do that while you're opening up fossil fuel projects in the same precinct. You cannot do that. You are not going store any carbon doing that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today I introduce the Education and Other Legislation Amendment (Abolishing Indexation and Raising the Minimum Repayment Income for Education and Training Loans) Bill 2022 to tackle the student debt crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let me say right at the start, education is a basic human right. It is not a privilege. TAFE and University should be fully funded by the government and should be fee-free for everyone, whether you are leaving school, changing careers, retraining later in life or looking to gain new skills and knowledge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the current system, students come out of university and TAFE saddled with tens of thousands of dollars of study debt that can take them decades to pay off. More than three million people in Australia are shackled with a total of around $74bn in HELP debt alone. More than 1.5 million of those people have debts greater than $20,000. This is unsustainable and wholly unfair. That's why we went to the last election with a policy to cancel all student debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are in a cost of living crisis. Housing costs have skyrocketed, adding to this burden of study debt. This is having an enormous impact on people's lives, especially young people and women who have borne the brunt of the pandemic and are now bearing the brunt of the cost of living crisis due to rising rents, insecure work and stagnant wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The LNP government's terrible Job-ready graduates package that hiked up Uni fees has only made things worse. Exacerbating the problem is the fact that the Coalition government also passed legislation which significantly lowered the minimum repayment income for student loans and linked indexation of income-contingent student loans to CPI. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's no small problem, millions of people are impacted, and it's not one we can afford to ignore any longer as inflation drives up student debt and the steep cost of living bites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Something needs to be done, and it needs to be done now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My bill gives this Parliament the opportunity to do just that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While, ideally, all student debt should be wiped, this bill is a clear and immediate step to start tackling the student debt crisis while providing cost of living relief to those with a study loan as we work towards the abolition of all student debt and a future where TAFE and university are free for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are two elements to this bill, which will, together, deliver cost of living relief to people with study debts from July next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, the bill immediately halts indexation of all study loans. Currently student debt is indexed by CPI on 1 June each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This June, with inflation skyrocketing, a 3.9% CPI increase was applied to all student debt, adding more than $900 to the average student debt. For many students, that figure was much higher.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">3.9% was the highest indexation rate in a decade. Inflation is at 7.3% now and it has not yet peaked, according to forecasts it's on track to be even worse in 2023. This is such bad news for anyone with a student debt. As the Sydney Morning Herald reported this month "This could mean an increase of nearly $2000 for someone with an average HECS debt of $23,685. Ouch."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ouch, indeed!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">People with a student debt are telling me this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">
                    </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We must stop this pain of ever ballooning student debt. It does nothing but make life harder for so many, just for studying.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill I have introduced immediately stops any indexation of student debts going forward, effectively freezing debt levels and preventing the nasty jump in debts we're headed for next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second part of our bill lifts the current minimum repayment threshold of $48,361 to the median wage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This means that no one with a study debt will repay a cent of that debt until they're earning above the wage of around $62,400. As the median wage rises, so too will the minimum repayment thresholds established by this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This reverses the Liberals' persistent cuts to repayment thresholds that have seen thousands upon thousands of graduates forced to start repaying student loans before they've found their feet and long before they're making a median wage and can afford to make repayments. If the neo-Liberals had not made these terrible changes to drop the minimum repayment income in 2016 and 2018, the minimum repayment income today would be $63,333.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If this bill passes, more than 3.2m people—that's every person with a study debt—will see the benefits of the indexation freeze in this Bill when 1 June comes around. 54% of these people are under forty and just getting started in their post-education lives. About 60% of those who benefit are women.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Someone earning just under what the median wage is expected to be this financial year—would have more than $1,600 extra in their pockets in the 2023-24 tax year alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many who earn above the median wage will also get a hip pocket benefit because the lifted thresholds mean a lower percentage of their income is being withheld for student debt repayments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Anyone earning a median wage or below will never have to make any student debt repayments. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">2.4 million people will benefit from the new repayment thresholds established by this bill, more than 80% of whom are under 40 and more than 60% of whom are women.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The abolition of student debt is not a new idea, nor should it be a controversial one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If US President Joe Biden's mostly boring, mostly centrist government can wipe the student debt of more Americans than Australia has HELP debtors, then we certainly can do better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The cancellation of study debts in the US is a credit to the work of activists and students in the US whose years of work on the issue gave a loud and clear message to the establishment that education should never be a debt sentence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, the last decade has been a particularly tortured time for students and graduates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2016 and again in 2018, fresh from a few failed attempts to jack up Uni fees, the Liberals introduced legislation which significantly lowered the minimum repayment income for student loans to hike the rate and pace of repayments. At the same time they messed with indexation, tying it to CPI instead of wages. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes were as harmful as they were nonsensical. Lowering the minimum repayment income disproportionately affected students and graduates on low-incomes and completely abandoned the principle that students should only begin repaying their debts when they earned roughly the average wage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When 2020 rolled around, the Liberals came back for another go at university fees and funding with the disastrous Job Ready Graduates package which hiked fees on students and cut funding, massively shifting the cost of delivering a university education away from the Government and onto students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fee changes were not small tweaks either. They more than doubled the fees for degrees like arts and commerce to more than fourteen thousand dollars a year. On average, the package drove up fees for women by 10% compared to 6% for men.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With the fee hikes came enormous cuts to teaching and learning funding that have since forced universities to teach more students with less money across the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These cruel funding cuts and fee hikes are further fuelling the explosion in student debt that is hurting students today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill is an opportunity for the Labor government and cross benchers to join the Greens in supporting the interests of students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Once you might have assumed that Labor would have no problems voting for this bill's simple measures to give those with a study debt cost of living relief and make our education system fairer for all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But I fear Labor is no longer the party of Whitlam when it comes to education. They talk a big game from the benches but seem to have fled the field now voters have given them a run. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On this occasion, I would be glad to be proven wrong and very pleased to see Labor support this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When the former Liberal government slashed the minimum repayment income, Labor said the changes were unfair and voted against them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When the Liberals introduced their university fee hikes and funding cuts in 2020, Labor made the correct eleventh hour decision to oppose them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But since then they have been deathly quiet on university funding. They won't even commit to reversing the atrocity of those funding cuts and fee hikes that are seeing universities forced to do more with less while students pay through the nose and face decades of debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So I hope with this bill they take the opportunity to back students, women and other people struggling to pay off their study debts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ballooning student debts and government inaction can't be seen as anything other than punching students and graduates while they're down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The hip pocket harm of having exorbitant student debt repayments withheld from paychecks isn't the only harm we're seeing done by student debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Only recently, we saw renewed testimony from people with study debts and lenders that outstanding HELP debts are preventing people from getting finance to be able to purchase a home or severely limiting the amount that they are able to borrow. It's tough enough as it is to find secure housing. Allowing the problem of student debt to go unaddressed will only make it worse in the months and years to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Even if there were no cost of living crisis, we have to be clear on the principle that underscores all our efforts for free public education and an end to student debt:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Now that we are no longer weighed down by the Liberal's attacks on the very idea of public education and training, it's time we began the work of rebuilding our education system. I won't ever miss the opportunity to remind the Government that a majority awaits them in the Senate for ambitious measures that look to the future and advance the cause of higher education and training as a universal public good, built on the principles of equity and democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the Greens part, we are proudly the party of public education. We know that education at every level should be free, fully funded and properly resourced, with staff who are paid properly, valued and respected for the incredible work they do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill is one of the pieces of the puzzle in making that vision a reality.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, I would like to acknowledge the work of my former Queensland Nationals colleague and Member for Dawson, George Christensen, for all the work he did on a previous version of this Bill. I undertook to carry on that work because this issue is so important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To protect its most vulnerable, in 1990, Australia ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Article 6 of the convention commits Australia to recognising that every child has the inherent right to life; and ensuring to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Article 24 of the convention commits Australia to recognising the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. Our nation has signed up to striving to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to such health care services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, Article 24 says Australia shall take appropriate measures to diminish infant and child mortality. In short, Australia has committed to every child having the right to life, every child having access to health care and reducing the deaths of babies. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Yet, in this nation, potentially hundreds of babies are born alive as a result of abortion procedures without any significant subsequent intervention. Our most vulnerable are simply left to die. In preparing this Bill, George asked the Parliamentary Library to do some research. Despite sketchy data, they found, that in a single year, 33 babies aborted after 20 weeks gestation were born alive in Victoria while, in Queensland, 204 babies were born alive as a result of abortions over a 10-year period. In fact, in Queensland, the problem is systemic with Queensland Health's Clinical Guidelines for Termination of Pregnancy stating: 'If [during an abortion] a live birth occurs… Do not provide life sustaining treatment… Document the time and date of death.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">How is this policy, how are these deaths, in accordance with our international obligation as a nation to every child having the right to life, every child having access to health care and reducing the deaths of babies?

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think abortion is an evil. It results in the death of a child and often ongoing mental harm for a parent. I would rather no child be aborted in this country or elsewhere. But whether you are pro-life or so-called pro-choice, I do not know that anyone, but the most cold-blooded sociopath, who could say that a child born alive is not a child and thus does not have any rights. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this bill, breaching that duty would incur a penalty and there is a new obligation for medical practitioners to report to the Federal Department of Health on children born alive as a result of abortions. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">George commissioned a survey by the recognised polling company YouGov before he initially introduced this Bill to the House. The survey found that support for a Bill such as this one is extremely strong across all sectors of the community. More than three times as many people support care for these babies than oppose care. The majority of people expect any baby should be afforded medical care, regardless of the circumstances of their birth. It is a view shared by people aged 18 to 34 and those aged over 65. It's a view shared by both men and women, and those living in the inner city and the outer regions. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some have tried to claim—quite falsely—that this bill would require doctors, under threat of penalty, to keep non-viable babies alive. This is not true. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Section 9 of the bill states that the medical care and treatment to be provided to a baby born alive as a result of an abortion to be commensurate to the circumstances, not including the fact that they were born as a result of a termination and goes on to state that this could be life-saving treatment or, indeed, palliative care as the case may be. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some have said this bill would keep babies alive that have congenital deformities. Well, again, only if the baby was viable. And if the baby was viable but had congenital deformities, which is another way of saying the baby was born with disabilities, what is the problem? Are people saying that children born with disabilities should be left to die? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Others have claimed that this bill perpetuates a myth that children are born alive a result of abortions. The data available via the Parliamentary Library shows that to be a false claim, but even if that claim was correct—which it is not—what harm would this bill do? If no viable child is ever born alive as a result of an abortion, then this bill has no effect. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But if one child, just one, was born alive in such circumstances and that child was viable then this bill would not only have an effect, but it would be more important than probably most laws on the books because it would save a life that otherwise would have been discarded like it was medical waste. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fact is there is little to argue against in this bill, unless of course an objector felt that a baby born alive as a result of an abortion should be left to die because it was born as a result of an abortion. Such a position would be in contravention of our international obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Specifically, Article 6 of that convention, which states that "Australia recognises: … that every child has the inherent right to life. And "Australia: … shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, Article 24 of that convention, states that "Australia recognises: … the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. And Australia: … shall strive to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to such health care services." And "Australia: … shall pursue full implementation of this right and (specifically) shall take appropriate measures … to diminish infant and child mortality."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Every death of a viable baby born alive as a result of an abortion that occurs in Australia means that the fundamental rights of a child enshrined in this UN convention are absent in this country. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This needs to be remedied. Lives need to be saved. This Bill, the Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill 2022, seeks to protect the most vulnerable in our society. </span>

Senator Henderson's attempts to obtain certain details of ABC salaries echo previous attempts by One Nation and smack of a personal vendetta against the ABC. The government supports transparency and accountability with respect to the ABC, and, as a Commonwealth entity, the ABC already discloses executive remuneration in its annual report in accordance with its obligations under the PGPA Act. The ABC also conducts an annual gender pay equity review and reports this in its annual report.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a few remarks with leave of the Senate to explain the changes that we've made. I thank colleagues for discussing the Senate program and the estimates hearings. We have been working with senators to tweak the program that was circulated constructively, as Senator Chisholm said. The original program did not have estimates in February, as there had not been a MYEFO since the budget. The budget served as the MYEFO. The estimates hearings are being conducted, and in fact they're still underway. The next scheduled estimates would be after the budget. However, we have responded to the feedback from the Senate that they would like estimates in February. The government will agree to that. So one of the amendments is to have the week of 13 February to Friday 17 February removed as a sitting week and inserted as estimates. I would like to thank Senator Hanson-Young for discussions about how to accommodate the wishes of the Senate for an extra estimates week. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a further amendment which would move the June sittings up by a week and also remove the 'if required' out of that final sitting week in December. I thank colleagues for constructively engaging where they have. We've been able to respond as much as we can to get a sitting program for next year that meets everybody's needs, ensures we can get the business done and that we're responding to the wishes of the Senate for an extra estimates week.</span>

Imagine the even greater outrage if this was done, along with other unprecedented changes to the sitting schedule, without any consultation having occurred across the chamber. The outrage would have been off the Richter scale from Labor and the Greens. While we have seen in question time yesterday and today Senator Wong show a level of outrage at being questioned over the sitting schedule, I welcome this tweak, as the Manager of Government Business has described it, to the government's program. That's more than a tweak. Let me welcome this backflip and capitulation by the government to reinstate the four weeks of Senate estimates. They should never have sought to axe it.

This attempt to axe a week was clearly an attempt by the government to take an axe to the conventional transparency and accountability processes and procedures of the Senate. It was extraordinary to see the Greens also play patsy to this attempt to erode Senate accountability, but I do thank all six crossbench senators for standing firm with the coalition in support of Senate conventions. I acknowledge and welcome the government's backflip and, with that, indicate the opposition will not be proceeding with the amendments circulated in my name. </span>

                    </a>  The Greens will not be supporting this referral. First up, I want trans and gender diverse people, especially young people, to know: we see you, we hear you and you are loved, and you deserve to feel safe and supported. Instead, Senator Hanson is using you as a political football to manufacture outrage. The Royal Australian College of Physicians gave advice in 2020 about whether there was a need for an inquiry into the care and treatment of trans and gender diverse children and young people. They found a national inquiry would only harm vulnerable young people. They supported the current guidelines for care and found that limiting health care for such a vulnerable group would be unethical, and, further, that gender-affirming health care for trans and gender diverse people should be a national priority. So, no, we do not need such a Senate inquiry.</span>

This monitor reports on the committee's consideration of 50 legislative instruments registered between 8 and 21 October 2022. It also details the committee's ongoing consideration of instruments registered in previous periods, and the instruments for which it has decided to conclude its examination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would firstly like to highlight the committee's scrutiny of the Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response) (Hawking of Financial Products) Regulations 2021. This instrument amends the Corporations Regulations to create exemptions to the prohibition of hawking financial products set out in the Corporations Act. The committee engaged extensively with the former Treasurer regarding its concerns about parliamentary oversight in this instrument. The committee raised concerns that this instrument, made by the executive, creates exemptions to the primary law on an ongoing basis as it is also exempt from the sunsetting regime. It's the committee view that the modifications to exemptions from primary law should be set out in the primary law itself. When these measures are in delegated legislation, the committee expects they will be time limited to ensure frequent parliamentary oversight. This would also provide the executive with the ability to assess whether the measures remain appropriate and necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee raised its concerns about parliamentary oversight with the former Treasurer on four occasions, without resolution. The committee continued to raise the matter with the new Assistant Treasurer. I'm pleased to report that yesterday the committee received an undertaking from the Assistant Treasurer that the instrument will be amended so that it ceases to operate within three years. This will facilitate greater parliamentary oversight of these measures. I thank the Assistant Treasurer and officials from the department for their constructive engagement with the committee. The committee has now concluded its consideration of this longstanding matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second matter I would like to draw to the attention of the chamber is the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter‑Terrorism Financing Rules Amendment Instrument 2021. This instrument also contains measures which insert an ongoing exemption from primary legislation. The committee first raised its concerns with the former Minister for Home Affairs on two occasions, but unfortunately, the issue was not resolved. The committee raised the matter with the new Attorney-General, requesting that the measures either be moved into the primary legislation or, at a minimum, be time limited to five years to facilitate greater parliamentary scrutiny. I'm pleased to advise that, on 18 November, the Attorney-General undertook to amend the instrument so that the exemptions it inserts cease within five years of commencement. He also indicated that the exemptions may be revisited to determine if they are still necessary. On this basis, the committee was able to conclude its consideration of this instrument, and I thank the Attorney-General for his continued engagement with the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee will continue to carefully scrutinise delegated legislation which contains ongoing measures that modify or create exemptions to primary legislation, noting that parliamentary oversight is a key consideration for the committee under the standing orders. With these comments, I commend the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Delegated </span><span style="font-style:italic;">legislation monitor</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> No. 9 of 2022</span> to the Senate.</span>

The addendum to the explanatory memorandum also includes welcome guidance in relation to the sensitive information framework and the disclosure of personal information.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee also welcomes the omission of paragraph 8(1)(e) from the bill in response to the committee's questions in relation to the retrospective application of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I thank the Attorney-General for his careful consideration of the committee's advice. This is a clear example of how the committee's technical scrutiny of bills assists the Parliament in undertaking its legislative function. However, while the committee welcomes the inclusion of this additional information in the explanatory materials, the committee considers that many of these issues would have been more appropriately addressed through amendments to the bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee remains concerned about several scrutiny issues, including the abrogation of the privilege of self-incrimination and legal professional privilege without appropriate legislative safeguards, evidentiary certificates that may relate to substantive matters, provisions which provide the Commissioner with broad powers to delegate their functions, powers or duties, the conferral of broad immunity from civil liability and the reversal of the evidential burden of proof where the relevant evidence does not appear to be limited to the knowledge of the defendant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee also remains concerned about the exclusion of certain decisions from judicial review. For example, the committee has noted in Digest 8 that decisions that do not appear to be intermediate decisions, such as the Commissioner's jurisdiction-conferring power under clause 40, are excluded from judicial review under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977</span>.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Noting the significance of this legislation, it is unfortunate that these technical scrutiny issues could not be resolved prior to the passage of the bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I also wish to highlight the committee's initial comments on the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Crimes Amendment (Penalty Unit) Bill 2022. </span>I note that this bill passed both Houses of Parliament earlier this week before the committee had completed its scrutiny process. I therefore take this opportunity to highlight the importance of allowing sufficient time for the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills to undertake full and detailed</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">scrutiny prior to the passage of legislation. When bills are passed quickly, as was the case here, there may be insufficient time to properly consider the implications of proposed legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill increases the amount of a single Commonwealth penalty unit from $222 to</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">$275 from 1 January 2023. This represents an increase of close to 24% and will occur <span style="font-weight:bold;">in addition to </span>the prescribed indexation process, which automatically increases the amount of a penalty unit every three years in line with the consumer price index.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The increase would apply across the majority of Commonwealth civil and criminal penalty provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Despite the significance of this increase, the explanatory memorandum to the bill does not adequately explain how the amount of the increase was arrived at, or why an increase of this size is considered both necessary and appropriate. The committee has therefore resolved to seek the Attorney-General's advice about these matters.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">With these comments, I commend the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny Digest 8 of 2022 </span>to the Senate.</span>

                  </a>  I thank the Senate. I first acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we gather and pay my respects to elders past, present and emerging, and I pay tribute to the First Nations parliamentarians here in the chamber for their leadership and contribution. I will speak but briefly, as Senator Dodson and Senator McCarthy will speak for the government today because it is important that First Nations parliamentarians have their voice and perspective heard and that we all listen.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make some brief points. Whilst the Closing the Gap report shows there has been some progress, on the majority of measures progress has been slow and even gone backwards. This government takes responsibility for where we go from here and for doing better. As the Prime Minister said today, so-called solutions conceived in Canberra and imposed on communities without consultation are more likely than not to end in expensive, ineffective, even counterproductive failure, but when First Nations people have a genuine say in policy design and an empowered role in service delivery, the results are remarkable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is a government that listens to people with experience, with earned knowledge of kinship and country, of culture and community, and it is this which underlines our commitment to the full implementation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, including a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament to empower First Nations people to take control of their own lives, not have policies and laws dictated to them by politicians. The Voice is about enabling a better future, a future in which the lives of Indigenous people in the community are improved, to achieve better outcomes in health, in education, in housing and to close the gap. That is why we believe it is so important that the call from First Nations to be heard and to have a voice is answered by Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth government's first annual report under the National Agreement on Closing the Gap shows we have a lot of work to do. While has been some progress, the previous government's efforts over the last decade in government have been very ineffectual. Progress across most socioeconomic outcomes has stalled. While the national agreement and the partnership with the Coalition of Peaks provides a helpful architecture, the previous government's implementation leaves much to be desired.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming into government just six months ago, our government has demonstrated our commitment to improving outcomes for First Nations peoples. In the October 2022 budget, we locked in significant investments across portfolios, seeking to address these disproportionate outcomes. We are investing in First Nations health workers, vital health infrastructure and community led justice reinvestment initiatives. In all of these commitments, we are working with First Nations peoples. This concept of working with First Nations peoples to make decisions about policies and programs so that they are more effective is not new. I and many other leaders have been talking about this for decades. It is grounded in the evidence: outcomes for our people are simply better when we have a say, have a choice and make decisions about our lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national agreement provides one piece of architecture to improve outcomes, and my colleagues will work with this framework to continue important progress across the socioeconomic areas. But to achieve better outcomes, after a decade of stagnation, we must fundamentally change how governments work with First Nations peoples. We cannot allow these outcomes to continue in this way. That is only a shame on governments for failing to listen to First Nations communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To make meaningful and lasting change and progress requires systemic and structural transformation of how we are going to go about it on all sides of government. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to the parliament and to the government will do exactly that. Our government is steadfast in the commitment to the full implementation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart because we know that it will lead to better outcomes for First Nations communities. That very statement calls for constitutional reform through a voice so that First Nations children can flourish. The Voice will give our people a real opportunity to advise the parliament and the government on how to do things for the better of our people. After 250 years, that's not such a bad idea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Voice to Parliament will be a significant shift for our nation, a structural change that will lead to better outcomes for our people and all Australians. To take the two concepts of closing the gap and the Voice to Parliament as mutually exclusive is flawed and misses the point.</span>

The new implementation plan provides new targets established in genuine partnership with First Nations peoples, including, notably, the Coalition of Peaks, who I again thank for their detailed work through that process. It also includes state and territory governments, who play a critical role in delivering outcomes in Indigenous communities right across Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The intent of the changes that were made to the Closing the Gap targets and the process of measuring them was to ensure that enhanced granularity of programs and targets to close the gap across areas of health, education, life expectancy and the range of different measures applied were even more measurable, even more effectively verifiable, so that we are able to ensure better progress of policies against those targets. When the former Prime Minister released the plan last year, it included $1 billion in new measures across a range of Commonwealth programs and strategies to help to ensure the actions across all areas of national government work towards closing the gap and achieving what we all seek: to improve the lives and circumstances of our First Australians and to see young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children having the same health, education and employment opportunities as anyone else in Australia, so that they too can share the same hopes and the same aspirations for their own future and for that of their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that we see today the first <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ap </span>report to measure against the new priorities and the new, more granular targets which reflect very genuinely the input from First Australians to establish those targets and priorities. Sadly, though, yet again we have to acknowledge that there is still much more to do. In too many areas we are still not making progress, or are even going backwards. School readiness, adult incarceration rates and suicide rates are all statistics that paint a bleak and continually concerning picture. They must provide a clarion call to all of us across the Australian parliament, and in state and territory parliaments, to redouble our collective efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we should not overlook improvement where it has been achieved. To actually highlight improvements is to try to enhance confidence in the processes and policies applied by governments to seek to close the gap. Healthier birth weights, more children enrolled in preschool, fewer young people in detention—these are important steps forward. We should celebrate those steps and seek to redouble progress on them, but make sure in doing so that we say to Australians, 'We can make a difference and we can make progress when we work together and apply those policies.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In acknowledging those gains I pay tribute to those who work every day with individuals and across communities, from inner cities suburbs through to the remotest parts of our country, to deliver the outcomes that the policy actions of governments seek to achieve. I reaffirm to the Senate the commitment made by the Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for Indigenous affairs in the House to work with the government on addressing the challenge to truly close the gap. Together we must continue to act to ensure specific and detailed policies are delivered to close the many gaps that continue to exist. That may mean, sometimes, difficult conversations. It may mean, sometimes, doing things that don't necessarily fit neatly into our own party's policy agendas. After many decades of effort by parties of both sides when in government, we know that closing the gap has no simple answer and no easy solutions. That is why we must persevere, persist and, where necessary, adapt policies to make sure that progress is made and improved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If in the years to come we can stand here—but more importantly than standing here, stand alongside Indigenous Australians—and acknowledge a list of improvements against the Closing the Gap targets and, more importantly, a list of improvements in their lives and their children's and grandchildren's lives, then that will have been an effort well worthwhile.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  As the Greens leader in the Senate I pay respects to the First Nations owners of this land, over which sovereignty was never ceded. So it is, it was and it will always be Aboriginal land. I acknowledge and pay respect to all First Nations members of this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to take note of the deeply disappointing results of the annual <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ap </span>report. We are not closing the gap anywhere near fast enough, and on many indicators have, shamefully, gone backwards. We know and acknowledge that the injustices we see documented in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ap </span>report are symptoms of colonisation. First Nations people are wearing the consequences of racist decisions that successive governments in this country have made. It is on all Australians, but especially those of us in this chamber, to right the wrongs that started with invasion and the absence of treaty, and continue through child removal, incarceration and suicide. The rate of First Nations child removal is at an all-time high. Survivors of the Stolen Generations are now witnessing a new generation of First Nations children being stolen from their families and communities. The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines forcibly transferring children of one group to another group as an act of genocide. Implementing the recommendations from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home </span>report will keep First Nations kids with First Nations families. These are self-determined solutions that successive governments have ignored for 25 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aggressive policing results in too many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people being locked up in prisons who do not have independent oversight to safeguard their human rights. Systemic racism in our policing and legal system is compounded by the low age of criminal responsibility, exposing kids as young as 10 to the trauma of prison and a criminal record. Sixty-five per cent of children in prison across Australia are First Nations kids. Our minimum age of criminal responsibility is out of line with international jurisdictions and out of line with our human rights obligations. We must urgently raise the age to at least 14 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 40 per cent of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody are about social factors—things like education, health and housing. Access to basic human rights will stop First Nations people from going to prison in the first place. Successive governments have ignored this advice for 31 years. If the Albanese government are committed to hearing and acting on advice from First Nations people they will implement all the recommendations from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and listen to calls from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to raise the age of criminal responsibility. This is urgent, and it's overdue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations people are resorting to self-harm, because they cannot see a future for themselves in this system. The continuing high rate of suicide shows that structural racism and the policies made for First Nations people but not by them is killing First Nations people. Often they don't have access to their land, water or sacred sites or even their own children. This is up to us to change. We've inherited a centuries-old regime written entirely by white men that has not undertaken any fundamental change since colonisation. We know the confronting truth: the basis of the Australian nation was terra nullius and the idea that First Nations people didn't need human rights or decision-making power because they were subhuman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an opportunity to do things differently in this country. A national grassroots treaty process will close the gap by restoring First Nations people's rights to make decisions for themselves. We know that self-determined solutions work, because Aboriginal people know what's best for Aboriginal communities. Everyone thrives when they are free to set their own course. On this, there must be a standalone national plan to end violence against First Nations women and children that is developed, delivered and evaluated by First Nations women and community controlled organisations. I'm pleased that work on this has begun. Adequate funding must be allocated to get it done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite ongoing injustice, First Nations people are strong and capable. A national treaty process puts First Nations people in the driver's seat when it comes to making decisions about their own country, community and culture. We are one of the only Commonwealth countries that doesn't have a treaty with First Nations people. It was promised by Bob Hawke's Labor government in the eighties. First Nations elders and activists have marched for it for decades. In this term of government the Greens will work for progress on truth, treaty and voice to meaningfully close the gap.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Vic</span><span class="HPS-Electorate">toria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  I rise as Leader of the Nationals in the Senate to also take note of the Closing the Gap statement and to put our views on how that is proceeding—or how the report, currently as it has been tabled, isn't proceeding as quickly, as swiftly as we would like but, more importantly, as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders need to occur in this country. Today is a day when, as we do each time this report is tabled, we take stock as a collective group of national leaders of how we can better work together to improve the life outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It's underpinned by the belief that when Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a genuine say in the design and delivery of policies, programs and services that affect them then better life outcomes are achieved. All Australian governments are committed to working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their communities, organisations and businesses to help achieve better outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But today we have to acknowledge that four out of 18 means that 12 out of 18 aren't going in the right direction. So we all need to put our shoulder harder into that wheel to work better with state and territory governments, with local governments and with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peak organisations so that the policies that are thought of and designed hit the ground in those communities and really change the dial. In terms of changes that we made whilst we were in government, we did take the practical step of creating the joint ministerial council, led by the national Coalition of Peaks, to inform the work with government and develop the evolving target areas, which was so critical to changing the way we looked at achieving the Closing the Gap targets. In order to maintain the momentum of the national agreement's transformative agenda, we've got to foster and enhance those partnership principles. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the party of rural and regional Australia, if you look at the latest statistics from the ABS, the 20 electorates that have the most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in them as a proportion of population are all in rural and regional Australia, all 20 of them. Lingiari has 40 per cent. Parkes, represented by Mark Coulton in the other place, has 16 per cent. Mark Coulton, a National Party MP, represents more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders than he does farmers. So it's about making sure that we constructively work with whoever is in government and that we are in partnerships at the state government level. That is critical for changing the dial for the people that we represent as the party of rural and regional Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got to look at the education piece. We've got to get kids into school. We've got to get great teachers into schools in remote areas to really back those young people's future opportunities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We created Supply Nation, the procurement policy, while we were in government, with $5.3 billion that went into tens of thousands of contracts. Small businesses partnered with local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in great jobs right across the country. That was a way to take a creative gambit, if you like, to change the dial, and it did. I would like to pay tribute to the former minister in this space Nigel Scullion and thank him for that work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to working however we can with the current government constructively to close the gap over their time on the Treasury benches, and we have all got to do better. There is no other way to say it. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  I rise to respond to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the Gap</span> report. This is the first report since the establishment of the new National Agreement on Closing the Gap. Once again, it makes for disappointing and frustrating reading. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that some targets are on track: more babies born at a healthy weight, and more kids enrolled in preschool. This is very welcome news. However, many targets are not on track, and in some areas the gap has widened. These include incarceration rates, children in and out of home care, getting children school-ready and tragically, suicide rates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation supports the new approach in the National Agreement on Closing the Gap in principle, primarily because there was some focus on empowering Indigenous Australians to take equal responsibility for its outcomes. We have hope that this approach will chip away at the insidious culture of victimhood unjustly imposed on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We concede that it is early days, but you will forgive my cynicism at the ultimate impact of this new approach, considering the uncounted billions of dollars thrown at these issues for many years, with little positive effect. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless, closing the gaps is an urgent priority for this entire nation. It is appalling that any defined demographic of Australians is so obviously disadvantaged. One Nation looks forward to a future when this disadvantage has been overcome, when we are no longer divided or separated by race in any respect, and when every individual Australian's opportunities and prospects are no longer defined by race. We will never close the gaps as long as we continue to indulge in the identity politics of racial division and separatism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why it is critical that all Australian people unite to stand against it, and they can do so by voting no in the coming referendum on the proposed Voice to Parliament. Given the urgency to close the gaps, it is only fair to question why the Albanese government is prioritising such an expensive and divisive proposal, especially considering there is absolutely no compelling evidence the Voice will help to close the gap. It is only fair to question if the Albanese government is ignoring a growing chorus of Australian voices, including prominent Indigenous voices, opposing the voice to parliament. It is only fair to question why the Prime Minister did not, apparently, seek legal advice before proposing his amendment to the Constitution. This draft amendment is of tremendous concern for the future governance of Australia, because it threatens to unleash a wave of repeated constitutional crises. Constitutional legal minds much finer than those of Anthony Albanese or Mark Dreyfus have, for months, been warning the Prime Minister's draft amendment is absolutely ripe for this potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have seen unfolding this week, this debate is not only causing further division between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians it is dividing Indigenous Australia itself. Noel Pearson has been at the forefront of the yes cause, pedalling the transparent lie that the voice is necessary because Indigenous Australians are not recognised in their country. This week he has bullied and attacked Senator Price for her stance on the voice, accusing her of being used to punch down on other Aboriginals. I was disgusted, but not especially surprised, by this deeply personal and racist attack on a woman who has articulated practical and sensible concerns about the voice. Mr Pearson would do well to consider that Senator Price's election to the Senate shows our Constitution and system of government are no barriers to Indigenous representation. And the Prime Minister will do well to pay close attention to the fracturing of the Australian electorate and the deep divisions being created by this proposal to give greater political franchise to a minority of Australians based solely on race. One Nation proudly stands against enshrining racial exceptionalism in the founding document of Australia. We will be campaigning strongly for the no vote so that Australia can move forward together, united as one people and one nation under one flag.</span>

To the woman who intervened in the life of her own son and his five children and knew that if she didn't step in to take those children herself then they too would be removed into the care of the system that so many First Nations people dread, the system of welfare and the system that removes children, as we've seen with stolen generations—and redress now—the system that still drives a lot of fear in the hearts of many mothers. To the woman who stepped into that intervention and worked with her other son to take those five children and to try and care for them. She still struggles, and her story is emulated across the country, but she did it because she did not want her grandchildren to be part of these statistics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the grandmother who knew that her grandbabies were with foster carers and those foster carers, in the community, had raised those babies for about three or four years. The foster carers now, after nearly five years, want to return to where they come from, after living in the community and teaching in the community and caring for so many children there. They've asked to be able to take those children so that they can care for them interstate. So the grandmothers had a meeting and a gathering to talk about what this means for these children and the kinship care. How will they still understand culture? How will they still understand their language and know that they are so deeply loved but just cannot be cared for? That was an important step in the self-determination of those grandmothers, who had known that this was going to be the best way for their grandbabies, so that those children will come back and forwards knowing where they come from in an environment of love. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those health workers, health practitioners right across Australia, to many of you whom I've met in my short time in the ministry as assistant minister in Indigenous health, we have a terrific opportunity to move even harder on improving these statistics. I am ever so conscious that this is the first time I'm speaking to this report from government. I am ever so conscious that I stand with my colleagues in government to try to improve the lives of First Nations people through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ap</span> report. I do thank the parliament of Australia for the many, many years that we have had Closing the Gap—not because I'm proud of any of the reports or the statistics, but because you continuously shine a light on what we know out there in our communities still desperately needs this parliament to never forget. That is to improve the lives of the most vulnerable. We fumble about it in our very imperfect ways, but I do believe there is a genuine desire to make sure these statistics get lower and lower each year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the minister for Indigenous health, I say to all those in the health sector out there, I am heartened by the fact that we can move now on the renal dialysis units; on the 500 health practitioners that we want to employ in these positions across the country; on the fact that we're going to focus on rheumatic heart disease and really try to eliminate this scourge. I do hope the next time I stand on my feet here I can have something really strong to say. Thank you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has worked with the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council and the broader Wreck Bay community over a number of years to co-design the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Amendment (Strengthening Land and Governance Provisions) Bill 2022, with the most recent consultations on the detail of the Bill in August this year.

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Wreck Bay community is located in the Jervis Bay Territory, on the southern New South Wales coast, 126 kilometres east of Canberra. The Jervis Bay Territory was formally established in 1915, on the land of the Bherwerre Peninsula, through the enactment of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915</span>. Of course, First Nations people had been living in the area since long before that time, and never agreed to the surrender of these lands. Middens on the Bherwerre Peninsula provide evidence of thousands of generations of First Nations occupation of the area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">During the 1960s and 1970s, members of the community advocated for the recognition of their connection to their land in Australian law. This advocacy culminated in the enactment of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act 1986</span>. The Act established the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council to hold title to Aboriginal Land in the Jervis Bay Territory, to manage that land for the benefit of the community, and to advocate for and serve the community more generally. There have been three declarations of Aboriginal Land since 1987. Today, more than 90 per cent of the land in the Jervis Bay Territory is Aboriginal Land owned and managed by the Council. Much of that land is Booderee National Park, which is leased back to the Director of National Parks and is jointly managed by the Council and the Director of National Parks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill ensures that the Council is well positioned to hold and manage this land for the benefit of the Council's members for generations to come. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill enhances local control over decision making by increasing the amount the Council can agree to spend under a contract without obtaining Ministerial approval. This amount will increase from $100,000 to $1 million, empowering the Council to pursue commercial ventures without having to navigate unnecessary red tape. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill assists the Council to issue home ownership style leases to individuals in the community. If community members wish to do so, they will be able to take out a home ownership style lease. This will simplify arrangements for long-term leasing and provide opportunity for community members to enjoy the intergenerational benefits of home ownership. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill strengthens the Council's governance structures, aligning them more closely with those of comparable corporate Commonwealth entities. The powers of the Council will be vested in the Board; until now, the Council's members have had to delegate powers to the Board, creating uncertainty within the Council. The Board and the Chief Executive Officer will be explicitly empowered to delegate functions and powers so the Council can function effectively. The Bill also ensures only fit and proper persons may serve on the Board, and changes quorum requirements from set numbers to percentages of overall members, ensuring responsiveness to changes in overall membership numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the Bill updates the title of the Act to the "Aboriginal Land and Waters (Jervis Bay Territory) Act 1986". This name reflects the Council's ownership of an area of the waters of Jervis Bay, as well as freshwater sources across the Jervis Bay Territory. It recognises the community's strong connection to waters as well as land, and the importance of the Act in supporting that enduring connection into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's Closing the Gap commitment to shared decision-making has guided the development of these reforms. Targeted co-design sessions were held in 2020 and 2021, including with the Council's Board, men's and women's groups, subcommittees, elders, youth, and the broader membership. Some reforms were proposed by the community, others were suggested by Government, and every reform in this Bill has been explicitly endorsed by the Board. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the work that occurred under the former Minister for Indigenous Australians, the Honourable Ken Wyatt, in progressing this important work with the Wreck Bay community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government sincerely thanks the Council for its work in the co-design of this Bill. In particular, we acknowledge the leadership of Annette Brown and Julie Moore, who have chaired the Council during the co-design process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Council's work honours the longstanding tradition of community service and representation in Wreck Bay. Those who advocated for land rights in the late twentieth century paved the way for the present generation to maintain their deep connection to their land and waters. This Bill ensures that the Wreck Bay community will continue to live their culture through this enduring connection for generations to come.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  Acting Deputy President Sterle, I note how keen you were to take the chair for my speech in continuation tonight! You wore one of your favourite ties for the occasion!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to talk about some of the specific provisions in this bill, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022, and my concern about the drafting of the bill. Bear in mind that this legislation is going to impact small and medium-sized businesses across this country, many of whom do not have a dedicated human resources function or an in-house legal function to give them advice. We've heard during the debate over the last few weeks that the government's estimate of consultant or adviser fees of $175 an hour, as provided in the regulation impact statement, is simply underdone, undercooked—not accurate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that small and medium-sized businesses who want to get legal advice or industrial relations advocacy advice in relation to these measures which they are going to have to comply with are looking at a cost—just for a junior adviser or consultant—in the region of $350 an hour, at least twice as much as the government has estimated in its regulatory impact statement. That is deeply concerning. If you are going to change the law and put a cost imposition on small and medium-sized businesses, work out what the cost is appropriately. As has been said by my friend Senator Brockman in the course of this debate—I did exactly the same as Senator Brockman. I rang a small business that provides industrial advocacy services in my home state, in Brisbane, and I was told that, for a junior, it was $350 an hour and, for someone more senior, between $400 and $500 an hour. Yet we have a regulatory impact statement which refers to an estimate of $175 an hour. That is very disappointing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to some of the drafting of the bill. A key clause is in relation to what constitutes a common interest, because it's under this definition that small and medium-sized enterprises may be dragged into an industrial relations dispute. This is what the definition says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(ii), examples of common interests—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that's the key definition, common interests—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">that employers may have include the following: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) a geographical location; </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) the nature of the enterprises to which the agreement will relate, and the terms and conditions of employment in those enterprises; </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(c) being substantially funded, directly or indirectly, by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's up to the Fair Work Commission to decide, on the basis of those criteria in the bill, whether or not there is a common interest. We then turn to the explanatory memorandum. For those listening to the debate, the explanatory memorandum is meant to explain what the provisions in the bill actually mean. This is what it tells us:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Subsection 243(2) would provide examples of common interests that employers may have. This includes the geographical location of the employers, the nature of the enterprises to which the agreement will relate, and the terms and conditions of employment …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the explanatory memorandum simply restates what's actually in the bill. It doesn't explain anything. It just restates what's in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what is one to make of the phrase 'a geographical location'? Every business in this country is at a geographical location. Putting aside the fact that a location needs to be geographical—I'm not sure what else it can be—what does that mean? Are we talking about businesses which are adjacent to each other or in close proximity within a shopping centre, for example? Are we talking about a suburb? Are we talking about a region? For example, is Mount Isa considered a geographical location for the purposes of this test, or would it be north-west Queensland, regional Queensland or the state of Queensland? What is the actual geographical location we're talking about that triggers this test? There is absolutely no guidance whatsoever to the Fair Work Commission as to what this means in practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we turn to the second link, the nature of the enterprises. Again, as is the case with a geographical location, the explanatory memorandum just regurgitates what's in the bill. It doesn't actually give a definition as to what 'nature of the enterprises' means—absolutely no guidance whatsoever. So, paragraph (a), a geographical location: well, I can tell you, every single business in this country is located at a geographical location. So where does that lead us?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the second part, the 'nature of the enterprises'—again, no explanation as to what that means. Then you go to the regulatory impact statement—the famous regulatory impact statement that undercooks the cost of consultants that small and medium-size businesses are going to have to engage by at least 50 per cent—to see what this means. I go to the case study, which is contained on page 53 of the regulatory impact statement. This is how they think this should work in practice:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">10 medium-sized fish and chip shops with seafood processing plants in Queensland have decided or been compelled to bargain together in the single interest stream.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to repeat that: '10 medium-sized fish and chip shops with seafood processing plants'—I'm assuming that they're not saying that each of the 10 medium-sized fish and chip shops has its own seafood processing plant. I'm assuming they're not intending to imply that. I'm assuming they're intending to imply that each of these 10 fish and chip shops sources its seafood from an external supplier. So, our 10 medium-sized fish and chip shops with seafood processing plants in Queensland 'have decided or been compelled'—at least the regulatory impact statement is honest in that regard—'to bargain together in the single-interest stream'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the life of me, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle—and you are extremely well experienced in industrial relations matters—I cannot see any similarity whatsoever with respect to industrial relations issues between a medium-sized fish and chip shop that is a retail shop, that is outward facing—it presumably would be more busy during hours when people are going to get their fish and chips—and a seafood processing plant, which is processing seafood that has been caught. Where is the similarity? How in goodness's name would our 10 proprietors of the medium-sized fish and chip shop sit down with the general managers or owners of the seafood processing plant and with the unions and come up with any coherent enterprise agreement? How?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is madness. And this is the case study in the regulatory impact statement—10 medium-sized fish and chip shops getting together with the seafood processing factory. It's hard to fathom. Then we go through the case study and they say it's fantastic:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In their current arrangements they must enforce 4 awards to run their business, the Seafood Processing Award, the Retail Award, the Fast Food Award and the Restaurant Award. This has led to increased compliance costs for business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But once they go through the single-interest stream of bargaining they're going to have one enterprise agreement. Seriously? How do you sit down and negotiate a meaningful enterprise agreement to cover a retail-facing fish and chip shop and a seafood processing plant? And this is the example we're given in the regulatory impact statement. It's absolutely embarrassing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, we look at that example, and then we go back to the bill and look at the general comment around the nature of the enterprise. One is left with the unavoidable conclusion that this clause is just so vague and so general that it could be found to apply to anyone and anything, as long as they're in some sort of geographical proximity. I don't want to criticise the people who drafted the regulatory impact statement. I'm sure they've done their best under very difficult circumstances. This is the sort of example they're giving us: a seafood processing plant—a factory, to put it another way—entering into an enterprise agreement which would cover retail workers in a fish and chip shop. Seriously? I've never heard such a thing. I'd love to know if there is any example of that being done anywhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a good reason why there are different awards that apply to restaurants, retail, fast food and seafood processing plants. The reason why you have different awards is the context, the facts and circumstances with respect to the place of work, occupational health and safety standards, presumably rosters and all sorts of issues are so materially different between those businesses. It is impossible to fathom how those sorts of medium and small businesses would come together and negotiate a meaningful enterprise agreement, but this is the case study that the government holds up. It is clear to me that insufficient work and time have been put into the preparation of this legislation, and I fear the consequences for our economy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="250026" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LAMBIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  To be honest, I've been consistent in wanting the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022 to be debated next year. It's not a surprise. I've said I have issues with it—mostly around the multi-employer bargaining, because we just don't know how this will impact small and medium businesses. We haven't had time to complete our due diligence and consult, listen and understand the real-world impacts. It's all well here in Canberra to debate and make changes, but even with the changes, we don't know how it will actually work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How are we supposed to get across all of this? We've been getting amendment after amendment after amendment—we got some just a few hours ago. I'm not convinced anyone can really predict how the changes in this bill will impact productivity and result in pay rises. I tell you one thing, though: no-one is getting a pay rise before Christmas. Let's make sure that's quite clear. At the beginning of the week, this bill was still subject to further Senate inquiry because we're all trying to get across the details. This bill is 250 pages long. The bill was only introduced on 27 October 2022, and just a month later it's being rammed through the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, I get the Labor Party is dead keen to get wages moving after wage stagnation for close to a decade. Aussies know and understand and voted on reducing the wage gap, stopping wage theft and getting better wages. They didn't vote at the election to support single-interest multi-employer bargaining. It's a surprise. Just how it will bite in the real world is terribly unclear. Businesses are concerned it may lead to more strikes, but, of course, we don't know, and Labor can't guarantee that either. What is a single interest? Location, the rules of the industry or the type of work? The fact we still need to ask this question shows how rushed this process has been.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments agreed between Senator Pocock and Labor still don't solve the issue; they just further exemptions to who is caught. However, here we are at the eleventh hour. The deal was done, apparently, on Saturday night, and we still don't have the amendments. Where are the amendments? If you are a small business of 15 to 20 employees, you're not caught. For businesses with fewer than 50 employees, the union has to justify why that business should be included in multi-employer bargaining—I'm not feeling comfortable—provided you are reasonably comparable. I mean, seriously. What does that mean? What does 'comparable' mean? No wonder your amendments are taking so long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These last-minute changes haven't allowed any of us the time needed to raise awareness with business and work out how this amended bill will impact them. It is unclear how it will address the wage crisis and even how quickly pay rises—if they happen—will reach the pockets of hardworking Aussies. The costs of living continue to increase. It seems everything gets more expensive every day. Since May 2022, there have been seven interest rate rises in a row. This means the average home loan of $500,000 has now gone up by $760 a month. You'll get a new interest rate just before Christmas. That's what you can expect. It's all well and good for Mr Lowe, the RBA Governor, to apologise to Aussie homeowners after he said interest rates were unlikely to rise before 2024. God help all our children out there, who did the right thing, thinking they were investing in their first house, with maintaining and holding it if interest rates keep going up. I see a massive crisis coming on their. A fat lot of good that's going to do to help all those struggling with meeting their mortgage repayments. It's not just homeowners who are feeling it. Renters also are having to tighten their belts, because if you raise interest rates it means higher mortgages, and common sense says it means higher rents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To add to that, Mr Lowe then said that higher wages will mean higher inflation. That means higher gas, petrol and food prices. The high gas prices are a result of bad Liberal government policy and its absolute failure to give Australians fair access to a product they already own. There's no way that Australians should be paying the sky-high gas prices we are, and it's all because the Liberal government and Labor failed to protect the Australian market, letting greedy companies export most of our gas so they could fill their pockets with huge profits and then profit even more by making Australians pay inflated spot-market prices for their own gas. I tell you, this country is in a world of hurt, and it's only just the beginning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if wages do rise, pay cheques won't increase until next year, and no-one can say by how much. Even after this bill passes, wages are unlikely to increase enough to cover all these hikes in the cost of living so that Aussies are really better off and are getting ahead. I support higher wages. Most people in Australia do. Why wouldn't they? But they have to be paid for by business, so they matter here as well. You can't help if your shop is shut and no-one is getting a wage at all. They're really worried about this bill as well, and so they should be. I want to get wages moving for nurses, aged-care workers and childcare workers. The government could have done that the day they got into power. That's what they should have been hitting. That's what they should have been doing. They could do it today, but they didn't and they won't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are being sneaky and dishonest. They said they needed this bill to do that, but they didn't. They held back the wages of low-paid workers, and they did it on purpose. They're doing a whole lot of things with this bill that they haven't properly explained to us, and that's why I've circulated amendments to take those parts out. The government can bring these parts of the bill back next year, once we have had time to consider the impacts properly. I'm not going to wear the responsibility of making mistakes with this one. The government of the day can do that. God help you if, this time next year, people are in absolute crisis, they're not getting their pay rises and there are union strikes all over the country, because I say this to you: that will leave you about a year and a half out from an election, and I don't see that cleaning up very quickly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't believe you've got this right. I believe there is a lot of union power in this. It's all about political donations, making sure they keep feeding the piggy bank of the union party—or, should I say, the Labor Party. That is where we're at. I look forward to standing here next year, holding this Senate back day after day and absolutely pummelling you people over there about the destruction that you have done to this country. That is where we are heading. By the way, we still have amendments we have not seen. There are still more to come. We are rushing through this. It's going to have a huge impact on this country. I can tell you now, the way we're all looking at it, most people out there that have some common sense know exactly where we're going. We're heading down the gurgler. You've got problems here. The first one is gas and energy prices. You've got home loans going through the roof, and our younger kids who thought they were doing the right thing are going to go under. That's where we're at. If you think an extra seven or eight bucks a week, if you get that far by next year, is going to assist, you are living in denial—you're living on another planet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The way that you have rushed this through just blows me away. I thought you were going to be a different government to the last one. Seriously, we're six months in and, I tell you, we're nearly back to the good old days of the last nine years. Good luck to you. I look forward to standing up here this time next year and watching you on the government side all sit there as you try to explain yourselves, because that is what is going to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, I look forward to the committee stage. I have quite a lot of questions because, once again, we had limited time to ask them before. I look forward to what the government of the day is going to say to the questions that never got answered because we didn't have enough time to get them answered. Four days and two hours for an inquiry—seriously! That's what we got on this bill. I cannot believe that you haven't learned from the past what happens when you rush through bills; we watched it for nine years. This is where we're sitting today, and you're following exactly the same example. Seriously! You've actually learned nothing. If you can't see the future of where this is all going—and anybody with common sense can see where we're going to be next year—then you seriously should not be the government.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022. This bill should be called the 'Fair work legislation amendment (union workplace takeover) bill', because that's exactly what this is. One of the most extreme elements of the bill gives unions the right to strike under expanded multi-employer bargaining streams, which constitutes an early Christmas present for union bosses and the broader union movement. This will inevitably lead to more strikes across the nation. Labor's so-called handbrake on industrial action is, in reality, like being hit by a piece of wet lettuce. The requirement that employers and unions must enter into compulsory conciliation before legal strikes can occur is a complete farce. I absolutely agree with Senator Lambie, who said in her contribution we are all fearful of what's going to happen in the next 12 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had many people, some of whom do not support our side of politics, say to me that this is the biggest own goal that Labor could ever deliver. This is a massive own goal. This is giving the union movement the ability to run the country. The only exemption from multi-employer bargaining is for businesses that employ fewer than 20 people. Apart from all the other costs, complexity and fears that businesses will have—some 56,000 businesses employ between 20 and 200 people—it will also stop businesses wanting to employ more than 20 people. If you're a business that employs 10 or 15 people, why on earth would you want to grow? Why on earth would you say, 'Okay, I want to put in another 10 people'?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a job destroyer, not a job creator. I will tell you how we know: we know because this dirty rotten plan was not revealed by the Labor Party before the election. If this was such a good policy—and senators opposite know this—Labor would have been championing this policy before the election. But, no, it was kept a secret. It was kept a secret for a very good reason: if Labor had gone out and spoken about the elements of this bill, Labor would not have got elected—not in a million years. Australians would never endorse these extreme IR changes; they simply wouldn't. They would not trust Labor giving this amount of power to the unions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, from when we asked for the modelling in estimates, there is not one scintilla of evidence to support the claim that this is good for jobs and good for wages. This is good for the unions' game plan. In reality, the union movement's biggest gift is the election of the most extreme left-wing Prime Minister in living memory, who doesn't have a ticker, who doesn't have the courage—unlike Paul Keating, unlike Bob Hawke, even unlike Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard—who doesn't have what it takes to stand up to the union movement to get the balance right in the best interests of all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I condemn this bill in the strongest possible terms. I condemn the fact that this has been rushed through without giving the opposition and the crossbench an appropriate amount of time to scrutinise this bill. I condemn the fact that the very rudimentary committee process has not given Australians a proper opportunity to make submissions in relation to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share the response of the Geelong Manufacturing Council. We know that nearly every major employer group across this country has condemned this bill, even the Geelong Manufacturing Council, which was pleading with manufacturers to be exempt from the bill. This is the first time I have ever seen the Geelong Manufacturing Council make a very strong statement like this about a government getting a policy wrong. When we were elected in 2013, Geelong was on its knees. We worked so closely with the council and with Geelong manufacturers after Ford decided to shut down on Labor's watch, when Alcoa was on its knees. Successive coalition governments worked to get Geelong to where it is now. It is an extraordinary development, that the Geelong Manufacturing Council is calling on the Senate not to pass this bill. In fact, in a letter to crossbench senators, the Geelong Manufacturing Council said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Provisions … undermine the system of enterprise bargaining and the comprehensive system of modern awards that have served manufacturing and employees well for decades;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Provisions … risk unfairly subjecting broad sectors to centralised settings of terms and conditions, reducing individual enterprise-level autonomy and competitiveness; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The criteria for access to the 'single interest' bargaining and supported bargaining frameworks may be used to achieve industry sector agreements in a wider range of sectors than purportedly intended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is ringing the alarm bells. I say, 'Shame on the member for Corangamite,' and 'Shame on the member for Corio, the Deputy Prime Minister.' In their own backyard, they have failed to listen to the likes of the Geelong Manufacturing Council and to consider the threat that this poses not just to manufacturers in our region, where my office is based, but for manufacturers around the country. So I say, 'Shame on Labor.' This is a disgrace, along with the decision to abolish the ABCC and the Registered Organisations Commission. It is appalling that the likes of John Setka are celebrating the abolition of the ABCC, saying, 'We're now back in town,' and, 'We can now move into non-union workplaces.' This is the biggest gift for the union movement and the extreme elements of the union movement, but it shows how weak and how pathetic this Labor government is. It shows how weak this Prime Minister is. It shows how weak this Deputy Prime Minister is—he couldn't even stand up for manufacturers in Geelong. This bill is appalling. It's going to set our country backwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the very limited time that we have left, I can only urge Senator Pocock: please have a dramatic change of heart. Allow this bill to be properly considered. Do not pass this bill this week without much further work. I absolutely condemn this bill in the strongest terms possible.</span>

I want to start by commending the work of Adam Bandt in the other place and my Senate colleague Barbara Pocock in securing important improvements and amendments to this legislation. The Greens are committed to getting workers a fair deal at a time when wages are flatlining and the cost of living is spinning out of control. Poverty, ultimately, is a political choice. Whether we are talking about the industrial relations setting in this country that privileges profits over wages or the welfare payments that keep millions below the poverty line, we received a clear mandate for action on this and other measures in the election, and this bill, well, it is a start.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SHOEBRIDGE:</span>
                    </a>  You can hear the coalition carrying on over there because their decade of delivering for the bosses is finally a decade in the past. I was lucky enough to watch the film <span style="font-style:italic;">Lethal Bias</span> in August in this parliament, and credit to the CFMMEU for bringing that to parliament and for telling the truth about the ABCC. It's a powerful film, and I would recommend it to those who haven't seen it. I commend it to the coalition. It shows the real safety risks, the lethal safety risks, that construction workers face just going to work. And it shows the aggressive anti-union bias of the ABCC in shutting down the unions, prosecuting union officials and union members because they had the wrong sticker on their hard hat or they fly a flag on the crane. Well it is about time we abolished the ABCC. It was nothing more than an attempt to weaken unions, to attack the construction unions, regardless of safety, by the now very former Abbott government. Its removal, like the removal of that Prime Minister and the removal of the coalition government, is well overdue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also strongly support the multi-employer bargaining as an important way of delivering improved wages and conditions, especially for those precarious low-paid workers in industries like retail, hospitality and child care. I want to express my high regard for the work of RAFFWU, who have been excellent advocates in this space, as they have been excellent advocates for their members and who are part of why we are seeing this political change and this legal change in the law. It's critically important to ensure that no low-paid workers—no workers—will go backwards with the passage of this bill. We know already millions of workers are doing it tough, and a serious rebalancing is needed solely in favour of those workers across the country who need a fair wage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was always the Greens' goal as we reviewed this bill and sought amendments to it in the other place and here to ensure that no worker was worse off. That's why I particularly want to commend the work of my colleagues in ensuring that there are secured guarantees that parents will have for an enforceable right to request unpaid parental leave. I credit Senator Pocock for that work and I also credit the work of Adam Bandt and the team that protected the existing better off overall test, the BOOT test, and especially its coverage for prospective workers. The legislation, as originally drafted, would have removed prospective workers from those protections contained in the BOOT—the better off overall test. That almost inevitably would have seen those workers having lower wages and worse conditions than even applied under a modern award—a real danger in the original drafting of the bill. Thank goodness for the negotiations, the work and the amendments of the Greens to remove those provisions from the bill and protect the BOOT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear, this will be an important win for workers, especially low-paid workers. It's a good check on the work that we are doing in this place, to do our own BOOT test on the legislation, and this legislation well and truly satisfies that test. Workers will now have an enforceable right to unpaid parental leave. There will be better work-life balance. There will be able to be multi-employer bargaining to lift wages, especially in sectors like retail, hospitality and child care. That is a really good start but there is so much more to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To those out there who are doing it tough, working full-time and still struggling to afford rent and bills, we hear you. We are working to get laws for workers, not the just those designed to deliver corporate profits or the increased returns for billionaire shareholders. I have to tell you, there is a long list of work still to be done with this, whether it is sick leave for casuals or a move away entirely from casual and insecure work towards solid wages and conditions for all workers and moving towards a four-day working week, where we finally get the balance right between work, our families and our social lives. But for now we're going to stare down the rhetoric, the attacks and the inflated, angry response from the coalition and their few billionaire mates who are opposing this legislation and we're going to legislate this bill. We are going to take that first serious step towards making work fairer in this country. </span>

We have been saying since the very start that we're happy with the majority of the bill—even more than that, we're happy with 85 per cent. We are happy to support the changes around low-paid workers in feminised industries and low-paid workers more broadly. I am on board with this. I've worked in low-paid jobs myself. I've got family members who are in the paddocks and the factories. They're doing low-paid jobs right now. My partner works in aged care so, believe me, I know how hard it is to make ends meet.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am here in this place because I want to make good laws that support people who are struggling, but I don't think this is a good law—not all of it anyway. This is good law bundled with bad law. It could be made better but it won't be. It promises things it will never deliver. I wish the government was right when it says that this is all that's standing between low-paid workers and a pay rise before Christmas. I don't believe that at all. That's less than a month away. We all know that won't happen. I'm sorry the government has made this false promise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What also makes me upset is that the changes this bill is making go far beyond what the government said it will do. The government has pushed these major changes through in a really sloppy way. The government has been a little tricky. There are changes in this bill that they didn't tell us they'd be making; changes they didn't tell the voters about during the election campaign. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will change how employees work with their employers on reaching an agreement about pay and other entitlements. It will change how businesses work with each other to bargain with their employees. It will change who regulates the building and construction industry and registered organisations. It will change how and when strikes can take place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People have raised concerns with us about some of these changes. We were told that the wishes of small businesses and their employees could be vetoed by unions even if those employees aren't part of the unions. We were told that some employees would be worse off with the changes to flexible work arrangements. Those employees are on a good wicket at the moment. They don't want these changes but they would have to go along with it. We were told that an employer would be included in a bargaining process even if they didn't want to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These things don't seem fair to me. I don't understand why one side should have it better than the other. We shouldn't be favouring unions over business. We shouldn't be favouring business over unions. I think there should be equality between both sides in a workplace bargain and this bill doesn't do this. That's why we wanted the government to split this bill. We were happy to pass the 85 per cent, but there's a whole bunch of changes that will be coming with this bill that we wanted more time to look at. We wanted to look more closely at the concerns that were raised with us, concerns like those I just mentioned. Maybe we need all of these changes. The government certainly thinks we do. They think if we don't support it we aren't in favour of getting wages moving. Well, I don't agree with that. I'm in favour of higher wages, of better awards. I would be happy if the government used its power to make those kinds of changes as soon as possible. But I can't stand here with my hand on my heart and say that I agree with all the changes this bill makes. I can't honestly tell you that you would be better off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parts of this bill that don't work can be fixed but that takes time and it's what we have been denied throughout this whole process. We need time to get this right. I don't want to get something like this wrong. It's not just me. The negotiations on this bill have been hard. The minister will be the first one to tell you that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a bit about the process now because that's important too. The bill is 250 goddamn pages long and we have had just a month to consider it. A couple of weeks after the bill was introduced, the government put up 150 amendments in the other place—150 of them! That came to 34 pages. This means the government has asked us to consider almost 300 pages of changes to the industrial relations system in the last month. These aren't little changes. They are fundamental changes, and that's not the end of it. There will be more. The government will be putting up a bunch of other amendments that will get Senator Pocock over the line. I haven't seen those amendments yet. How am I supposed to satisfy myself that my vote is in the best interests of the people of Tassie—employees and employers? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sorry to say it, but this whole process has been a bit of a mess. Why didn't the government just try to get this right the first time? If the government took the time to draft this legislation well, if it gave us time to consider these changes in detail, maybe I wouldn't be standing here saying I'm going to be abstaining. I cannot, in good conscience, endorse a bill that has been amended in terms I haven't seen—that I haven't been given the chance to see. I don't want to block this bill, but I wish we had a government that would work with us to find a path to back it—all of it, not just 85 per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government had worked with us slowly and carefully, maybe they wouldn't have needed to introduce 150 amendments in the House, and more in the Senate. There are no winners here, but I hope the people back home know that I'm trying to do my best by all of them. It hasn't been easy. My hope is that these concerns that have been raised with us have been addressed through the amendments in the other place and through the amendments Senator Pocock has secured. I guess we will just have to wait and see. </span>

I can hardly say the words 'secure jobs and better pay', because the bill will do neither. Senator Tyrell, bravo to you. That was a great articulation of everything that is wrong with this bill and the utter disgrace it is. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of my colleagues have gone through the many ways that this is destructive and duplicitous and spoken about the lack of transparency and consultation for the largest change to our IR system in over 30 years. The government is introducing, as we have heard, 250 pages of legislation that this place has had less than a month to review. There are 150 amendments, plus all of these nurses' ball amendments from Senator Pocock. With the greatest degree of hubris I have heard in this chamber in eight years, he is suddenly riding in on a big white horse to save us all from having to do the job that we do very well: scrutinising important, significant legislation for this nation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I couldn't help thinking last night, while listening to Senator Pocock's extraordinary contribution to this debate, where he referred to himself over 100 times—I have never heard anybody talk about themselves so much in a speech—but it was like he was coming in, this great activist, to save Australian workers, as if he is the only person in this place who wants people to have jobs and to have good conditions and wages as high as can be afforded. Colleagues, let me tell you: Senator Pocock is not riding into Australia on a big white horse to help us all single-handedly; he is riding the trade union Trojan horse into workplaces right across this nation. It is a disgrace. </span>

Unfortunately, there has been no opportunity for Western Australian businesses, large and small, to actively engage and comprehensively provide submissions and input into this process, because, again, in this place those opposite, with the support of Senator Pocock, have denied the normal processes. I say shame on all of you because we know what is going to happen. It will not result in an increase in real wages for Australian workers. It will increase exponentially the activism and the reach of trade union movements, which, of course, is what this was all about. Senator Polley gave away the game last night. When one of my colleagues was commenting that this hadn't been consulted on, Senator Polley interjected by saying: 'Of course, we're the Labor Party. What else did you expect we were going to do?' I think that says it all about the ethics and the behaviour of those opposite on this bill.</span>

We need time to go through the legislation for the committee to do further scrutiny for all Australians to have the opportunity to engage, if they want to, and for this place to do what it does best on behalf of all Australians. That is, scrutinising legislation and amendments in a careful, deliberate way on a bill that will be the most consequential on Australian workers in the last 30 years.'</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  I wasn't intending to give a contribution to this important debate, but I received a letter today which made me think I should actually make sure that these views are put on record. I won't be taking up too much of the chamber's time, for I know it is short. It was a letter all Tasmanian senators received today from the Launceston Chamber of Commerce, and I think it is important to put this on record given the contents of the letter. I will read it out as I think it is important, and I am glad I have a couple of Tasmanian colleagues here to hear me do so. I'm sure they've received the letter, but let's give it voice in this debate, because they have been excluded from consultation on this important piece of legislation which will change the IR landscape in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The letter received today at around lunchtime reads as follows: 'Dear Senator, The Launceston Chamber of Commerce is seriously concerned with the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022 (the bill) and the effect that it will have on business in Launceston and Northern Tasmania, particularly on our small and medium enterprises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In July this year, businesses were faced with increasing wage costs, increased super guarantee contributions and now surging electricity prices. Many businesses are still recovering from the dramatic effect of COVID-19, and currently there are very few industries that aren't facing the demands of doing business with staff shortages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the cost of living increasing, it's expected that discretionary spending will drop and, as a consequence, many of our small and medium businesses will see a drop in revenue. The last thing businesses need is rushed new rules and more red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span>, the regulatory impact statement prepared by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations showed that small businesses can expect the bargaining process to cost them, on average, $14,638; medium businesses, $75,148; and large businesses, $94,311. These are costs that businesses may not be able to afford and may seriously jeopardise the future of businesses, particularly small and medium businesses in northern Tasmania.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the above concerns, we're equally concerned with (1) the pace at which the bill has progressed through the parliament and (2) while we appreciate that amendments to the bill will see businesses with 15 staff or less excluded from the bill, it still means that small businesses with over 15 employees will be forced to adopt workplace arrangements and pay rates that they have had no role in negotiating. We also question the decision to use actual staffing numbers rather than FTEs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we appreciate that the Australian government wants to pass the bill this year, this is an incredibly busy time for most businesses, and we believe it should be held off until the new parliamentary term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Above all, we're seriously concerned that business organisations such as the Launceston Chamber of Commerce were not consulted at all or engaged with during the drafting of this legislation. The Launceston Chamber of Commerce does not support the bill and joins the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and other business chambers from around Australia in calling the Senate to split the bill to allow further time for careful examination of businesses' concerns. Failing this, we urge the Senate to oppose the bill.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The letter was sent from Kate Daley, the president, and Will Cassidy, the executive officer. I think it is important to put those concerns on record, because, as I said, the fact that an entity like that has not been consulted in the drafting of the legislation to me is extremely concerning. The LCCI is one of the peak bodies in Tasmania. I know that Senator Brown and Senator Urquhart, one very fine southern Tasmanian senator and one very fine northern Tasmanian senator there—</span>

                    </a>  Northwestern—I beg your pardon. You are quite right—not the parochialism of something that's rife in our state! But they would be equally concerned, without putting words in their mouths, about the lack of consultation that occurred on the drafting of this bill and the fact that we have legislation before this parliament when entities like that, who represent employer groups, have had no input, no consultation on the initial draft, on the proposed amendments. I note that we now have Senator Askew here as well, another fine northern Tasmanian senator who would share the concerns that the Launceston Chamber of Commerce have provided to us today and another recipient of this letter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we are talking about these extreme industrial relations laws we have to acknowledge the points that have been made by many in this debate so far—the devastating impact that some of these changes are going to have, particularly on small to medium business enterprises. We know—and I know you know, Acting Deputy President Henderson—that in small regional communities on the beautiful coast of New South Wales we don't have large employers; we don't have big multinationals occupying hundreds of square metres, employing hundreds of people. They're small to medium businesses. They're the ones who are going to be hit hardest by this. They're the ones who are going to find it hard to make ends meet, as the president and the EO of the Launceston Chamber of Commerce and Industry have said, with this confluence of increasing costs. </span>

                    </a>  It's a fine organisation, as Senator Bragg says. These increasing costs, surging electricity prices, increasing costs of maintaining property and assets and of meeting employee expenses all come together and put pressure on businesses like there is no tomorrow. In the end, if a business can't make ends meet, if they can't continue to trade, then what are they going to do? They don't operate in perpetuity. They don't just keep trading forever without facing financial pressure and ultimately closing their doors. What happens when a business closes its doors? Employees lose their jobs. I tell you what, if there's one thing worse than not getting a pay rise, it's not having a job—you don't get paid. This is the problem with this. I don't think the consequences have been properly enunciated here. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I was not intending to make a contribution on this bill; I think my colleagues have very fairly and well canvassed the concerns that have been raised by those in our community who will be impacted, both employees and employers. But there is this letter and the fact that this organisation, so central to northern Tasmania's economy, to small and medium enterprises, has not had a say. I wonder whether Senator Polley, for example, or any of the other Labor senators from Tasmania have reached out to the Launceston Chamber of Commerce. As proponents of the legislation—</span>

                    </a>  I know. I'm alert but not alarmed. My point, though, is that I wonder whether any of the Tasmanian Labor contingent have reached out to the Launceston Chamber of Commerce and whether they would accept my invitation today to come on down. I'll join Senator Askew when we get out of this place at the end of this week. I will drive to Launceston and I will meet you there and we can sit down with the board of this organisation—we can perhaps sit down with some of its members—and we can talk through some of their concerns.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be interesting to see whether they would be able to sit there and look into the eyes of these businesses that are facing these increased costs and tell them, 'Hey, don't worry. It's all a scare campaign. It will make no difference,' or whether they will hear these concerns and finally realise that these increased costs that are going to get even larger will have an impact on businesses, will have an impact on the capacity to employ and will have an impact on whether these jobs continue to exist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How can a small business cover the cost of $14,638, on average, to engage in the bargaining process? How can a medium business fork out well on the way to $80,000? Where is that in a business's operating capital in any given year? How is this fair to mum-and-dad businesses, where the people who own the business have mortgaged their homes to ensure that they can keep businesses running. They've taken a risk. They're employing others. How is this in any way fair on those businesses?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the opinion of the opposition and, I'm sure, of organisations like the Launceston Chamber of Commerce that these changes will result in more industrial action. These changes will result in more strikes. These changes will result in a situation where there will be a reduction in productivity. The changes will harm the economy more broadly and, again, are going to have an impact on whether people are able to keep their jobs or not. This is the end result. This is the issue we are talking about here. Everyone wants a pay rise and—do you know what?—it's good that people get pay rises. I know that my family, who have run small businesses up until very recently, always paid above award. That's good, because you have to do that to attract good employees. No-one wants to employ a bad employee. You want to treat good employees well so they stay, so you do what you can to keep them. But in this situation, where costs are going to become so burdensome on a business, even paying the wage bill is going to become impossible. As I said before, the end result will be that a business can no longer operate. It will no longer be solvent, perhaps. It will look at laying off staff to make ends meet. To that end, I share the concerns of the Launceston Chamber of Commerce. I do support the views that they've expressed, and I look forward to Senator Brown, Senator Urquhart, Senator Polley and Senator Bilyk coming on a drive with me to Launceston to catch up with the good folk of the Launceston Chamber of Commerce and justifying to them why they support this disastrous bill.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">G</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  This is an important opportunity for all of us to make some remarks on the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill, which is part of the Labor government's agenda for business, apparently, and for driving the economy. This is one of their major initiatives. I have often referred to this government as the government for vested interests. I will, perhaps, trademark the term at some stage. The reason I call it the government for vested interests—it will catch on, don't worry—is that, if you are a class action law firm or a big industry super fund or a union, you go to the top of the list. Your log of claims—the grievances you may have about your legal situation—are considered very carefully by this government. If you are a punter, a consumer, you've got no chance of getting your issues examined by this government, because these organisations, who are fellow travellers with the Labor Party—some of them are financial fellow travellers, some of them are perhaps social groupies—are dominating this government's agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not a terribly partisan person and I have sometimes agreed with the Labor Party over the years, but I'd have to say that the budget, which is supposed to be the centrepiece of any government's overall economic strategy, was extraordinary in its lack of focus on small business and on driving private investment and growth. That is because, when you are solely focused on working through a log of claims from various bloodsuckers and rent seekers, you miss the broader economic issues that the country faces. So what the budget did not have was a set of policies to drive enterprise and small business. Instead we see a hodgepodge of random pieces of legislation which have clogged up this parliament, which have all been written down at Trades Hall or Casselden Place—or wherever all the super funds people live—or down at the class action law firms. The manifestation of being the government for vested interests is legislation for vested interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">About 120 years ago there were these two countries called Australia and Argentina, and they were both similarly quite wealthy. Then Australia and Argentina went down very different tracks in the 20th century. In the main, Australia has been run generally quite well by people who were prepared to take a broader view and take the public interest into account when creating economic policies. Some of those policies have been bad, but I think they were genuinely created with the view of taking the public interest into account. Meanwhile, our friends in Argentina had their governments overrun by vested interests—small cabals of people and groups that put their narrow self-interest ahead of the national interest. They put themselves at the centre of the economic and policy settings of that country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now in a situation where a small group of organisations—unions and super funds and class action law firms—are basically being given the keys to the city. We have heard in this chamber many times over these past weeks discussion about Mr Stephen Jones, who's the Assistant Treasurer. So far, he'd be winning the gold in terms of the government for vested interests. He's the chief featherer of nests in the government for vested interests, but Mr Dreyfus is probably not too far behind, with his efforts on class action lawyers. Of course, the silver medallist here is Mr Burke, with this hodgepodge bill that we're considering here. It's all part of trying to deliver the same big plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I'm not a very partisan person but, being a parliamentarian, I do think about politics from time to time, and it's clear that the Labor Party's political strategy here is to pay off all these people and get them off our backs so we don't have to do any more of this crap in the next two years of our term. Their view is that this stuff is probably not too flash for the economy—I'm sure that's their real view—but they've just got to get these people off their backs. This is the pay-off: putting the unions back in the centre of the economy, stripping away transparency from super fund members and removing regulations to require class action law firms to act in the best interests of members. That's just a pay-off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, when we get to year 2, we might think about what the broader issues are that the economy is facing, and we might do a budget, which might mention small business, maybe, if we can discover what a small business is—one that hasn't been unionised and run into the ground. But, of course, when you hate small business, when it's in your DNA to do so, you tend to forget about it some days. Sometimes you can hate and forget about things; trust me. So we might see a budget that mentions small business. We might even see a budget which presents some policies designed to increase private investment, because that is actually going to be the measure of whether or not this economy is going to be able to create more jobs in the future. More jobs in the future: that is their stated objective, I'm sure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we hear about higher wages. Now, I have to say that, of all the strange things that people get away with in this building, perhaps the greatest of them all is the unions and the Labor Party talking about their concern about wages. If they were really worried about wages, they would've listened to Mr Kennedy's address to Senate estimates, in which he said that 80 per cent of the wage increases which are projected in the budget would be eaten up by increases in compulsory super. So here we are again—another scheme to enrich and refeather the nest. It's a pretty good nest. I'll tell you what: it's a pretty flash nest. It's warm. It would get you through a Canberra winter. It's a nice nest, but the nest is eating up the wage increases. They come into the chamber and talk about their concerns about the lack of wages growth. Well, 80 per cent of the wages growth is not going to the workers; it's going off to the bloodsuckers at the super funds, who charge high fees on it. It's going into a locked box that they can't get access to. But that is a blind spot for these people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has a series of blind spots, and, of course, in the budget we see this hilarious policy called the Housing Accord, which is basically that we will pay the super funds $350 million to buy people's houses—and to build people's houses perhaps. This is on top of the $150 billion that they receive each and every year in compulsory contributions, as measured by APRA. So we're going to give the super funds more public money to own the people's houses. But we're against the people using their own super to have their own houses. They are so blinded by the propaganda and the ideology that they've eaten and consumed for 30 years, which is now pushed and recirculated by the vested interests which make huge donations to their party. And, of course, they're filtered through the super funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This takes us back to our other favourite issue: the removal of transparency from the super funds. Mr Jones's first act as the Assistant Treasurer was to remove transparency from the super funds. As a result, by the end of this decade, $30 million will have been paid from the super funds into the unions. But Mr Jones has now made a regulation which covers that up. People are now getting their annual member statements from their super funds—I got one today—and it's now aggregated so you can't actually see how much money is going where. Under our regulation, you could see that, okay, I'm in super fund A and it has sent $3 million to this union and $5 million to this related party. Now you can't see any of that information, so it is a very good example of the distorted priorities of this government with regard to vested interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in relation to these matters, you'd have to say that the chief of the vested interests is probably the ACTU—although it could be the Cbus Super fund. They have a fellow called Mr Wayne Swan as their president, and he's also the president of the Labor party. He's been out in the media this week saying that the Cbus Super fund will be giving $500 million of their money to the Housing Accord. We have no idea how it will work, but I'm thinking that maybe he could have some inside information because he's got the dual hat thing happening. He's running the Labor Party and he's running the Cbus Super fund, so he must know how the scheme works before the rest of the market knows, which is another example of these vested interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, this bill is designed to smash small business. Labor hates small business. They always have. They've always hated the idea that no union officials are on these sites. This is designed to try and turn the clock back, not to try and create jobs. It's certainly not designed to create a higher wage environment. If they wanted to do that, they would have made the super system voluntary in some form. This is about ensuring that there is a role, relevance, and funding for their greatest cash cow, the unions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Labor Party talk about a donation reform and a campaign finance reform, I always think that's a great thing to hear about because, of course, they always want to try and capture the political parties but leave out the key campaigners, the people with the most money, who run campaigns in this country—the unions, the super funds, and all their other fellow travellers. Personally, I think we are going in the wrong direction on this particular issue. I've long favoured the idea of a very simple, very clean, small business award with basic conditions that protect people from exploitation and whatnot. But we are going in the wrong direction. We are going for full reregulation by putting these vested interests back at the centre of negotiations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would a small business that doesn't have any members of the unions, that doesn't want to have anything to do with the union, have to negotiate with the union? It's absolutely insane. To think that 10 per cent of the workforce now is covered by unions, and we're trying to turn ourselves into a nimble, agile economy, competing with the rest of the world, trying to attract marginal capital and the best minds the world has to offer, and here we are trying to bung up the economy with all these additional obligations to bring the past back into the future. It is just absolutely insane. As I say, when your frame of reference is, 'Well, we don't put small business in our budget, and therefore we don't care about it. We historically haven't liked it.' It's probably not a great surprise that here we are saying, 'Okay, we're actually now going to bring the unions back into the small business world.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole idea of multi-employer bargaining, which is estimated to cost up to $23,000 for a small business, which is a significant sum for a small business—when you've only ever spent your whole life working for the Public Service, I guess you don't really have any sense of that—it would cost $130,000 for a medium business and even more for a large business. The principles apply. I've always thought the segmentation between large and small was quite weird. We want small businesses to become large businesses. There's nothing wrong with big businesses. Certainly multinational corporations that engage in base erosion and tax evasion should be brought to heel, but there is nothing wrong with big business. So the idea that we try and bung up the work for big business is the same logic you would apply to small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the caveats that have been negotiated here, I'm not sure how good they'll be. My starting principle would be: Why do you need to have a union with these businesses in the first place, given you already have extensive legal protections in the law? And the people that are saying they're worried about wages growth are the same people that are stealing the money through the compulsory super increases. They're taking 80 per cent of the wages increases. Every time I hear these people come in here or talk out there when they're doing their silly press conferences and talk about wages, it is absolute rubbish. This whole agenda and this government's focus is on the vested interests and making that great big cushy, feathered nest a goose or down pillow and making it as best as they can for themselves. They're only interested in their own narrow self-interest. Unless we're careful, we will be the next Argentina—a once-strong country run into the ground by dodgy and dirty vested interests.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:18</span>):  Unfortunately, I have to rise and speak on the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022. It's disappointing to have to do so, because all my life I've categorised the Labor Party as being the wreckers of the Australian workforce. I grew up listening to my father constantly telling me how the wharfies went on strike in World War II and wouldn't help our troops out and export our wool et cetera et cetera.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't really see this bill as being the final nail in the coffin for small industry and small business here in Australia—no, no, no. The Labor Party put the final nail in the coffin of small business a long time ago. I call this the grave digger's bill. Basically we're now chucking dirt on small business so that they'll be completely forgotten about and erased from history, six feet under, with this ridiculous idea that we can have multi-pattern bargaining.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is Labor for you. They have to mandate everything. They just have to. There is no individual in the Labor Party's psyche. No, it's just communism: 'We're going to own all the property, we're going to have one set of rules.' We see that constantly. Everything the Labor Party does is all about centralisation, command and control. We saw it with superannuation in the early 1990s, where they slowly but surely raised the superannuation level from two per cent to 12 per cent. If they get their way and get a second term—they're already talking about it—they'll lift it to 15 per cent. Why don't you just take 100 per cent of it now? This is the Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same with child care. They want to tell parents that if you want any childcare support you have to give it to the childcare centre, because that way they get to unionise parenthood. This is actually why they push child care so high; without child care, the union movement, which is down to about 10 per cent of the workforce, would be much, much smaller. The only union that is rising in this country is United Workers Union, because of the subsidies going into the childcare sector. It goes on and on and on. We see it with the renewable energy target. It started off at five per cent, then it went to 23 per cent, then it's going to go to 43 per cent, and then it's going to be net zero. It will go on and on and on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note just how much damage the Labor Party has done to industry and especially to small business. I want to reflect on the election last weekend. Of course Labor is gloating because they won. They won the election, that's right, but you know who lost: Victoria. Victoria didn't just lose out last weekend; they started to lose out 40 years ago when former Labor senator for Victoria John Button introduced the Button plan, which was the first step in the destruction of the manufacturing industry in Victoria. Victoria was once the jewel in the crown of the Liberal Party because of that strong manufacturing base that has had the guts ripped out of it. If they weren't forced to close down, they've gone offshore, because effectively we had this crazy neoliberal ideology that somehow we were going to compete against cheap Asian imports. It never happened. All that's done is destroy Victoria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Combine the Button plan in 1985 with the Dawkins plan in 1990, where everyone got to go to university and get a degree. Because of that ridiculous policy that was introduced, another crazy Hawke-Keating policy, we've now got the situation where we have all of these students and Marxist academics controlling Victoria. A couple of years later, we got compulsory superannuation, which gave us another army of financial engineers in Victoria. Most of the industry super funds are centred in Victoria. These guys have well over $1 trillion and there's over $3 trillion and climbing in super. It is effectively going to be bigger than our GDP. This wealth is centralised in the hands of unelected board members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about democracy. We are not living in a democratic society in this country. When you have got trillions of dollars of wealth and our infrastructure controlled by unelected superannuation boards, both private and industry—I'm not taking sides when it comes to superannuation; the whole lot of it is communism and Marxism and fascism rolled into one, if you ask me. The fact that we then walked away from TAFE—the hands-on people that actually built things in this country—destroyed our manufacturing sector and destroyed our small businesses. We have now got more people on the teat of the nation, relying on government handouts through universities, through ever-increasing superannuation policy—academics, you name it. It has made our country very, very unproductive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we move forward two generations. We had the introduction of the Fair Work Act. Of course, there is nothing fair about the Fair Work Act. Interestingly enough, the head of the Fair Work Commission was Iain Ross, who Paul Keating himself admitted was the architect of superannuation, along with himself and Bill Kelty. They must have been sitting back there in a room somewhere in the early nineties, thinking, 'How can we take over this country?' I have to hand it to the Labor Party, because when it comes to bringing in communism by stealth in this country, you guys have done a very, very good job of it. I can tell you that I've had over 30 years in finance and I've never seen freedom as a line item on the balance sheet; if you want to be free you have to be productive. Our freedom comes from affluence, which comes from productivity. We should never ever forget that. Indeed, Robert Menzies himself said that we should not go back to the old and selfish notions of laissez-faire. He also said that the rich and powerful should look after themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we were focusing on the so-called  ideology of the free market, the left over there, the unions, were actually ripping out ever-increasing amounts of superannuation from workers' pay packets. I fail to see how they think we can live in a country with a free market when the government is taking a percentage of workers' wages. They never even asked them; there was never a referendum about superannuation in this country. New Zealand had a referendum about compulsory superannuation and they voted against it 92 per cent to eight per cent. But no, we weren't asked about that in this country. The Labor Party just decided to jack it up, and they're pinching money. This is super, right? This is what they do with superannuation—I'll tell you what that little ad where they do this with their hands is symbolic of. What happens then is that the industry funds take their fees and then Labor comes along and picks up the fees behind their backs, just like that. That's the way that the Labor Party works. This is another bit of compliance on small business. You have to fill out your superannuation forms and you have all these rules. It's more compliance for small business and it takes a lot of time. I've worked in public practices before and it's very time-consuming just to pay that extra nine going on 10½ per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this bill is riddled with so much conflict, complexity and uncertainty. Industry is extremely concerned; they don't want to be dragged into multi-enterprise bargaining. It's based on this very vague notion of a 'common interest'. Well, I can tell you that that common interest is doublespeak for communism. I can just see this ending up in court. Can you just imagine going to the Fair Work Commission with the words 'common interest'? Fair Work is stacked with Labor appointees and they're actually going to punish small business at every opportunity they get. It's going to make it very difficult. And this will actually punish the workers of this country, because small business just won't want to employ anybody when they can be held to ransom by such vague terms as 'common interest'.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know about you, but all these vague notions do my head in. Coming from a background in mathematics I have to find out how all these warm and fuzzy terms that Labor use hide their communism, Marxism and all that sort of stuff—it's all very scary. But I can assure you that what this bill will do, apart from put people out of work, is increase the cost of living and, if it doesn't send businesses broke, it's going to send them offshore. It's certainly not going to attract other companies to come in and set up business here. Why would you, when you can be held to ransom by the Fair Work Act? It's a real concern, and it's not surprising because this is what Labor do. They aren't going to finish until there is no more private property left in this country and free thought is completely destroyed. 'No, no, we don't want private property in this country,' this is the way the Labor Party think: 'and we don't want businesses to be flexible, innovative and able to think for themselves. And we don't want the employee and the employer to build up a relationship between each other.' With enterprise bargaining you could trust the employer and the employee. We would actually let them negotiate the best terms and tailor those so that they suited them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I don't believe in any mandates; it's why I took a stand on vaccine mandates, because I think you've got to respect the individual. That is what this party should stand for—the dignity and worth of every individual. It's got to stand for the freedom of choice and the freedom of conscience. We've got to have flexibility and the ability to innovate. That sort of stuff is what creates enterprise and entrepreneurialship that will drive productivity in this country. With productivity comes affluence, and with affluence comes freedom and the ability not to have to rely on that—</span>

Last night, when I circulated an amendment to the NACC Bill before we moved to the Committee of the Whole, you cried wolf about not having adequate time to even consider it. You said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Well, Senator Lambie, I don't think people just dump amendments on people and then expect them to vote for them. We will not be supporting the amendment. I'm reading this amendment for the first time myself.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My amendment was one page and dealt with one issue. The government's amendments were circulated at 6.23 tonight. They're nine pages long. My question is simple: why are you not giving us adequate time to make informed decisions about how these changes will actually affect the people of Australia?</span>

I just want to remind the chamber and, in particular, the minister that the official records of parliamentary debates, which include questions in the Committee of the Whole stage, are a vital source of information when it comes to statutory interpretation. As Senator Lambie has rightly pointed out, at 6.23 pm the government's amendments to the most significant piece of industrial legislation that this place has seen for decades were circulated. One might say the government was treating the Senate with contempt, but that would be for some to say. There is significant uncertainty about how this legislation could be interpreted. Yes, we will be here till 11 pm, because there are so many questions that need to be asked and answered properly for the purposes of statutory interpretation going forward, and we will resume again tomorrow, and it is open-ended, but, due to the significant uncertainty about how this legislation could be interpreted—which, again, one may say, appears to be by deliberate design—it is important that we as a Senate, on behalf of every employer and employee in Australia, get clear and concise answers to provide guidance to those interpreting the government's legislative intent. In that regard, to be very clear on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record, I will quote from section 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901:</span>

But, as I said in response to Senator Lambie, the amendments all relate to matters that have been in the public arena since at least the weekend, after the government negotiated an outcome with Senator David Pocock. For the benefit of the chamber I'm happy to give a short explanation of what these amendments are.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government amendments in relation to bargaining include among the factors that the Fair Work Commission must take into account, in deciding which terms to include in a workplace determination, the significance to the employers and employees who will be covered by the workplace determination of any arrangements or benefits in a relevant enterprise agreement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They authorise the Fair Work Commission to have regard to 'reasonably foreseeable employees', make determinations on views about whether certain working arrangements are reasonably foreseeable and amend an agreement with retrospective effect, if necessary, to address a concern that the agreement does not pass the better off overall test as part of the new reconsideration process. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments provide that employers who employ fewer than 20 employees may not be added to a single-interest employer agreement or authorisation without their agreement. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They provide that for employers with 50 or more employees the onus is on the employer to establish that it is not a common interest employer or that its operations and business activities are not reasonably comparable with the other employers. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments also provide for two things in relation to flexible work: firstly, they allow a pregnant employee to request a flexible working arrangement; and, secondly, they clarify the types of orders the Fair Work Commission may make when an employer has not adequately responded to a request for a flexible working arrangement.</span>

Did you withhold circulation until the start of the committee stage of the debate? I would like the minister or his office—they're listening in—to provide us with an answer as to exactly what time the amendments were finalised. Do the government amendments reflect all the changes announced by Senator Pocock on Sunday 27 November 2022? I'm more than happy for Senator Pocock, should he wish, to answer this question, but I understand that the minister has circulated the amendments. When did Senator Pocock or his office first receive a copy of the draft amendments? Was Senator Pocock or his office asked to provide any feedback on the amendments? Did Senator Pocock or his office provide the feedback on the amendments? When did Senator Pocock or his office receive a final copy of the amendments? Prior to the amendments being circulated in the parliament, as Senator Lambie has stated, at 6.23 pm, did anybody outside the government see the amendments, including members of any union movement in Australia? And, of all the government amendments on sheet PV124, can the minister please identify which amendments were the result of the committee recommendations, which were the result of negotiations with the Australian Greens and which were the result of negotiations with Senator Pocock? I'm happy for you to go through them dot point by dot point, as you just have, and advise, in relation to the dot points you just read out from the supplementary explanatory memorandum, whether they were committee recommendations, Australian Greens recommendations or Senator Pocock's recommendations.</span>

I'm also advised that Senator Pocock and/or his office have been consulted about the drafting of these amendments and I'm also advised that no parties external to government, whether unions or employer groups, were consulted on the draft amendments.</span>

In fact, I think you were involved in the Senate inquiry, Senator Cash, so you'd be familiar with that. I understand that the amendment in relation to the statutory review was also a recommendation of the Senate inquiry. I don't think it's any secret that most of the amendments have resulted from negotiations with Senator David Pocock. And, again, I don't think it's any secret that amendments in relation to flexible work are a result of negotiations with the Greens.</span>

Can the minister therefore guarantee that the percentage of employees covered by an enterprise-level agreement will increase as a result of the bargaining changes?</span>

We know that that's fallen away under the system that the former government presided over, with the complete collapse of enterprise bargaining, and we think it is likely that the proportion of workplace arrangements governed by single-enterprise agreements would increase as a result of this legislation.</span>

That business would not be, as you would put it, 'roped into' or forced into multi-employer bargaining. In addition, under the legislation, as amended, there is what has been called a nine-month grace period after the expiry of an existing enterprise agreement. It is always open to an individual employer to reach an agreement with their employees. As I've already said, it's the government's preference that that occurs. But we also recognise that there are individual businesses and groups of employees that, for one reason or another—such as simplicity—may choose to go down the multi-employer bargaining path. I can think of many small businesses that wouldn't necessarily have the HR to conduct negotiations or would prefer to not have to do that with their own employees and may choose to effectively sign up to a multi-employer bargain that is generated through negotiation by a peak industry body with unions and workers. But, as I say, pretty much every business has the option of reaching an agreement with their own employees.</span>

That's because there are many clauses within the bill that provide a range of options for employers and employees to strike a bargain, whether that be at the enterprise level or across multiple employers or multiple enterprises. Just because there isn't a sentence to the effect that you're talking about, it doesn't preclude the range of options that individual enterprises have for reaching agreements with their workforce.</span>

Because we are a government that wants to make our workplace laws as simple as possible for employers, employees and unions, we have, helpfully, set out the answer to your question in the revised explanatory memorandum. It's on page 188, helpfully, under item 636A, being the item that you referred to. We've made it very easy for people to cross-reference against the item of legislation. I'm happy to read that into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">an employer is likely to have a history of effectively bargaining in relation to one or more enterprise agreements if one or more of those resulting enterprise agreements provided for terms and conditions that were more than a marginal improvement on those contained in the relevant award (i.e. they must do more than simply pass the BOOT). The requirement would operate so that only enterprise agreements that provide genuine benefits to both the employer/s and their relevant employees would be relevant to the FWC's decision to exercise its discretion not to make a single interest employer authorisation that would specify the employer and its relevant employees. This discretion would not need to be relied upon where the parties have agreed (in writing) to bargain for a single-enterprise agreement as these parties would be excluded under clause 249(1D)(b).</span>

As a former industrial relations minister and, I think, a former industrial relations practitioner as a lawyer, you would be well aware that the Fair Work Act, as it stands currently, and which you presided over, does not specify every detail that the Fair Work Commission would need to take into account. That, of course, would be a matter for the Fair Work Commission to determine, just as many matters under the existing legislation which you were the minister for left matters to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission.</span>

When I'm speaking tonight I'm not just speaking to the employers of Australia, I am speaking to the employers and the workers of Australia. Unlike your government, we recognise that there are two different groups involved in a workplace—that is, employers and workers. We think that both of them have interests which need to be met by our workplace relations legislation. But what I can say to the employers and workers of Australia, and the trade unions of Australia who also of course have an important role in our workplace relations system, is that we are leaving a number of matters in this legislation to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission, including the example that you've given, and that is nothing out of the ordinary for the industrial relations legislation of Australia or, in fact, for many other pieces of legislation considered and passed by this parliament.</span>

That is a matter that is left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission. Your government and, indeed, former governments that've made provision for the better off overall test have ultimately left that to be a decision of the Fair Work Commission. No previous government has ever said better off overall means five per cent better, 10 per cent better, two per cent better, not one per cent worse. It has been left to the discretion of the commission and that's what we're doing here. </span>

Part of the problem that we've seen, which the government is responding to, is that the bargaining system that we have inherited—as a new government—is so broken that it is either unworkable for employers and their workforce to reach a single enterprise bargain or for one reason or another, involving power imbalances and other factors, that just doesn't happen. It is always open to a single enterprise to reach agreement with their workforce. And, yes, both parties have to agree. That's what a bargain is. If you have an employer who is unreasonably refusing to bargain with their employees, then this legislation does provide other options. Similarly, if you have a group of employees who are unreasonably withholding their consent to bargain, then there are options for employers. That's the balanced system that we're putting in place.</span>

As I said, it provides that the Fair Work Commission may make a single-interest employer authorisation that does not specify particular employees if Fair Work is satisfied that—and we've gone through section (b)—the employers and the relevant employees have a history of effectively bargaining. Can the minister guarantee that businesses—again, I need this for statutory interpretation purposes—who can demonstrate a history of bargaining with employees at the enterprise level and who wish to continue to do so will not be roped into multi-employer bargaining because of a rigid and impractical application of a history-of-effectively-bargaining test by the Fair Work Commission, given your comments that: 'The government does not specify each detail the Fair Work Commission needs to take into account'?

You said that no government has ever set out a formula by which marginal improvement is measured. What is the metric or metrics you are going to use to measure improvement? What happens if someone enters into an agreement and there's only a marginal improvement but we actually don't know whether or not the employees are now better off because there's no metric other than the BOOT test against which we can actually test it? 'Marginal improvement', on that basis, means 'just slightly tipping over'.</span>

And, when it comes time to bargain again, where an employer can demonstrate, or is likely to have a history of, effective bargaining, then that's what these provisions would apply to. But, again, I feel very repetitive in saying that, just as the existing legislation does not give metrics as to what amounts to 'better off overall', because it respects the fact that the Fair Work Commission has some right to use its discretion to work out what 'better off overall' means, similarly, what we're doing here is leaving it to the commission to determine whether, in the circumstances of a particular agreement, looked at globally, there is more than a marginal improvement, and, as I say, that has to be more than simply 'exceed the better off overall test'.</span>

My question is: can the minister confirm what is meant by 'appropriate circumstances' and could you please provide some examples? If it may assist there, it commences at 1081, at the bottom of page 188: 'For the purposes of new paragraph 250(3)(b), an employer is likely to have a history of effectively bargaining et cetera'. My question is what are the 'appropriate circumstances'?</span>

Over recent months, the Select Committee on Work and Care has taken evidence from witnesses around Australia around the issues affecting their ability to put together their jobs with the care of others. An important issue has arisen repeatedly throughout these hearings—the right of workers to disconnect from work once they've worked their paid hours. Can the minister please clarify how the bill will address the issues of workers' ability to disconnect from work so that they can protect family time, give care to others and rest?</span>

The government considers that employees should be able to stop work when they have finished their paid hours. It's probably something that all of us could do a better job of, especially those of us in public life. It is appropriate that employees are protected from the intrusion of work into their private lives beyond their contracted hours. This is increasingly important as more women and carers form part of the Australian workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One way this issue can be dealt with is through the existing mechanism of enterprise agreements. A growing number of enterprise agreements are addressing this, including through clauses that enable employees to disconnect from digital technologies outside working hours, with employers not to contact employees outside working hours unless in exceptional circumstances or for wellbeing checks. For example, the recently negotiated Queensland state teachers enterprise agreement encourages employees to disconnect from digital technology and communications when their work is done and when they are on holidays except in exceptional circumstances. On the employer side, the education department in Queensland has committed to minimised digital communications with employees to ensure that they have an appropriate work-life balance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also appropriate that award based employees have the chance to switch off from work after hours. The bill adds both job security and gender equality to the modern awards objectives and adds two new expert panels on pay equity and the care and community sector. These important changes will strengthen and clarify the Fair Work Commission's capacity to consider award matters to do with the work-life collision, including such things as the right to disconnect. It is appropriate in our changing world that the Fair Work Commission is required to consider gender equality and job security as essential parts of its role under the amended act.</span>

That's a comfort, certainly, to know that these matters can be dealt with in awards as the changing technologies of work affect so many workers with caring responsibilities. My second question: we've similarly heard a great deal of evidence around Australia that many workers in industries like retail, hospitality and aged care need greater roster justice. They need predictable shifts, a say over shift changes and the chance to refuse extra hours or be paid appropriate penalty rates for working hours beyond contracted hours. How will this bill work to improve workers' rostering rights?</span>

This is an issue that's very important to me on a personal level as well, because I've met many workers in my career both here in the parliament and previously as a lawyer for workers and for unions who have really experienced this form of job insecurity, and it makes it really hard for people not only to pay their bills but also to enjoy their family life and have other commitments as well. So these are really important issues.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our workplace laws need to respond to the changing composition of our workforce, with more working carers at work and more women in all forms of employment. That's why we've introduced new objects in the act and in modern award objectives. The bill adds both job security and gender equality into the objects of the Fair Work Act, and the Fair Work Commission must take these into account when performing its functions or exercising powers. In addition, the objects of job security and gender equality are included in the modern awards objective. We will also strengthen the bargaining system so that employers and employees can negotiate mutually beneficial rostering arrangements and systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Security of working time and appropriate rostering are essential components of job security. Predictable working time and a say over rostering is very important to working carers, as your question suggests. And given that so many carers are women, this also makes it a gender equality question. The important changes made by the bill will strengthen and clarify the Fair Work Commission's capacity across all its functions, including in relation to modern awards, to address the work-life collision, including issues such as rostering, predictable shifts, employee agreement to and say over changes in rosters, and arrangements in relation to the minimum length of shifts and rates of pay for extra hours worked.</span>

I understand that's section 243. I have been inundated with questions from employers all over the country in relation to the common interest test. This is something they have asked me to address in detail so they can start to get a much better understanding of whether or not they could or could not be compelled to bargain when they do not wish to. So the first question I ask is this. The section 'common interests', which is used in various positions throughout part 21 of the act, lists three conditions for identifying a potential common interest: </span>

This is the one section of questions that they are asking for answers to. You have said in your legislation three conditions for identifying a potential common interest: geographical location, the regulatory regime, and the nature of the enterprise and the terms and conditions of employment in those enterprises. You have now said, 'These are simply examples,' which now begs the question, given that is actually written in the legislation: what other examples are we now talking about for employers across Australia who, as I said, are listening in tonight?</span>

Again I make the point that the government is approaching this from the interests of employers, employees and unions, not just one group in this debate or in a workplace. It arises from the new clause as to whether common interest bargaining can occur and what constitutes a common interest employer. Section 249(3) says that the requirements of this subsection—which opens up common interest bargaining—are met if:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) the employers have clearly identifiable common interests;</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then subsection (3C) says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the purposes of paragraph (3)(b), matters that may be relevant to determining whether the employers have a common interest include the following:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) geographical location;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) regulatory regime;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(c) the nature of the enterprises to which the agreement will relate, and the terms and conditions of employment in those enterprises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this is a matter that is up to the commission to exercise its discretion in determining whether employers have clearly identifiable common interests. Guidance is provided to the commission via subsection (3A) as to what may be relevant in determining whether employers have a common interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You will have followed the public debate about this, and I've seen various opposition senators, including yourself, Senator Cash, put up nonsensical examples which are designed to scare employers and employees about the operation of this legislation. People are suggesting that a small corner shop might be roped in, to use your language, to some sort of a common interest bargain with Woolworths. Complete nonsense. I find it impossible to believe that any commission exercising its discretion would decide that Woolworths or Coles or Aldi or any of the big chains have common interests to a corner store that might employ two people. Similarly, I've heard wild claims made by members of the opposition that a large cafe somewhere outside Melbourne might be roped into a the same bargain as a small cafe in Cairns. Again, it's a matter for the discretion of the commission, but I find it impossible to believe that those sorts of nonsensical, wild claims that have been made by members of the opposition, designed to scare people, would stand up on any fair reading of this subsection by the commission.</span>

You have now actually stated for the record that there are a whole lot of other common interests that may or may not be taken into consideration which the Fair Work Commission themselves may or may not dream up that employers in Australia are not aware of. We are now moving, Senator Watt, into very dangerous territory.</span>

We are in the multi-employer single-interest test. We're not in supported bargaining at this moment, so it is 21 or more. For the record, are you saying that you are formally ruling out whether a small shop of 21 or more—so we're right in—will not be compelled to bargain with a Woolworths-type store if they have the same geographical location or regulatory regime or nature of the enterprise. Are you ruling that in or out, because if you are ruling it in, we have a whole lot of other questions. If you are ruling it out, let's do it for the record now, and then we're going to work through the size of business that you are ruling out that will not be compelled to bargain with another business.</span>

This test is that employers must be reasonably comparable to be covered by the same proposed agreements. And, again, in the supplementary explanatory memorandum, which has been tabled, it explains some of the new amendments that are being proposed. What we have said at paragraph 71 is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Employers of very different size, scope and scale might, depending on all the circumstances, be found to have clearly identifiable common interests for the purpose of bargaining together. This amendment would ensure that the FWC must also be satisfied that the operations and business activities of an employer are reasonably comparable with the other employers. It may be open to the Fair Work Commission to conclude that despite two employers of a similar size, scope and scale operating in the same industry, they are not 'reasonably comparable' once the full extent of their business activities and operations are considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, no, Senator Cash, the example that you've provided would almost certainly not pass the tests that are being provided for, both by the original amendment that was contained in the draft bill and by this new amendment, which will also require businesses to be reasonably comparable. So I'm sorry to disappoint.</span>

He was asked:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">located in a shopping centre with a large supermarket would not be compelled to bargain together with that supermarket.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Burke came back though with, 'The example given is wrong,' as you have now stated—that's good, because we've got to rule it out formally for the reason for statutory interpretation, so that's going to give a lot of relief to people when we formally rule out this. He says: 'The first reason is in terms of common interest.' He talks about the common interest—not comparability, but the common interest. So let's put comparability aside. He then says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So, even if you got over the hurdle—and I don't know logically how you could get over the hurdle—on common interest, to claim that they're somehow reasonably comparable would just a beggar belief.</span>

What happens if we're at 50? Are we ruling in or are we ruling out in terms of this example? Where are you drawing the line? This is now of great use to employers around Australia, because they will be able to say to the Fair Work Commission, 'Minister Watt has ruled us formally out on behalf of the government.' So at 21 we're ruled out; that's good news for those with 21. At 25, 35 or 50, what are you formally ruling in and ruling out by way of numbers?</span>

I don't think that Senator Cash has accurately characterised what I've said. The bill is very clear, that employers who employ fewer than 20 employees may not be added to a single-interest employer agreement or authorisation without their agreement. If there are 20 or more employees then there are additional tests that need to be met for an employer to be added to a single-interest employer agreement. In short, they have to have clearly identifiable common interests with other employers. As I said, the factors that the commission can take into account in determining whether employers have a common interest include—include—geographical location, regulatory regime, the nature of the enterprises to which the agreement will relate and the terms and conditions of employment in those enterprises. In addition to that, for a business that employs over 20 employees, they also have to be demonstrated to be reasonably comparable to the other businesses. That is what is actually provided for by this bill, rather than however Senator Cash might try to characterise it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to all that, and as Senator Cash would be aware, the government has reached agreement with Senator David Pocock that we are making an additional amendment which provides that for employers with 50 or more employees, the onus is on the employer to establish that it is not a common interest employer or that its operations and business activities are not reasonably comparable with the other employers. But for businesses employing fewer than 50, the onus is on employees to establish that.</span>

But I understand the amendment will go through, so I am giving you the benefit of that doubt before a vote has been cast, and saying 21. So it's 21 or above. You may define that as a medium-sized business; I still think it's a pretty small business. Let's talk in terms of numbers and start with a 21 headcount. How many employees does a business that sits within the single-interest stream require before it could be compelled to bargain with a large business? If you're saying you don't know, that's fine—you don't know. If you're saying that's left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission, I'm happy to accept that answer as well.</span>

As you know, should the amendment go through—and I'd be very happy to put it to a vote if you'd like to do so—what the bill will provide is that employers who employ fewer than 20 employees may not be added to a single-interest employer agreement or authorisation without their agreement. Once we get over that 20 number, then, again, it's a matter of whether the majority of the workforce wishes to be part of a single-interest employer agreement, and all of the usual factors that would need to be met to enter a single-interest employer agreement would have to be met. So there's no particular number; there are a range of other factors that are provided for for employers and employees who choose to go down this path.</span>

Thank you very much. When it comes to what you've stated in relation to coast to coast, I do now need to understand what you mean, as the minister in the government who put this legislation forward—because, again, the employers will have this in front of them and they'll be able to point to, 'Minister Watt on behalf of the government ruled out coast to coast.' I need to understand this now. There are a lot of companies in Australia who have raised this with me, not just in the mining and resources sector. I need to understand what the Albanese government means by you ruling out coast to coast.</span>

All of these matters are, as I say, matters for the Fair Work Commission to determine independently, but it is very hard to imagine that any commissioner would consider that a small retail outlet in Perth would have common interests and would be reasonably comparable to a larger retail outlet in, say, Brisbane on the other side of the country.</span>

A hardware store next door to the hairdresser. We're in the same geographic location. We're talking 21 and above, so we're in the single-interest stream. Can they be compelled to bargain together under the graphic location? Put aside the other elements. I'm talking here specifically about geographic location. </span>

The good news, or the bad news for employers across Australia, is that that's also a matter for the Fair Work Commission. So now I will move on to my next question. Can you explain what 'common interest' means in the single-interest stream?</span>

In terms of strikes, again—I know that Senator Cash spent months trying to run a campaign, along with her colleagues, that these laws will lead to nationwide strikes, they will lead to strikes in every business, every port, every train station, every shop, every childcare centre. I know that's what Senator Cash is saying. That's because the coalition are addicted to conflict in our workplace relations schemes. </span>

That is the way that the government is putting forward. It's a way that's based on agreements rather than conflict. It is not the intention of these reforms to allow for industry-wide strikes, despite what Senator Cash and her colleagues are saying. These are multi-enterprise agreements, not industry-wide agreements. Industrial action will be permitted for the single-interest stream and supported bargaining stream, but with safeguards in place. I don't know how many times I've told Senator Cash this in estimates, in the chamber, in the public debate and elsewhere. For her own reasons she chooses to ignore the facts and ignore what the government has repeatedly said, which is that in actual fact there will be stronger safeguards against industrial action being taken under this legislation that the government is putting forward than exist at the moment. I know that doesn't suit the opposition's narrative, which is that industrial mayhem will result from these laws, but as I say, we are choosing a different part path, one that's based on agreements rather than conflict. </span>

If it wasn't the intention of the legislation, one might ask: why did you open up an additional avenue of strike action? But you said it's not the intention of the legislation. The issue I now have is that there could be unintended consequences. In the event that, when this legislation is passed, we do see an increase in strike action, what will the government do?</span>

For instance, with the requirement for conciliation that is being proposed by this legislation, conciliation would be required before taking industrial action—and that's a good thing, to see if things can be sorted out between employers and their employees. It's what the commission should be doing. That new requirement being proposed by our government for conciliation before industrial action will reduce the likelihood of industrial action being taken. The requirement for 120 hours notice of industrial action will provide employers and employees, depending on who's taking the industrial action, with adequate time to put in place contingencies. The bill also contains enhanced dispute resolution powers for the Fair Work Commission to settle disputes during bargaining, which can help to avoid industrial action. Of course, there's also the provision that requires arbitration, or opens the door to arbitration, in the event of an intractable dispute.</span>

So I'm not going to speculate about hypothetical situations that may or may not arise situations under the government's legislation, other than to point out that this legislation is putting in place additional safeguards to limit industrial action in the absence of conciliation.</span>

She points to this folder of letters that she's received from employers, which suggests to me that she hasn't bothered going and speaking to any employees about what they want out of an industrial relations system. As I say, our government is taking a much more balanced approach, where we are listening to employers and we are listening to employees. We think that it's fair that, if a majority of workers in a particular workplace wish to be part of a multi-employer bargain and they can meet the various other tests that are set out in the legislation—that they have common interest with the other workplaces and that they are reasonably comparable to the other workplaces—then they should have a say on this as well.</span>

The employees I've spoken to are just worried that they won't have a job, so they're very happy for me to ask the questions on behalf of their employer, because they know their employer pays their wage. I'll go back to my line of questioning. Can you guarantee that a multi-employer agreement in the single-interest stream can't be used to capture employers in different states and territories? You've said that is a matter for the Fair Work Commission. I need to understand: when we say 'different states and territories', can you confirm that coast to coast is ruled out? I ask that because I do have some people listening in who have asked me specifically to get that guarantee from you again.</span>

Employers in different states and territories—Fair Work Commission. I accept that, but I need to understand: in relation to coast to coast, does that capture also the Fair Work Commission or have we formally ruled that out? The west coast to the east coast—if we've formally ruled that out, that's actually a good thing. I will give you that. That is actually a good thing. I just need that clarification.</span>

Yes. I presume you're asking in relation to what will be section 249(3), which talks about common interest? Yes. It says that authorisation must not be contrary to the public interest. Again, I think these are commonsense decisions for the Fair Work Commission to make. I don't think there's been any further definition provided of that. Of course, as would be the case with any other statute, the commission will take into account the objects of the act, but also I've been reminded that, on page 187, under section 107(4), the revised explanatory memorandum states:</span>

In particular, can you give us an indication about whether you see it as part of its role to respond to a recommendation like this, which was made by the Select Committee on Work and Care in its interim report, that is to develop an analysis of care work classifications and wage structures to systematically address underpayments and lift wages in the care sector? Such an analysis could consider the variability and value of work across the care sector and establish the interrelationships across different care types, recognising and revaluing the value of care work.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—Assistant Minister for Education, Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Deputy Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:25</span>):  That is an important object for us in this bill. Increased pay for those feminised industries has been a significant focus, and that will be something that we think will be addressed. We've obviously had a significant focus on early childhood education and care, and we think that this bill will help secure better pay for those workers in particular, so with a real focus on those feminised industries. There have been some examples that we have used to highlight why this legislation will be beneficial. We talked about Jane, who's been an early childhood educator for 40 years. She works at the East Brunswick Kindergarten and Childcare Centre. She is incredibly passionate about her job, as many are in the early education space, but it's been a tough industry for her to dedicate her life to. That's because of the constant struggles with staffing, and the low wages have been a significant factor in this sector for a long period of time now. Jane and her staff, along with workers in 70 other centres in Victoria, benefit from being part of a multi-employer agreement. They've won wages 15 to 18 per cent above the award. Just as importantly, they've won things like more time for planning and professional development. At the end of the day that's what delivers the better quality care for children that they are providing the care for. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the process that they have to go through to get there is currently drowning in red tape. It shouldn't be that hard. Directors in these centres are usually educators as well. They're not workplace professionals or HR professionals. We're removing the red tape so that people like Jane—and there would be thousands of Janes across the country—can do more of that essential work that they can do, but they can get the pay they deserve at the same time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that is important when you consider this legislation is that the early education sector is an area where we have a real skill shortage at the moment. Obviously attracting people to those professions is going to be easier if the pay is more adequate and deserving of the work they do. So we think that this bill will be a significant part of our ability to deliver, to ensure that those feminised industries are getting the appropriate pay. Also it will help us to attract people to go and work in the industries at the same time. It does have a significant impact both on pay but also on attracting people to work in that area where there are significant skills shortages.</span>

That's obviously really important and reassuring in terms of the skill crises that are across that care sector. As you say, there are many thousands of Janes. We've heard of many of them in the work of the Select Committee on Work and Care. Could you comment further, though, not just about the childcare classification structure, which is fairly truncated and doesn't really recognise the full gamut of skills that early childhood educators deploy, and how they relate to the similar skills in the disability sector and in the aged care sector? What we have is a plethora of job types that have never been properly revalued in relation to each other. We've got the aged care sector running ahead at a long overdue 15 per cent pay rise, but what would be the role, specifically of the panel, on care and community services? Would it be an appropriate role to consider the relativities across that really important and growing part of the economy and analyse what are appropriate relativities in the care economy broadly?</span>

We have set up two panels that will be responsible for looking at the specific areas that you mentioned. One is with regard to pay equity, and the other is with regard to the care and community sector. So I do note the work that that committee did, and I think that it was quite a decent effort to do that committee in the short time frame that you did. Not all Senate committees work as efficiently as that one, and that's a particularly good effort for someone who is relatively new to the Senate at the same time. We see that as being a significant part of what we do. Obviously we went to the election saying that we want people to get a wage increase. We know that people have been struggling, but it again comes back to that point I made before about attracting people to these industries. It is really tough while the wages are low.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spend a significant amount of my time in regional Australia and particularly regional Queensland, and I know how hard it is to attract people to work in some of these industries—whether it be aged care, whether it be providing services through the NDIS. There's not the market in a lot of these places that there is in the capital cities, so it's about attracting people to this workforce and ensuring they've got the training that they need to work in this area but also ensuring that they're getting paid adequately so that (1) we can attract people, so that they do see a career for themselves in this industry, but (2) once we do attract them, they become long-term employees. So it is something that we think is dealt with as part of this bill, and it's something that this government is absolutely passionate about delivering on, because (1) we want to see people paid better, but (2) we understand how important these community services are, whether it be in the NDIS, whether it be in aged care or whether it be in other parts of the care economy. We know how important those workers are to the community, and we think that they will greatly benefit from the parts of this bill that apply.</span>

I want to ask a couple of questions about the minimum wage. One of the new objects of the act is to improve gender equality, and one of the fastest ways to do that is to lift the minimum wage. I wonder whether the government has considered any innovations or changes in relation to the minimum wage, and I just foreshadow we are going move an amendment to the bill, mirroring a development in many other countries, which is to lift the minimum wage to reach 60 per cent of median earnings. It's a quick route to narrowing gender pay equity, and it links the minimum wage to the average shift in wages across the country so that it will narrow inequality more broadly. I'm just wondering: did the government consider the kinds of things we are seeing across Europe now, where they have adopted a European directive around lifting the minimum wage to 60 per cent of median earnings?</span>

It is an important issue you raise, and it is something that was also a discussion point at the Jobs and Skills Summit, where I think you might have been a participant at the same time. What we committed to doing at the Jobs and Skills Summit was a review into the living wage, and our commitment was to initiate a detailed consultation and research process on the concept of a living wage, reporting back in late 2023. That is something that we are still committed to. Obviously it is a significant issue, and I think that our commitment to gender equity that runs at the same time is important, and I think that, for the government, the fundamental premise of this bill is that it's designed to lift wages for Australian workers, particularly those who are our lowest paid workers.</span>

I think the Australian people know where we land on these things and I think that this legislation is an important commitment, but we also know and acknowledge that there is ongoing work, and it doesn't end with the hopeful passage of this legislation in the next day or so.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:35</span>):  Thanks for that answer. We'll of course be watching that process unfold with great interest. I wonder if you could also give me a response, Minister, to another issue that we plan to raise in amending this bill, and that's in relation to requesting flexibility. The UK industrial law has for some time had a right to request flexibility, beginning with just parents and families. You could request flexibility in the UK if you had family responsibilities, but they've reviewed the way that law was working and have now moved to expand the right to request flexibility so that it's available to all workers. You don't have to be looking after a child. You may have a friend you want to care for. You may have a range of other reasons that make you seek flexibility. I wonder whether the government had considered learning from or building on the lessons of other countries and widening eligibility. The great value of it, in particular for men, is that it removes the stigma of putting your hand up and asking for flexibility, and that has a lot of dividends on the home front, in terms of redistributing care and domestic work.</span>

Senator Pocock, we certainly support the intentions of what you're saying here, and I think you are proposing to move an amendment along these lines as well. As we've said, promoting gender equality is at the heart of our bill, and that's why gender equality will be included as an object of the Fair Work Act. Our bill also extends the right to request flexible work to pregnant employees, which does not exist under the current Fair Work Act. Our bill gives employees somewhere to go if their boss says no to their request. We do recognise, though, that it's important to balance the need for an employer to run their business with enhancing the rights for those employees who do rely on flexible work arrangements, and we feel that, at the current time, where we've landed on this point is the right place to land.</span>

Of course, we've talked a lot about that. I want to ask you about unpaid parental leave and the fact that, if the bill proceeds and the right enforcement is introduced in relation to requesting flexibility, the remaining national employment standard which won't have back-up will be the requesting of an extension of unpaid parental leave, and we will be moving an amendment in that direction also. I wonder if you want to foreshadow your response to that: is it time to make sure that all of the 11 national employment standards have back-up without leaving without a proper enforcement mechanism the one or two that are of particular relevance to women?</span>

The government will be supporting that amendment. As you say, it includes a procedure for dealing with disputes arising from a request to extend an unpaid parental leave period modelled on the dispute resolution procedure for requests for flexible working arrangements. As you would no doubt be aware, Senator Pocock, there are only two entitlements in the National Employment Standards that are currently unenforceable: the right to request a flexible working arrangement and the right to request an extension of unpaid parental leave—and these entitlements are predominantly used by women. Our bill was already providing dispute resolution for one of those entitlements, being flexible work. We support this amendment to also provide dispute resolution for the right to request unpaid parental leave as well.</span>

Senator Chisholm did confirm that. In fact, in the overview of the bill, in the explanatory memorandum, it states the bill would amend the Fair Work Act 2009 and related legislation to get wages moving, boost job security, tackle gender inequity and restore fairness and integrity to fair work institutions. </span>

It's in no one's interests to continue that. It seems that the coalition are the only group who think that that is a satisfactory way to go. I guess that's because they think that low wages are a deliberate design feature of their economy. But I can guarantee you that if we do nothing to change the system we will get the same result. That's why we are confident, again based on international evidence, that some of the changes that we're proposing here will deliver better wage outcomes and better productivity for employers. That's what underpins our commitment to making these changes.</span>

So I feel very confident pursuing these laws on the basis of that international evidence.</span>

There will be some agreements that are struck under this legislation that provide for higher pay rises than others. There will be some agreements that are struck that provide for a range of different conditions, some better than others. That's how the system works. But what I can tell you is that things like inserting job security and gender equality as objects of the Fair Work Act will provide for a fairer system of work and pay rises. Things like banning job ads that pay less than the minimum wage will help lift wages. Things like sunsetting the zombie agreements that we still see in place that arose under your government's Work Choices legislation will help get wages moving again. So there are any number of actions being taken through this legislation which will get wages moving again, and that's something that the Australian people voted for at the last election.</span>

It is interesting, though, that having spent weeks and months running around the country scaring employers and perhaps some employees about the risk of a wages breakout, we now have a series of questions from the opposition which seem to imply that workers won't receive a pay rise. So I guess the opposition at some point has got to make up its mind what the right scare campaign is. Is it going to be a continuation of scare campaigns that wages are going to be out of control, or are we going to pursue a different kind of scare campaign, which is that workers might not receive the wages that they think they might get? Perhaps some consistency from the opposition would be kind of helpful on this front.</span>

This is because it will be virtually impossible for multiple employers to come to a common position and then agree with multiple unions—that is to say, the more parties involved, the less likely they will agree—increasing the risk that the matter will be decided by compulsory arbitration. We've heard tonight there's a lot being decided by the commission: 'We'll leave to it the Fair Work Commission. That's a decision for the Fair Work Commission. The Fair Work Commission will make that decision.' If more and more agreements are decided by the commission via compulsory arbitration and fewer agreements are reached between the parties themselves, despite the fact that we actually began with quotes from the minister in relation to the primacy of enterprise-level agreements, will the government concede that the provisions are not operating as intended?</span>

As you would know, the way the legislation is drafted provides for arbitration as a last resort, so I don't think that it's reasonable to assume that the majority of negotiations are going to result in arbitration. As I said earlier in this debate and as Minister Burke has said repeatedly, we want to see a system where employers and employees reach agreement, and there are multiple streams being provided for that to occur. It's our intention to drive up the level of agreements, and let's not forget that, generally speaking, workers who are covered by enterprise agreements end up with better pay rises, better conditions and better pay in general than those on the award. So it'll be a good thing if we can see more agreements struck, because that means that more workers will get pay rises. They'll have money to put into the local economy—and you know what? Employers will get better productivity out of it as well.</span>

In proposing this bill, the government says the bill aims to secure jobs. My amendment on sheet 1768 goes to the heart of ensuring job security and protecting workers' rights. To ensure job security, my amendment on sheet 1768 ensures that unjustified vaccine discrimination is stamped out in employment. The original bill inserts breastfeeding, intersex status and gender identity as attributes that the Fair Work Act protects from discrimination. This amendment copies that approach and simply adds COVID-19 vaccination status as an attribute protected from discrimination. The protection is still subject to the limits imposed on the other discrimination grounds in the Fair Work Act. An employer will not be in breach of the antidiscrimination grounds where the employer can prove, as they should have to, that it is a genuine and reasonable requirement of the position. This amendment is reasonable in its approach. It is not radical, because it uses and simply extends the existing mechanisms in the Fair Work Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've long known that COVID vaccines do not stop transmission. Before this came apparent, however, getting vaccinated to 'protect others' was the justification many businesses used to roll out vaccine mandates. As a condition of keeping their job, many employees were coerced and still are being coerced into receiving COVID injections and boosters they do not want. The vaccine mandates cannot be justified, given the fact that vaccines do not guarantee protection from transmission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales Personal Injury Commission agrees with this view, with workers compensation being awarded for psychological distress stemming from mandates in the determination of Dawking and the Secretary of the Department of Education, handed down on 3 November. Sometimes the wheels of justice turn slowly, yet we are happy that judicial bodies are taking up this self-evident position that broad vaccine mandates cannot be justified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this, mandates are still in effect across much of the private sector. It's clear that further legislative action must be taken. Businesses are simply ignoring the evidence against unjustified vaccine mandates. A clear message needs to be sent that unreasonable directions that infringe on workers' rights have no place in Australian workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Often mandates do not even account for Australians that have accepted medical contra-indications to vaccination. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span>newspaper reports that Qantas sacked a pilot for failing to comply with a vaccination mandate while he was off work in a serious health condition: being treated for bowel cancer. Separately, I've met a Qantas employee who, after being injected with the first COVID injection, was rushed to hospital with severe disability—possibly life-threatening—due to the COVID injection. After hospital care and partial recovery, he returned to work, where Qantas insisted he get the second injection. He contested it and is on a vastly reduced pay on workers' compensation. He fears his career with Qantas is finished. How can this be in this country? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment seeks to reinforce workers' rights to refuse a workplace direction where it is not a reasonable and justified requirement of the job. It leaves no doubt for employees and employers that vaccine mandates must not be in place unless there is a reasonable and justifiable need for them. Minister, given that businesses continue to ignore workers' rights in this area, will the government support this amendment to reinforce the decisions of the Fair Work Commission and codify protections for workers against unreasonable workplace directions? </span>

As you suggested, maybe there will be a time later where we can answer your questions. Senator Cash, as I've said already, the requirements that would need to be met for different employers to be brought together under a multi-employer agreement through the single-interest bargaining stream, whether they be in the mining industry or any other industry, are that they have clearly identifiable common interests and that agreement must not be contrary to the public interest. We've already talked about the fact that there are different factors which may be relevant to the commission in determining whether the employers have a common interest. They include geographical location, the regulatory regime and the nature of the enterprises. So again, it is a matter for the commission to make a decision on any particular case. </span>

As I say, there is nothing unusual in industrial relations legislation about leaving matters for the commission to use its discretion. </span>

The scope of the work that has been excluded has been carefully defined to ensure that the exclusion is appropriately limited. Following government amendments in the Senate, general building and construction work will include work in the civil construction industry. As with general building and construction work, multi-employer agreements with not necessary or appropriate for the civil construction industry. </span>

You may not have heard me say at the outset, Senator Cash, that one of the amendments that we are moving, following the negotiations with Senator David Pocock, is that the asphalt industry is not considered to be general building and construction work. Also, there is an amendment which I didn't mention earlier, which is about work that is the construction, repair, maintenance or demolition of powerhouses or other structures that use eligible renewable energy sources to generate electricity. So businesses and employees in those two industries—renewables and asphalt—would be able to access multi-employer bargaining provided they met all the other relevant tests.</span>

One of the examples given is:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that work—in relation to installation, major modernisation, servicing, repair or maintenance of, I think you said, air conditioning or ventilation—is not considered to be general building and construction work and therefore could be the subject of multi-employer bargaining if the employers and employees chose to do so and if it passed the other tests.</span>

His members are very enthusiastic about taking part in multi-employer bargaining, and the reason he gave was that he and his members were sick of seeing rogue operators in the industry trying to undercut people through a race to the bottom for wages.

My understanding is, though, that the mining sector, particularly on the east coast, is also a significant user of single-enterprise agreements. Was the government approached in any way by any of the mining companies to also have an exclusion on the basis that they already have a higher proportion of enterprise agreements, consistent with the government's rationale for excluding certain parts of the building and construction industry?</span>

I don't think anyone set a metric for what percentage of agreements in a particular sector needed to be met in order for them to take part or not take part in multi-employer agreements, just as there was no metric that needed to be met to determine whether something is in the same geographical location. These are matters of judgement, and our judgement was that the practice in the construction industry was well set; it didn't need multi-employer bargaining. If mining companies want to continue their practice of single enterprise bargaining and their workforce agrees, then I expect they'll continue with it.</span>

To take one example, around the geographical location, it's hard to imagine that the commission exercising its discretion would include every single business in every single industry in the entire country. I think there are adequate safeguards in there for businesses who are concerned about that, and the bottom line is that any such bargain would need to be considered to be in the public interest by the commission.</span>

But to suggest that that will mean that every corner store in the country, of varying sizes, selling different products—pizza stores, retail stores, hamburger stores, whatever kinds of stores—are going to be part of the same multi-employer agreement, I think, is exaggerating, because it would ignore the various tests that are put in place in the legislation.</span>

The bill that we introduced, prior to the negotiations with Senator Pocock being finalised, already, to use your words, 'carved out' commercial construction work, and that was defined to be 'general building and construction work' in the original bill. That, of course, had the various exemptions to the exemptions that we were talking about before. What's changed as a result of the negotiations with Senator Pocock is that there's an additional form of what might be regarded as construction work, being work to do with renewable energy, that is also now exempted from the exemption. Just to clarify, as a result of the negotiations with Senator Pocock, the category of work that was excluded from multi-employer bargaining was expanded from being commercial construction work to civil and construction commercial work, and, through the course of those negotiations, it was agreed that construction work in relation to renewable energy would not be part of the exemption, and therefore could be subject to multi-employer bargaining.</span>

The bill that we are currently debating has some of the most fundamental changes to the industrial relations system that this parliament has seen in decades. You are opening up a new stream of multi-employer bargaining. In relation to the common interest test, the public interest test and the comparability test, you have advised the committee—it is on record for statutory interpretation purposes—that 'that will be left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission'. You have refused to rule out scenario after scenario after scenario: employers in different states and territories, employers across different industries, big businesses and small businesses, marginal businesses and profitable industries. I have asked you directly: does the bill limit the number of businesses that can be part of an agreement? The answer was no. So, when this bill passes, we will be talking about a fundamentally different state of affairs. And you are right: the impacts on competition have been raised time and time again in the incredibly short time that employers and employees across this country have had in relation to understanding the impact of this legislation. So, given that you admit that this issue has been raised—it hasn't been raised in relation to the current regime; it has been raised in relation to the fundamental changes that are now occurring—did the department consider competition effects of this bill? If not, why not?</span>

What it also considered was the longstanding exemption of industrial relations laws as they relate to terms and conditions of employment from competition laws. In fact, the former commissioner of the ACCC Rod Sims has only today made the public statements that workplace relations laws, particularly in relation to the terms and conditions of employment, have been exempt from competition laws since 1965 for good social policy reasons. Nothing has changed as a result of this legislation. </span>

Every provision in it was put to Treasury for their views, and they provided the feedback that they provided. What we're trying to get to in this country is a workplace relations system where we see competition among businesses on innovation, on the quality of their product or on the quality of the service that they offer to their customers, not competition based on undercutting each other's wages. That's what we're trying to achieve here. I'm trying to find the relevant section of the Competition and Consumer Act as well. The Competition and Consumer Act 2010 provides an exemption from the application of competition law in determining whether certain anti-competitive behaviour has occurred. The act actually says:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) to any act done, or concerted practice, to the extent that it relates to the remuneration, conditions of employment, hours of work or working conditions of employees …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any act undertaken in accordance with any law, such as this law, which relates to, for instance, the remuneration, condition of employment, hours of work or working condition of employees is exempt from competition law under the very act that sets out the competition law of Australia, so any attempts that are being made to wind up employers that they might be subject to action from the ACCC are completely wrong and yet another false, baseless scare campaign from the coalition.</span>

Again, we've had just today the former chair of the ACCC, Mr Sims, make the point that workplace relations laws and matters to do with the terms and conditions of employment are exempt from competition law, and it was there in black and white in section 51(2). Yes, the Treasury was consulted. ACCC falls within it. But it's pretty crystal clear in the law that there's nothing to be concerned about.</span>

They understand the regime as it currently stands. They are raising concerns in relation to the potential impact of multiemployer bargaining and the fact that competitors may well be compelled to bargain together. One of the purposes of the bill is to allow protected industrial action to occur across multiple employers at once. Can you just confirm that, where a single enterprise agreement expires and bargaining does not commence, that particular employer could be compelled to bargain under this act?</span>

Well, again, I know it suits the narrative to talk about businesses being compelled to be part of multi-employer bargains, but, as we've been talking about over the course of the night, a business might actually choose to be part of a multi-employer bargain. It does happen. There are businesses who want to do this. Mr Scavera, who I was referring to before, and his air-conditioning and ventilation businesses want to be part of this so that they can stop a race to the bottom on wages. But, even for those businesses who don't want to be part of it, first of all the majority of their workforce has to vote in favour of it and then they have to satisfy all of those common-interest and reasonably-comparable-business tests.</span>

But, for reasons of your own, you haven't done so, and you keep coming back asking the same questions and fuelling the scare campaigns that businesses, unfortunately, are on the other end of. I'd encourage you and your colleagues to actually pass on the facts that you have been repeatedly told rather than continuing to fuel scare campaigns on the basis of incorrect information that you've been repeatedly told is incorrect.</span>

In relation to the first point, as you say, the cooperative stream is available for businesses and employees who want to be part of a cooperative agreement, usually signing up to an agreement that other businesses would be part of as well. There is provision within the bill for businesses to withdraw from cooperative stream agreements if they have the agreement of the relevant union. Of course, if that isn't the case then, as is the case for many other agreements, that agreement that has been signed up to would expire at its expiry date.</span>

So more than anything, what would need to be demonstrated is that a particular employer has clearly identifiable common interests with the other employers and that it's not contrary to the public interest for them to be joined. Of course, in addition there's now a new reasonably comparable test as well. </span>

However, I'd remind you that there are a number of businesses who already make use of this system under your government's legislation. For instance, I believe that in various states and territories Catholic schools have already made use of this system. So that has obviously been a matter that the commission has already deemed to be similar in terms of the nature of the enterprises.</span>

So you might like to make something of the fact that items are being left to the discretion of the commission, but the system that you presided over gave you, as the minister, the discretion to make these decisions. I think most Australians would feel a lot more comfortable with the Fair Work Commission making those decisions rather than any minister of the day, whatever their political persuasion.</span>

I am merely asking for further guidance in relation to what is 'the nature of the enterprise'. Would any two retail stores be considered as having the same nature? I am asking for guidance here.

Businesses, employees and Australians have had little to no time to properly consider this legislation. That is the right of your government, despite the fact that you were allegedly elected on a basis of integrity and transparency. These are very genuine questions that we are asking in relation to a test that you have put into your bill. In part 21, relating to the single-interest stream, under the section headed 'Common interests'—which is used in various positions throughout the bill—the common interest test lists three conditions for identifying a potential common interest. One is geographical location, and I've accepted now that there is no guidance. I accept that. In every answer you have given—and we can go through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record tomorrow again—you've said it is left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission. I accept that as an answer. There are no hypotheticals here. These are genuine questions that employers and employees are asking.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in the common interest test set out in your bill is 'the nature of the enterprise'. If, when I ask, 'Would any two retail stores be considered as having the same nature?' you are saying to me, 'It's for the discretion of the Fair Work Commission; there is nothing more that I can add to the answer; there is nothing further in the bill that provides any guidance,' well, that's the answer. But you say, 'I won't answer a hypothetical.' How is it possibly a hypothetical when we're asking the question on behalf of retail stores in Australia?</span>

                    </a>  I will withdraw it, but what I will say is this is very, very disappointing. You are refusing to provide guidance about who could be compelled to bargain together. You are making changes to the system. You are standing here tonight in the committee stage of a bill. I said to you at the beginning—I read out to you—the tone in which I would ask the questions, and the importance of questions when it comes to statutory interpretation. To date, despite the farce of the committee process that was undertaken in relation to this bill, despite the alleged consultation that your government keeps saying it has undertaken with businesses across this country, there are hundreds of questions I would put to you, legitimate questions that employers would like answered, before this bill goes through. If you go to your own regulatory impact statement, you can't answer any of these questions. It's at the discretion of the Fair Work Commission. I'd rather you say that it's at the discretion of the Fair Work Commission, because at least then employers would have some idea. But, when you say it is hypothetical, quite frankly you are mocking businesses in Australia, who are the employers in this country. Your own regulatory impact statement says that, if you get into this bargaining process, if you're a small business, you could be $14½ thousand worse off. If you are a medium-sized business it was $75,000, until the $5,000 typo was found out. So they'll need to fork out around $80,000 to get their own advice. What is worse is: you are now saying that we are delving into hypotheticals. So tell me: would two businesses in the mining sector be considered as having the same nature?</span>

You talked about being disappointed. I know what is really disappointing for the coalition is that wages might get moving again. That's what really disappointing. That's why we see this filibustering, where, even after all this time, even after 10 years of suppressing wages, that's not enough for the coalition. Even after an election where Australians voted for wages to get moving again, that's not enough for the coalition. Even though we're nearly seven months after the election, that's still not enough for the coalition, because the truth is that, for the coalition, it's never the right time for Australian workers to get a pay rise. That's what's disappointing to the coalition. You can ask every hypothetical question you want. You can soak up every minute you want. You can soak up every hour you want. We know you wanted to defer this legislation to next year, and, if we'd gone along with that, you would have wanted to defer it to the year after that and the year after that, because you would rather have two decades of wage suppression than one decade. But we're not going to let that happen. We're determined to change Australia's workplace laws from the decrepit system that you presided over, which delivered 10 years of stagnant wages and low productivity for businesses. It didn't work for anyone. It engendered conflict rather than agreements. It has delivered low wages and low productivity. That is going to change. I'm surprised, frankly, that the coalition didn't hear the message from the Australian people at the election that they wanted something different. Well, we're going to deliver something different, and it's going to benefit not just workers but businesses around this country, and it's long overdue that that happened.</span>

You are in government. This is your legislation, and you are answering the questions—or failing to answer them, in this case. Political commentary does not aid in statutory interpretation. The situation we now find ourselves in is this: given you have given no guidance whatsoever—in fact, you have actually said they are mere hypotheticals, which anyone in Australia knows they are not; they are very genuine questions that are being asked—there is nothing stopping one Fair Work commissioner, because everything is being left 'to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission', considering a butcher and a newsagent to be related businesses with a common interest and another commissioner making a different conclusion.</span>

This is the final opportunity that the opposition, the crossbench and the Australian Greens have on behalf of their constituents, the people we represent, and in this case tonight for me it's employers who actually want to do the right thing by their employees. They are saying, 'Can you please get further guidance from the government, so that we have half an idea about what we do?' and the only thing that we have established tonight is, 'It is ultimately a matter for the discretion of the Fair Work Commission.'</span>

Ultimately that question comes down to whether the casuals are regular or not. The way the legislation is already drafted is that, essentially, regular casuals would be considered within the 20-employee cap, but irregular casuals—so, people who haven't worked there for a period of time or something like that—would not. That would apply whether we're talking about seasonal workers or other forms of casual employment.</span>

I'm just going to ask the officials to double-check whether there has ever been any case law on this point to determine whether seasonal workers are considered regular and systematic casuals. I talked about regular, but regular and systematic casuals would be considered employees for the purposes of that cap. I'm very much speculating here. That's really how it works.</span>

Again, I guess it would be a common sense test for the commissioner to apply to determine whether a particular business is reasonably comparable to another. I would expect that if they are in a completely different industry, or of completely different scale, it would be difficult to see how the commission could say that those two businesses are reasonably comparable. Again, that's a decision for the commission. </span>

I would think the commission would consider each of those businesses as separate, rather than rolling them together as a conglomeration. Again, it would depend on the terms and conditions of employment of the IGA employees. I actually don't know if they have the same terms and conditions whether they're the IGA in your suburb in Canberra or mine in Brisbane. But, if they are operating quite distinctly with different ownership and different terms and conditions, I would expect that the commission would consider them separate businesses rather than rolling them together as one big group.</span>

I will keep giving the same answer over and over again, so it's in everyone's interests that I refer back to those earlier answers. Again, I make the point that the overarching issue and requirement here is set out in the previous subsection, which is that employers have clearly identifiable common interests and that it's not contrary to the public interest to make the authorisation. That is what is actually required, and the remainder, which Senator Cash wants to go through in detail, are simply examples of what may amount to common interest, and every answer I give will be the same.</span>

I've approached them from the perspective of statutory interpretation and the ability for those who are seeking to interpret your legislation, in the very likely event proceedings are commenced, being able to refer to the answers that you have provided to the Australian Senate tonight. I really don't think 'My answers are going be the same for the rest of the questions' is going to help anybody in their efforts when it comes to statutory interpretation. So, can I just confirm then, in relation to the terms and conditions of employment in these enterprises, which is a part of the common interest test or something that can be taken into consideration, you are not going to provide the Senate with any further information in relation to what this means in the context of determining whether employers have a common interest? Can I just confirm that? Then I can move on to my next line of questioning.</span>

We were never in this position. You are the government that's bringing forward these changes. So, to be fair again to the employers and employees of this country, who would like to do the right thing by each other, they have to now do the right thing under your legislation, and you are unable to provide them with any further guidance. But I will confirm that, as you said, it will be left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission. That was in relation to the terms and conditions of employment.</span>

What we're talking about here is regulatory regimes in the sense of childcare regulatory regimes, education regulatory regimes or healthcare regulatory regimes. When those sorts of regulatory regimes apply, that is a matter that could be considered by the commission as demonstrating that particular employers have common interests. Again, this point about discretion is nothing new in Australian workplace law. Under the existing act that your government presided over and that you as minister presided over, Senator Cash, the commission, for example, had discretion on whether to terminate protected industrial action. Your government didn't spell out exactly what the test was, exactly what needed to be satisfied for the commission to determine whether to terminate protected action; it left it to the commission to decide that based on certain factors, which is exactly the approach we're taking here. The better-off-overall test, which has been within the Fair Work Act for some time, may have its detractors and may need improving, and that's what we're doing in this legislation, but no previous government, including yours, including when you were minister, ever spelt out categorically what 'better off overall' meant. That was left to the commission to decide. So, if any employers, employees or unions are listening and concerned by this approach, I imagine they would have had similar concerns about matters being left to the commission to decide in the past.</span>

You are saying that they can be compelled if they satisfy a common interest test, but to date the government has not been able to explain the common interest test. You cannot explain what a 'geographic similarity' is, you cannot explain what a 'similar nature' is, you cannot explain what the terms and conditions of employment in those enterprises are and you basically said it will be left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission.

They're just the ones that I've sat here and remembered myself over the last three minutes. I haven't even started looking through the act to find every other reference to it. It's a system that you applied. It's a common system. You applied it. It's being applied here now.

This matter is dealt with by one of the new amendments. I think clause 53 refers to that. It refers to schedule 1, item 637 on page 11 of the new amendments. Essentially, there are two ways for an employer to exit a single-interest bargain while it is in force. They both require application to the commission.</span>

The point about having a majority vote of employees, that's only required for businesses with 50 or fewer employees—it's fewer than 50. It's available as an option for businesses with fewer than 50 employees. It will end up being subsection 251(2A), which deals with the circumstances that allow the Fair Work Commission to vary an authorisation.</span>

It provides an avenue for a business or an employer to exit the single-interest stream. For example, in the event that the one-size-fits-all agreement that they now have to work under actually means the employer's business becomes unviable, resulting in probable business destruction and associated job loss, there is a mechanism in the bill for them to exit the single-interest stream. They make an application to the commission. They either have a majority vote of the employees, or they must prove they have had a change in circumstances. How will they prove a change in circumstances? What does this mean?</span>

These are very deliberate questions that are being asked. Employers have been unable to work this out. They've just seen the amendment. Could you take me through what is a change in circumstances? They've been compelled into a multi-employer agreement. The multi-employer agreement has resulted in their business now becoming unviable. They wish to exit. They can apply to the commission with a majority vote or they can prove they have had a change in circumstances. Can you take us through how they will prove this?</span>

It is exactly the same test. Having been, like you, an industrial lawyer—although I suspect probably on different sides of matters—I have certainly had a lot of experience of unions and employees being willing to renegotiate terms and conditions of their employment when faced with serious viability concerns, so I have every confidence that, just as unions and employees have been able to approach these issues maturely with employers in the past, they will continue to do so under the new system as well. </span>

The problem with that is, though, that is not the small business or medium business or large business tonight seeking guidance from this part of the debate being merely referred to a particular section of the act, because they don't have the time to now go and find a copy of the Fair Work Act, flip through to 'change in circumstances' and work out what it means. So with all due respect, I would like an answer to: If an employer must prove they've had a change in circumstances, how will they prove it? </span>

Remember, single-interest bargaining, multi-employer bargaining have been available under the legislation that exists now, that you presided over as the minister. Section 251 of the current act spells out how an employer can seek to vary a single-interest employer authorisation by removing the employer's name.

And I'm glad you reminded me of the cost issues, Senator Cash, because that's of course been one of the other scare campaigns you've been out there running, and you did it again tonight—about the thousands of dollars that small businesses were going to have to pay to be part of multi-employer bargaining. Wrong! The whole point of multi-employer bargaining is that it gives various employer groups, chambers of commerce and other associations the opportunity to design agreements that would work across a range of different employers. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would hazard a guess that most small businesses or medium-size businesses that want to take part in multi-employer bargaining would choose to take advantage of an agreement that has already been designed for them by an employer group, rather than deciding to go and engage a consultant at their cost to help them through the process. If they choose to go and engage a consultant to help them through the process and incur the thousands of dollars that that involves, then that's a matter for them. But no-one's forcing them to do that. No-one's forcing them or compelling them to do anything. We're offering a different version of the same multi-employer bargaining that you saw fit to preside over, but apparently it's not okay when a Labor government tries to do it.</span>

The Office of Best Practice Regulation's assessment was that the regulatory impact statement is 'adequate and therefore sufficient to inform decision'. However, the letter states that to have been assessed as good practice under the guide the regulatory impact statement would have benefited from further analysis of the potential impacts on productivity, real wages and other distributional impact, in particular on gender, and that statements or evidence that the regulatory costs and their assumptions had been tested with stakeholders or otherwise an acknowledgement of why this has not been undertaken.</span>

It was what was needed. I know that a lot of these questions go to gender impacts of the bill. I've already made the point that this bill is going to be doing an enormous amount to rectify and close the gender pay gap that exists in Australia and that has been happening for a very long time. I know your government used to crow about closing the gender pay gap, but you always left out the bit that the reason that happened was that male wages were falling. So to close the gender pay gap in the Liberal-National world was to see wages decline for one part of the community. What we actually want to see is the gender pay gap closing with both gender's pay going up; that's the way to close the gender pay gap. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, this bill does an enormous amount to address gender inequality in industrial relations in Australia by including gender equality as an overarching object of the Fair Work Act; by implementing the government's election commitment to establish expert panels for pay equity; and by including the care and community sector in the Fair Work Commission, backed by a dedicated research unit. There are the issues around banning pay secrecy clauses and allowing staff to talk about their pay if they want to, which is particularly important for women; there is stamping out workplace sexual harassment; and there is extending eligibility for flexible work requests to cover cases where the employee is pregnant. Any reasonable observer would see that this bill is going to do more for gender equality in the workplace than we have seen in this country for a very, very long time. It's a shame that the former government didn't do anything about these issues for the 10 years that it was in power.</span>

The issue I have with the answer that you just gave is that you have stated that the regulatory impact statement says it is adequate. You've accepted that and therefore you've discharged your obligations. You then went on about a number of impacts in relation to gender. The issue I have is this, though. What the regulatory impact statement says is that the RIS would have benefited from further analysis of the potential impact, in particular on gender. Given that statement, and given your commitment in this bill to the improvements in gender equity, when the minister received this and it said 'further analysis of the potential impacts on productivity, real wages and other distributional impacts, in particular on gender', what action was taken? </span>

We've heard this evening how the character of the Fair Work Commission is going to be very important to the way in which the promise of this bill unfolds and is realised. What kind of expertise in relation to gender, equal remuneration, job security and so on is going to be essential in the commission to realise the promise of the bill and, in particular, the expertise in the two new panels established, one on care and community and one on gender equality?</span>

I again recognise your many years of working and campaigning on these issues. You're dead right: it is important. An understanding and appreciation of gender issues and gender inequality is a really important characteristic, I think and the government thinks, of members of the commission. You're probably aware that one of the things that we're proposing to do here is to establish two particular panels, one concerning pay equity and one concerning, I think, the care and community sector. We would certainly expect that the commissioners who are involved in those panels would have a particular understanding of these issues. So I do think that it improves decision-making on gender inequality issues if the people making these decisions—the commissioners—have a deep understanding of these issues. That's certainly the path we want to go down.</span>

It would be somewhat ironic if we weren't open to part-time membership of these sorts of panels that are considering gender inequality issues. What I'm advised is that expert panel members can be appointed on a full-time basis but also can be appointed on a part-time basis, for a five-year term. The part-time nature of this appointment reflects the short-term nature of the tasks these experts are appointed to perform, for example, the annual wage review. The president will also have the power to appoint full-time members to panels based on their expertise, and that will give the commission some flexibility with its resourcing.</span>

In terms of the Office of Best Practice Regulation assessment tiers, there are actually, I understand, four—insufficient, adequate, good practice and exemplary practice. Let's go through them again. Insufficient—bad, bad. Adequate—mmm. Good practice—we're starting to get there. And then there's exemplary practice. Page 55 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guide </span><span style="font-style:italic;">to </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Regulatory Impact Analysis</span> describes 'adequate' as follows: </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to the Office of Best Practice's assessment. It says the regulatory impact statement would have benefited from 'statements or evidence that the regulatory costs'—and we'll pursue them—'and their assumptions had been tested with stakeholders, or otherwise an acknowledgment why this was not undertaken'. What action did the government take in that regard? Given, in particular, the fact that the RIS is merely assessed as adequate, it means it has a number of shortcomings in its analysis and/or the policy development process used to underpin the analysis, such as not conducting a reasonable level of consultation. So, when presented with statements or evidence that the regulatory costs and their assumptions had been tested with stakeholders or, otherwise, an acknowledgment of why this had not been undertaken, what action did the minister take?</span>

So it sounds to me as though the work that was done was deemed to be sufficient to make a decision, and that's what we've done. I think it would probably be interesting to find out whether regulation and legislation that occurred while you, Senator Cash, were a minister ever hit the 'adequate' note as well. I suspect that it has probably been the case in most ministers' careers that sometimes it's deemed to be a higher level or a lower level, and I suspect we could find examples where that happened when you were the minister as well. But, given that this point ultimately relates to gender inequality, I've already given references to the extensive work that occurred to ensure that the act delivered on gender equality in the workplace and I've already run through the numerous ways in which the bill does that.</span>

Given that we all accept 'adequate', 'good enough to inform a decision', 'too bad, so sad' about what the Office of Best Practice Regulation actually said, why did the government not take any further action when it was advised by the Office of Best Practice Regulation that the regulatory impact statement could be improved? You actually have had an opportunity to provide an updated explanatory memorandum as well. Is there a reason that this was not addressed?</span>

There has been extensive consultation both prior to and after the receipt of that letter. But, again, we make no apologies for bringing this legislation to the chamber to get it passed before Christmas, because Australians have been waiting for 10 years to have an IR system which delivers fair pay rises so that people can keep up with the cost of living. I know that your government had a different policy. I know that your government's policy was to keep wages suppressed and to keep productivity low. We don't want that. We don't want workers or businesses to have to wait a day longer than is necessary to get the system working so that we get wages moving and we get productivity moving, which will benefit the Australian economy overall.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the Office of Best Practice Regulation has criticised the department for not providing evidence that the regulatory costs and their assumptions have been tested with stakeholders. If you go to page 50 of the regulatory impact statement, it says 'the impact on employers of option 2, improving access to single and multi-employer agreements'. This section refers to a number of assumptions—and we will go through the assumptions—that underpin the department's estimate that the cost of multi-employer bargaining changes—and I want to pursue an answer you gave previously, when I said the cost to small business was around $14,500 and you yelled out 'not true'; I would like to pursue why you say that's not true.</span>

If you go to page 53 of the regulatory impact statement, it sets them out. It says this: 'Therefore, the total cost per business using these estimates are cost of bargaining per business plus cost of external consultants per business. Small business, $14,638. Medium business, $75,148'—we now know that's not true; there was a $5,000 typo which actually increased, not decreased, the cost of business—and the cost of a large business is $94,311. So, when I said the cost of bargaining per business plus cost as outlined in your RIS was $14,638 for a small business, why is that untrue?</span>

The reason I was saying you were wrong earlier and I'm saying you're wrong now is that you and your colleagues have repeatedly cited those figures as being so-called evidence that any business that wants to take part in the type of bargaining that's been put forward here will incur those costs. That is not true. That assumes that the relevant business decides to go and get its own consultants, its own lawyers, its own this, its own that, when that is not the only option they have available to them. As I said earlier in the debate, what I would expect would happen is we would see some of the employer groups, whether they be industry based or across industry, develop agreements as a service to their members that their members, the individual businesses, may choose to then join up to. If businesses decided to do that, they wouldn't need to incur the cost of external consultants. All it would cost them is their usual membership fee for that association. Those employer groups already provide an extensive range of industrial relations services to their members. This would become another one that they could offer. So to claim, as you and your colleagues have now for a number of weeks, that any business that wants to participate in this is going to be up for tens of thousands of dollars is completely untrue, and you know that. But you continue to say it because it feeds your scare campaigns and your narrative. It's just not true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, what you've failed to point out again is the following words that are in the regulatory impact statement, which are: 'The significant benefits of being covered by an enterprise agreement and the cost that may be associated with remaining covered by a modern award outweigh the additional cost for businesses to engage with the new multi-enterprise bargaining streams.' If you're going to be citing things from the regulatory impact statement, (a) you might owe it to people to be complete and (b) you might owe it to people to not misrepresent what it's saying. People do not have to choose this option if they don't want to.</span>

Let's now talk about some further assumptions, seeing as you're all over business and all over what businesses are going to do. The first is: how many small businesses in Australia are a member of an association?</span>

I base that on the repeated comments from employer groups that they speak for small businesses in this country. If the likes of ACCI, COSBOA, AiG and all the other employer groups say they represent small businesses or medium-size businesses in this country, then they must represent a very large number, and they must be very capable of developing agreements that their members could then sign up to. Frankly, I think that part of their responsibility to their members is to provide them with that industrial relations assistance so that they can have that assistance from their member body.</span>

I note the government's assumption that on average 15.2 employers—I'd love you to explain the 0.2 to me, because I'm a little confused about the 0.2—will bargain together under the one multi-employer agreement. Where did the 15.2 come from, and what does the 0.2 represent?</span>

I personally find it fascinating, colleagues, that competitors who are forced to bargain are going to say, 'We'll just give you all our information, and then you can negotiate between the 15.2 employers and come up with a one-size-fits-all agreement.' But my question to you is this: did the government put this proposition to employers?</span>

We aren't talking about the regime that exists today. We are talking about the regime that will exist when this legislation passes. You've made assumptions that on average 15.2 employers will bargain together under the one multi-employer agreement and that they will pool their money. You've got to remember that in this scenario the 15.2 could have been compelled to bargain. That is not something that currently occurs. You've assumed that they will only hire one or two consultants—so the 15 of them might be in competition, but each one of them is going to say, 'We'll only hire one or two consultants'—to represent them during the negotiations. Did the government put this proposition to employers?</span>
