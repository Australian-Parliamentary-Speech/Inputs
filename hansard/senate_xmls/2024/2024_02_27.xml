That, too, was without a shred of evidence, as we found out through my questioning of Minister Wong. Your hypocrisy knows no bounds. You did not hesitate to collectively punish millions of Palestinians by freezing the life-saving aid to UNRWA without any basis for Israel's claims. But there's not even a slap on the wrist of Israel. In fact, there's unquestioning support for Israel to commit the crime of all crimes: genocide.</span>

There is catastrophic famine, hunger, starvation and disease looming large in Gaza, yet it has been 31 days since you suspended funding to UNRWA, which is the largest relief agency in Gaza.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Is the minister aware of the acronym WCNSF: 'wounded child, no surviving family'? Some of these children are babies, toddlers who don't yet speak. No-one knows their names and no-one ever will. Some of these children cannot speak anymore due to what they have witnessed, and they are being denied even the aid that was going to them so that they can live. How will these people go on without aid? Do they not need help? Do they not need aid? Do you not see them as humans?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor thinks that falsely accusing us Greens of causing division over and over will somehow make this lie true. But we are holding you to account for your role in supporting Israel's genocide and cutting aid, your role in the occupation and oppression of Palestinians. Don't you dare try and divert attention from these dire needs by your inexcusable moral bankruptcy and utter hypocrisy. And, while I'm at it, if you're not going to show up for the community now, don't you dare show up for photoshoots at our iftars next month. It is beyond inhumane to suspend aid at any time, but you have done so at the worst possible time for Palestinians—when they are being butchered, indiscriminately massacred, starved and forcibly displaced under the guise of self-defence by the belligerent, bloodthirsty State of Israel.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">It is with profound regret that I must now inform you that the Agency has reached breaking point, with Israel's repeated calls to dismantle UNRWA and the freezing of funding by donors at a time of unprecedented humanitarian needs in Gaza.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">How much more often do you need to hear about the absolutely drastic need to restore this funding? Labor is facilitating Israel's long-term mission to disband UNRWA. It seems now the State of Israel dictates not only our foreign policy in the Middle East but also our aid policy. Shame on you! Restore UNRWA funding and rapidly increase it. After all your wrongs and all your screw-ups, it is the least you can do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  Once again the coalition absolutely does not support the Greens' attempt to suspend standing orders to attempt to debate an entirely one-sided, misleading and inflammatory motion. We have repeatedly seen the Greens behave disgracefully over the crisis in the Middle East by refusing to acknowledge that it is the terrorist organisation Hamas that is responsible for the death and conflict in Gaza. It is Hamas which broke a ceasefire and murdered 1,200 women, children and men in cold blood. It is Hamas which took hundreds of hostages, who have been held in atrocious conditions for more than four months and still refuses to release them today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all want this conflict to end as soon as possible. We all want to see civilian casualties minimised. Hamas could have surrendered at any point. They could have released the hostages—those innocent civilian hostages—at any point. But once again we see the Greens coming into this parliament with a motion that completely ignores the fact that the Hamas terrorists can end the conflict in Gaza today and ensure aid can flow to the people who need it without restriction. If the Greens want to suspend standing orders to debate the situation in Gaza or debate UNRWA, then they should do so on a motion which accepts the facts rather than misrepresents them and deliberately omits any mention of Hamas. It is very, very troubling to see a political party in this country adopt a deliberate strategy of ignoring the horrific crimes of Hamas terrorists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion for the suspension of standing orders, just like so many of the stunts that the Greens have attempted, is designed to create media stories which shift the focus away from what Hamas is doing, from the crimes that Hamas is committing. It is a fact—and, indeed, one that has been called out from many quarters, including from the government—that the Greens, as a fringe political movement, are seeking, with stunts like these, to ingratiate themselves with the hard left fringe, which also wants to let Hamas off the hook for its terrorism. The most hypocritical part of their actions is that it is Hamas which is the cause of the death and suffering of people in Gaza. Once again, the Greens are seeking to suspend standing orders to debate a motion about death and suffering in Gaza which doesn't even mention Hamas, which is the cause of that death and the cause of that suffering. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They seek to suspend standing orders to debate a motion calling for the immediate restoration of funding to UNRWA, even though UNRWA itself dismissed members of its own staff for alleged involvement in the 7 October terrorist attacks. How irresponsible can the Australian Greens be, to seek to suspend standing orders to try and get the Senate to call for the restoration of funding to an organisation which is currently under investigation for having staff participate in a terrorist attack? No Australian taxpayer money should ever go to an organisation involved in supporting terrorism, and it is staggering that the Greens come into this chamber and want to move for the suspension of standing orders to try and debate a motion calling for funding to be restored, before an investigation is even complete.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has been using the usual forms of parliament, including the Senate estimates process, including question time, to ask important questions of the government regarding UNRWA. We have taken the opportunity to ask questions about the various other aid agencies which are being funded by both the Australian government and other nations to provide critical aid and support in Gaza. Rather than seeking to suspend standing orders as a stunt, as the Greens are doing right now, we in the coalition have been asking substantive questions about the potential for organisations like the Red Cross to provide more assistance, noting that the government has announced additional funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than trying to suspend standing orders to demand funding be restored to UNRWA, even though UNRWA sacked staff due to alleged participation in terror attacks and remains under investigation, Greens senators in this place could be asking questions of substance about whether Australia and like-minded countries can support the civilian population through other reputable aid organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We oppose the suspension of standing orders because the Greens have demonstrated time and again that they aren't responsible. Each and every time they raise this issue in this chamber, it is with the aim of minimising blame on Hamas.</span>

                  </a>  There are two facts we can't ignore in relation to UNRWA. It does life-saving work, but the recent allegations against its staff are grave and need to be fully investigated. This life-saving work is why Australian governments of both stripes have provided funding to UNRWA since 1951. That is why our closest partners, including the United States, the UK and Canada, all make major contributions. Right now, more than 1.4 million Palestinians are sheltering in UNRWA facilities, and thousands of its staff are involved in the humanitarian response in Gaza. But it's also a fact that serious allegations have been raised about some UNRWA staff. Australia welcomed UNRWA's swift response to those allegations, including terminating staff and launching an investigation, as well as its recent announcement that former French foreign minister Colonna will chair a full independent review of UNRWA. I refer you to the statement by UNRWA on 26 January which made it clear that the allegations were so serious that UNRWA had immediately terminated the contracts of some staff members. This was underlined again last week by an UNRWA spokesperson who said that they fired people on the basis of how serious the allegations are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is now working with a number of countries that are in the same position as us. We want to provide urgent humanitarian aid to people in Gaza. Collectively, we are making clear to UNRWA that it needs to demonstrate strong, transparent and accountable leadership for the international community to move forward together. We need to re-establish confidence that money is being used properly and that problems will be addressed. While this work is being done, we are temporarily pausing recently announced funding. Australia and 14 other countries temporarily paused funding as it was reasonable in these circumstances. They include Germany, Sweden, Japan and the Netherlands. Are the Greens suggesting that Australia, Germany, Sweden, Japan, the Netherlands and other donor countries should have ignored UNRWA's own actions?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because the Greens only see this conflict as a political campaigning device, they have ignored that this government has doubled core funding to UNRWA, and their tactics are the same as those opposite. To be clear, Australia's $20 million in core annual funding has already been delivered in full this financial year; delivery of an additional $6.5 million in UNRWA's flash appeal has been paused temporarily. Since the beginning of this crisis, Australia has provided $46.5 million in humanitarian assistance, and the full amount will be delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said, there are two facts that we can't ignore in relation to UNRWA. They do life-saving work, but the recent allegations against their staff are grave and need to be investigated. The UN and other donors have acted on the seriousness of these allegations and are doing so in good faith. If only the Greens also acted in good faith! Instead, we know they are only looking to how they can use this crisis to whip up anger for votes. It is a really despicable way to treat such an important issue.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  These bills are being put forward in the context of a cost-of-living crisis. There is absolutely no doubt that under the Labor Albanese government Australia is in a cost-of-living crisis. Every time the senators in this place go back to their home states and talk to their constituents, to families in their home states—in my case the state of Queensland—the cost-of-living crisis its impact on Queensland families is underlined to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Senator Hume, on behalf of the coalition, made her opening contribution in relation to this bill she referred to the hearings of the Select Committee on the Cost of Living. The Senate formed a cost-of-living committee to look at the issue of cost-of-living in this context. The committee visited Gladstone, and Senator Hume conveyed to this chamber how, when she visited Gladstone in the context of that cost-of-living committee, Gladstone council conveyed to the committee that there are young people living in my home state of Queensland, in Gladstone, who are making decisions now as to whether they pay the rent or whether they go and see a GP to get medical care. Those are the sorts of decisions people are making today in the middle of this cost-of-living crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am seeing exactly the same thing where my office is located, in the greater Ipswich region. Most of Ipswich is located within the federal seat of Blair, a Labor-held seat. There was research released this week in relation to bulk-billing rates in GP medical clinics in the federal seat of Blair—indeed, across the whole of Australia. What did that research indicate, Mr Deputy President? It indicated that over the course of 2023—only 12 months—the number of GP medical clinics in the federal seat of Blair, which includes much of Ipswich, fell from 26 to 15—26 down to 15. So that means, for an adult who isn't on a concession and who contacts a GP medical clinic in the City of Ipswich within the Labor-held federal seat of Blair, that the number of medical clinics offering bulk-billing in the region where my office is located has fallen from 26 to 15, a 36 per cent drop over the course of just 12 months. That is a staggering fall in just 12 months, and that is under the watch of the Albanese Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in a cost-of-living crisis. There is absolutely no doubt about it, and that is why the coalition is not going to stand in the way of providing tax cuts to Australians—from 19 per cent to 16 per cent. We can't stand in the way of that tax relief for Australians who are doing it tough. But Australians must always remember that this bill which we're debating today means that Australians cannot take the Labor government at its word with respect to any tax matter. Remember when the Prime Minister said, 'My word is my bond'? This bill demonstrates that the Prime Minister's word is not his bond. This bill demonstrates that Labor cannot be trusted with respect to whatever it says and whatever it commits to with respect to taxation, whether it's in relation to negative gearing, capital gains tax, franking credits or superannuation. Whatever it is, this bill demonstrates and is evidence—exhibit A—that the Albanese Labor government cannot be trusted with respect to anything that it says in relation to tax. It will promise one thing before an election and then do something else after an election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one other matter which Senator Hume touched upon that I want to address in my remarks in relation to this legislation. I genuinely think this is appalling. It is absolutely appalling—on the same day that the Albanese Labor government announced $14 million of funding for food relief agencies. And the food bank in the greater Ipswich region, where my office is located, is telling me they're seeing a lot of people and working families they've never seen before. I've actually spoken to a lot of those people at the food bank at Ipswich Assist in Ipswich, and I pay tribute to all of the volunteers at Ipswich Assist—Jason and his team. They're seeing people they've never seen before. On the same day that the federal government announced $14 million of funding for food relief agencies, the coalition discovered that the Labor government is spending $40 million on marketing this bill—this broken promise. Can you believe that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just think about it. We're in a cost-of-living crisis, our food relief agencies are seeing people they've never seen before, and the Albanese Labor government is providing $14 million for food relief agencies but spending $40 million—nearly three times as much—to market their broken promise. How contemptible! It is shameful. That is $14 million to help food relief agencies and $40 million on marketing, which is not necessary at all. It is absolutely not necessary. There isn't a question of you needing to apply for the tax cuts under this bill. They work automatically through the ATO. There's no educational component to this whatsoever. It's not as if you've got to educate people to participate in a government scheme. It's shameful, but it is even more shameful when you put that expenditure of $40 million on a marketing campaign against $14 million of relief for food relief agencies. There could be no better example that the Albanese Labor government is out of touch with Australians suffering in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just reflect on that: $40 million to market the broken promise represented by this bill but only $14 million to food relief agencies to help Australians in need. This is a government that has got all of its priorities wrong. It should be held accountable by the people at the next election.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="250156" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  I speak today on the stage 3 tax cut bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, and the related bill. There are many parts of the world where people are willing to pay higher taxes—particularly income taxes—than we do in Australia. Think about that; there are parts of the world where people are willing to pay more and higher taxes than we do in Australia because they actually trust that the government will spend those funds in a way that benefits the majority—housing, education, health care. There are many examples of these countries—Iceland, Finland, Sweden, Denmark. These are all nations with a higher level of income tax than we have in Australia. They are also all countries that beat Australia in last year's world happiness index.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a broken tax system in Australia. Year after year the government fails to spend public funds appropriately. And the result of this broken tax system is that our world-class health system is now pushed to the brink. We have a rental and housing crisis—the worst it has been in generations. Our education system leaves more and more kids behind every single year. And we have a cost-of-living crisis that means that a block of cheese now costs more than a Macca's meal. Just think about how broken that is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stage 3 tax cut bill as originally proposed by the Morrison government did the opposite of benefiting the majority. It benefited a tiny minority of high-income earners, most of whom were pulling in $180,000 a year. As someone who would have benefited from the original plan, we should have never, ever been the focus of that legislation. We should not have been the priority. Odds are we would have been more than fine without it. The relief that this government didn't proceed with that plan is palpable. It would have been ridiculous and devastating in terms of its consequences, and that's why the Greens will be supporting Labor's amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it must not be the last that is seen of this government's supposed generosity. The reality right now is that Australians are being hit from all sides by this cost-of-living crisis. The median income in Australia is around $67,000 annually. For folks on this wage, these changes mean that they may take home about $50 extra a fortnight. In most states, the reality is that is not enough to cover the average cost of the gap payment when you see the GP. In most states—or anywhere in this country right now, let's be honest—$50 a fortnight will not cover your grocery shop. It is not going to get you much closer to covering your monthly or weekly rent. Let's be really clear: the average rental payment in Australia right now is $580 a week. And with Australia's median property value being $750,000 as of last December, if you put this extra money away towards saving up a 20 per cent deposit for a mortgage, to try to buy that home, it would take you roughly 116 years to build up the amount of money to do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this reality, the government says, 'Well, maybe you can put this money aside in a savings account, with a fairly generous four per cent interest rate.' In that scenario, if you did that, if you were the kind of good little saver that the government often suggests people experiencing poverty should be—and let me share from personal experience. As somebody whose family has always struggled, there is nothing more infuriating, when you are in a position trying to figure out where next week's shop money is going to come from, how you're going to make things work on the DSP and how you're going to cover your specialist medical bills, than to feel that you're being told by people in positions of power that you are experiencing that because you are not as good as you should be at saving. Let's have a look at what that would do if you put that money away in a savings account. It would take you 45 years to build up that 20 per cent deposit. In this context, I do not blame the Australian community for not trusting either side of politics with their money. In a cost-of-living crisis, both sides of politics have left them out in the cold—or more accurately, if you're from Western Australia, in the scorching heat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments to the stage 3 tax cuts bill are a start, a tiny step in the direction towards actually providing people with the support they need. But Labor must take bolder actions to level the playing field and provide tangible supports and improvements to people's lives. They must listen to the Greens and the community's call for a raise to the disability support pension that allows disabled people to live beyond poverty. They must listen to the Greens and the community's call to bring dental care and mental health care fully into Medicare and to actually tax the billionaires so that the Gina Rineharts and the Twiggy Forrests and corporations like Woodside actually pay their fair share of tax. Without taking such actions, it is hard to interpret this bill as little more than a hollow gesture.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I'm very happy to get into this debate because this is something the Greens, and only the Greens, have been campaigning on now for the last five years. We can go back to when these tax cuts were first announced under the previous government two parliaments ago. The original legislation was supported by Senator Lambie and former senators Patrick and Griff from the Xenophon party. Once their support was secured, of course the now government, the Labor Party, backed them in too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It took years of Greens pressure to finally get the government to drop the Liberal Party's tax cuts. Pressure works. I've got to say, it may have been the Greens in this place that applied that pressure, but there were a lot of stakeholders out there that were working towards this as well, and I'd like to acknowledge them today. And, of course, many commentators, economists and journalists are raising valid concerns and questions about this legislation on a number of different levels.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But these tax cuts will still make economic inequality in Australia worse by giving politicians, such as me, and others on incomes over $200,000—millionaires and potentially billionaires—significant tax cuts. I think I get as a senator—and I'm not sure what other senators' salaries are in this place, but I suspect they'll be fairly similar—about $5,000 a year in tax cuts. I've been asked about this publicly on the radio. I feel very conflicted about that. I don't feel like I need that money as much as other people in this country do. The Greens put forward sensible suggestions—that for those on incomes over $200,000, like most of us in this chamber, that money go towards directly benefitting Australians who are doing it tough. There are a whole range of things I'll mention in a second that we could fund if we amended this legislation to make a cut-off at $200,000. On these salaries, we get three times the value of tax cuts compared to the average Australian worker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These revised tax cuts that we're dealing with today will make inequality worse by providing the poorest 20 per cent of society with only 0.4 per cent of the share of tax cuts in the next financial year. That's compared to the wealthiest of society—that includes us, again—who will enjoy half the total value of these tax cuts. They are predominantly going to benefit the wealthy in this country. We have seen evidence that they will exacerbate the gender-pay gap, with 42 per cent of the tax cuts going to women and 58 per cent going to men. That's obviously a very topical issue in the media today. It'll make inequality in Australia worse by starving the budget by a jaw-dropping $318 billion over the next decade. This massive bucket of revenue means that the biggest unspoken losers from these tax cuts will be people who rely on strong public services, like aged care, the NDIS and income support, and all the families who depend on the public education and health systems. There is only a certain amount of money that is in the pool to go around, and there will be pressure brought to bear to find savings in public services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Press Club, when announcing the policy reversal, the Prime Minister said 'no-one held back and no-one left behind', but everyone on income support and everyone earning below $18,000 a year—and there are a lot of Australians earning below $18,000 a year—get nothing to deal with the cost-of-living crisis. The government could have made these tax cuts quarantine people such as ourselves who are earning over $200,000 a year. That would have freed up billions to invest in things like adding mental health and dental health into Medicare, something the Greens were proudly able to bring in for children back in 2010 that we've never been able to have extended to adults in this country. We've got a state election in Tasmania, and we've been out doorknocking and talking to people who are doing it really tough in this cost-of-living crisis. I can tell you, I met a woman who has been on the public waiting list to get some dental work for nearly five years. She told me how many teeth she'd lost in that period of time, how much pain she'd been in and the number of times she's had to go to GPs. It really hits home how hard it is for some people in this country because we don't have dental care in Medicare. It would be an absolute winner for the current government, or any government, to implement such a simple measure. We could fund that by not giving wealthy people in this country a tax cut that, I would argue, they don't need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Free child care is another thing the Greens have been arguing for. Wiping student debt and building the clean-energy system our planet needs are others. We could also fully fund threatened-species recovery plans, which have received virtually no funding under respective federal governments in the last 15 years. At a time when we're starting to see the extinction crisis hit hard, there's never been a more important time to invest in a healthy environment than now. It's not just because we're green, we're conservationists and we want to protect nature; we need this in order to have healthy communities. I would argue that that is also a priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps something a little bit personal to me: we are concluding a Senate inquiry into the Australian Antarctic Division, and senators from all political parties have been involved in this. We've heard about a number of critical science programs being cut, delayed or deferred because the AAD is short $25 million. This is at a time when we're seeing the biggest loss of marginal sea ice in recorded history and very real concerns about the temperatures of our oceans and the kinds of things we need to be researching now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that point, the ABC ran an article yesterday on the RV <span style="font-style:italic;">Investigator</span>, an absolutely brilliant floating science platform based out of Hobart which was originally a Labor government commitment. I must say, I commend the previous Liberal government for fully funding the RV <span style="font-style:italic;">Investigator</span> for 300 days a year for marine science. We find that their funding has been cut too. They're back to around 180 days, so back to where they started before we campaigned so hard to get the RV <span style="font-style:italic;">Investigator</span> fully funded. I look at that and I think, 'Wow, that's $50 million for doing critical ocean research right now.' The ocean is the barometer of our planet's health, weather, climate and so many other things, and we don't have the money to fund our scientists to do this work at a time in history when we most need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at this $318 billion and I really scratch my head. How is it that we're cutting back on these absolutely critical programs just to give rich people in this country a tax cut? Whenever the Treasurer says we can't afford things like superannuation or paid parental leave, it's because the cost of these tax cuts makes everything else unaffordable. To put the cost of these tax cuts into perspective, here are some more of our policies that the Greens would like to see implemented over the decade. We believe putting mental health into Medicare would cost around $91 billion over the next decade; dental into Medicare, $10 billion; wiping student debt, $17 billion; free child care, $90 billion—that would actually cost less now that we've seen some legislated changes—and, generically, billions into building affordable housing, free public transport, faster rail between our cities and building renewable energy and storage. We need to get to net zero by 2035. Of course, this country is experiencing the costs of climate change right now. Just looking all around the country this summer, the costs of extreme weather events will only get worse. The cost of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. The loss of giant kelp forests in the Great Southern Reef is impacting the fishing industry. The costs of climate change by far outweigh the cost of taking action, and we're just not doing that fast enough or strong enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish my contribution by talking a bit about my home state of Tasmania. Yes, there is a Tasmanian state election on at the moment. Look at what that government's priorities are—not to mention that the Tasmanian Liberal government is the last Liberal government left in the states here in Australia. How much money are we putting towards a stadium that no-one wants at Macquarie Point? Bread and circuses has been a very successful formula since the Roman days, but in this situation we have money for circuses in Tasmania but no money for bread. We've got no money for those who are experiencing firsthand the devastation of this cost-of-living crisis. We have a federal government that wants to put $240 million towards building infrastructure, which is loose code for funding this Macquarie Point AFL stadium—a stadium, by the way, that we don't need. We've got a really good stadium in at York Park Launceston. It has been used by Hawthorn for many years. It's also getting a $90 million upgrade. It's a state-of-the-art facility, but somehow the AFL has us over a barrel and they want us to build a billion-dollar stadium down at Macquarie Point, a completely inappropriate location.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you dig into the $240 million, it's not money going directly to the stadium or for other redevelopment at the Macquarie Point site. It was revealed in Senate estimates last week by my colleague Senator McKim that federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers has refused the state government's request to provide a GST exemption for any funds towards the Macquarie Point megastadium. That means Tasmania will lose out on $240 million, basically. We're not going to get the GST revenue that we so critically need to try to tackle the public health crisis in my state. We have some of the worst outcomes for public health. We still have ambulance ramping. People are dying in ambulances because there are no beds in our public hospitals. The emergency rooms are full because people can't afford to go to a GP, so they go to the emergency room. That's the only benefit they can get, and then they spend days waiting to be seen. People are dying on ambulance ramps because we haven't fixed that. That's just one of the problems. We have people sleeping in cars. When the Prime Minister swung into Tasmania last year to offer this money he went past hundreds of people sleeping in their cars. There's no public housing. The state government has built hardly any, and we're yet to see any funds flow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got our priorities all wrong. We are putting money towards a stadium we don't need—which, I may say, is deeply unpopular in Tasmania, because Tasmanians aren't going to be conned; they're smarter than the Tasmanian Liberal Party, the Prime Minister and the federal government think they are. We all want an AFL team, but we don't want the money to be spent on a stadium when it is desperately needed elsewhere. So I strongly suggest that both the federal government and the Tasmanian state government have their priorities all wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They've been caught out, too, because Minister Ferguson, the state growth minister in Tasmania, announced this publicly only last week. He sat on the fact that the state was not going to be GST-exempt, right until the last minute, until his hand was forced to release a statement. That means the Premier's promises that they would cap expenditures on the stadium are false. There's no way around that. We know, based on other stadiums around the country, that this stadium will blow out. We looked at your stadium in Western Australia, Acting Deputy President Sterle, and a great stadium it is, but it had a significant cost blowout, and we'll see that with a Tasmanian stadium if it's built on that site. There are much better options.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the Tasmanian people can see through this, I hope they vote for a political party that has its priorities right, and that is the Greens political party. The Greens have clearly said that they oppose spending $1 billion on a stadium, that they oppose federal government funding going into the stadium. They would like to see more assistance, whether through maintaining that GST revenue or through direct funding being put into our public health system. No doubt we'll have more to say on that in the weeks to come. We would also like to see the federal government fully funding the rollout of public housing in Tasmania where it's so desperately needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we deal with these priorities, these problems that, by the way, have been going on for decades, then let's talk about a new stadium for the AFL team in Tasmania. I hope the team still goes ahead, because, as I said, we have a perfectly good stadium in my home town of Launceston, at York Park. We don't need to be spending money on a new stadium when there are so many more important priorities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="169119" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHOEBRIDGE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  I rise to speak to this 'Treasury laws amendment (Labor's not quite as rubbish as the coalition!) bill 2024'. We know what Labor is offering with this bill. They're offering, to people who are on income support or those earning less than $18,000 a year, nothing—nothing. They're offering, to people on middle incomes, maybe an extra $15 a week while giving 4½ grand a year to millionaires, billionaires and politicians. That's the 'Treasury laws amendment (Labor's not quite as rubbish as the coalition!) bill 2024'. And, make no mistake, the wealthiest people in this country are laughing at this bill. They're very happy with this bill, and the millions and millions that they've invested—money well spent. And the Labor Party and the coalition—well, they're getting their payoff again from the Labor Party. In a housing and cost-of-living crisis, watching Labor give the very wealthy three times as much as the average wage earner in this country, or more, is kind of obscene. And for them then to be cheering it in, as though they're the party of the working class and the struggler, is pretty hard to stomach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For comparison, let's look at some of the numbers. The bulk of Australians get about $15 a week with these tax cuts, which is $15 a week more than they otherwise would have had, and I'm sure most people appreciate getting that $15 a week. But let's put it in context. That's less than half of the extra spending that people have had to do in the last 12 months—the $37 a week in extra spending to buy the same basket of groceries that they got 12 months ago. So $15 in tax cuts pays less than half of the increased cost of a basket of groceries at the supermarket.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And why is that happening? That's because Labor and the coalition, together, have never stood up to the price-gouging of the Woolies and Coles supermarket duopoly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lowest 10 per cent of taxpayers will receive about 10 per cent of the benefits of these tax cuts. So the people who need it most get the least. That's the design of Labor's slightly-less-crap-than-the-coalition's tax cuts. The people who most need income support and tax breaks get the least. And Labor wants us to cheer them on in this. Well, we're just not going to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Inequality in Australia has been growing rapidly, under both Labor and the coalition, for the last 15 years. Since 2009—and we've had Labor and the coalition in, at different times—the bottom 90 per cent of Australians have received just a few tiny crumbs of the economic growth that's been generated in this country, while the top 10 per cent of income earners have taken 93 per cent of the additional wealth that's been generated over the last 15 years. So the top 10 per cent have taken more than nine in 10 of the dollars of additional wealth that have been generated over the last 15 years, under both Labor and the coalition. And, in that time, the share of the economy that's gone to corporate profits has gone through the roof—at a level we haven't seen since the immediate postwar years, some 75 or 80 years ago. Inequality has been running rampant, and it hasn't mattered whether Labor has been in government or the coalition has been in government, because they've got the same basic economic agenda: they have in mind this kind of trickle-down economy, delivering to their corporate donors and wealthy mates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I say 'wealthy mates', we got a lesson in Labor's hugging of billionaires and wealthy mates just on the weekend, didn't we? While millions of Australians were struggling to put food on the table, and hundreds of thousands of Australian families found the last dollar in the bank account to get their daughter a ticket to Taylor Swift, or to pay the electricity bill, or to buy a decent basket of groceries, what was the Prime Minister doing on the weekend? He was trotting down to his mate Anthony Pratt's place—the billionaire packaging mogul, one of the richest Australians, who has, like, a speed-dial to the Prime Minister and the coalition leader. He trots down to Anthony Pratt's place and has a little private concert with Katy Perry. You couldn't make this up!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, was trotting down to have a private concert with Katy Perry at the mansion of a billionaire packaging mogul—who also just happened to have been a major donor for both Labor and the coalition over the last few decades—and he was doing it with this group of 200 political and business elites, who were swapping business cards, and working out where they'll go in their post-political career and, 'Who's going to pay for this policy?' and, 'How can we get more corporate profits going?' while listening to Katy Perry and drinking champagne in a billionaire's mansion. That's what the Prime Minister was doing on the weekend. And you want us to cheer in some tax cuts where Labor gives income earners $15 a week. Well, good luck with that. Good luck with selling that to the Australian public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You see, the Labor and Liberal parties—and the Nats, when they can—take millions in donations from big corporations, and then they write laws here to benefit them, and then they pretend: 'There's nothing we can do about it. This is just how the world has to be. And if you're not well off, we'll throw you a crumb. We'll throw you a crumb, and maybe with that crumb you'll be able to actually pay for the bus to work for that week. And good luck with that.' 'By the way, I'm off,' says the Labor Prime Minister. 'I'm off to my billionaire friend's mansion for the champagne and Katy Perry, but good luck with the 15 bucks a week. Good luck with that.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Parliamentary Budget Office, people making above 150 grand a year—that's the top eight per cent of income earners in the country—are going to get 40 per cent of the benefit of these tax cuts in the long run. That's 40 per cent to people who are already earning above 150 grand a year. The top five per cent of income earners, and that includes senators and members of the House of Reps—those making over 180 grand a year—will be getting a quarter of all the benefits. So what does that actually mean? That means over the next decade, that top five per cent—politicians, billionaires and everyone dancing to Katy Perry with the Prime Minister on the weekend—collectively will get $85 billion from these tax cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What else could we have done with $85 billion over the next decade? We could have given everybody access to dental care through Medicare. We could have put dental into Medicare for $77 billion. That's less than what these tax cuts are delivering to the top five per cent. Of course, I'm pretty sure that wasn't the message the Prime Minister got on the weekend when he was dancing to Katy Perry at Anthony Pratt's place. I'm pretty sure Anthony Pratt was saying: 'Good on you, Prime Minister.' Corporate profits are up; corporate taxes are low. 'You're not wasting money,' say the corporate donors. 'You're not wasting money on poor people, and we're still going to get a whacking great tax cut.' If Labor's test, going into the next election, is that they're slightly less crap than the coalition, then this is exhibit A.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  During the election campaign, Labor promised us a country where no-one is held back and no-one is left behind. Giving massive cash handouts to the rich and crumbs to everyone else seems like a pretty perverse way of delivering that. By proceeding with the stage 3 tax cuts in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, even after finally caving to pressure and making amendments, Labor has signed the death warrant on its own claims to progressivism. The single remaining virtue that the modern ALP can claim is that they are marginally less terrible than the Liberals—a party which in 2024 resembles a loose collection of culture war grievances more than a political organisation. Substantively, there is very little separating the old parties anymore. Friendly to big business, backing in more coal and gas, torturing asylum seekers and cutting taxes for the rich, they are on a unity ticket. At a time when we need to be investing more into our public services to support people, Labor is continuing the bipartisan, neoliberal project of shrinking the government and redistributing public money upwards into the hands of the rich.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of this government are very adept at putting on their serious faces and talking about how people are doing it tough. People aren't doing it tough. They're working two or three jobs just to keep from falling behind. They're dipping deeper into their pockets to pay for so-called public services like public schools and health care. They're sacrificing meals so that they can buy their kids clothes, and they're worried that their rent is going to go up $100 next month and they won't have a place to live. People are suffering from social isolation. People are poor and hungry. And here we have Labor trumpeting its fiscal rectitude while throwing wads of cash at millionaires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's tempting to say that it's surprising that a Labor government is so deeply hostile to the idea of well-funded public services and a robust and fair social safety net, but that would be to ignore the evidence of the last 40 years. Labor's fingerprints are all over the mess we're in. Take public education, for example. In 2011 the Gonski review handed down its report. It wasn't without its flaws, but its most significant recommendation was that school funding should be sector blind and needs based. To achieve this, governments would need to wind back their spending on the overfunded private sector and ramp up spending on the underfunded public sector. This was roundly endorsed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Labor, being Labor, blinked. Julia Gillard, who as education minister under Kevin Rudd commissioned the review, undermined Gonski's recommendations almost immediately, caving to pressure from the private school lobby by assuring them that no school would be worse off under the new funding arrangements. Out of this emerged a kind of Frankenstein funding model, where underfunded public schools were put on a pathway up to full funding, while overfunded private schools were put on a pathway down. It's now more than a decade since Gonski, and public schools are still trudging along that pathway. Even worse, since Gonski, on a per student basis, government funding to private schools has increased at twice the rate of funding to public schools. There's that upward wealth redistribution again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before and after the election Labor pledged to repair the damage they caused post Gonski by finally providing full and fair funding to public schools. But, having postponed negotiations on new funding agreements by a year to conduct yet another pointless review—and there have been 30 since Gonski—the statement of intent they signed with the WA government suggests they're not planning on delivering full funding at all. In fact, the deal they made, which is the model they intend to roll out to other states and territories, according to the minister, will lock in underfunding for the foreseeable future. That is because Labor has refused to rule out removing the Morrison-era accounting trickery that allows states and territories to include in their share of funding four per cent of non-school costs. I asked the government in Senate estimates to rule these dodgy clauses out of future bilateral agreements, and they would not. On <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders </span>on the weekend, the Minister for Education was asked if they would remove the clauses. He dodged the question. So here we have a Labor government gifting cash handouts to the wealthy while penny-pinching when it comes to the education of our most disadvantaged kids.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are the only members of this parliament who opposed the stage 3 tax cuts from day one. We were right to oppose them in 2018 and we are right to continue to call out their unfairness today. It took years of pressure from the Greens, the community and civil society organisations to finally shame Labor into amending stage 3. We were elected to resist Labor's worst tendencies and to push them to go further and faster on the issues that matter, and that is what we will continue to do. These tax cuts are not a win for Australia. While many Australians will gratefully welcome some more money in their pockets, the vast benefit of these cuts will go to the wealthiest Australians, who don't need it. Less than half of one per cent of the total value of these cuts will go to the poorest 20 per cent of Australians, while the wealthiest 20 per cent will bank half of the total value. Politicians and CEOs on incomes of more than $200,000 will pocket three times the value of tax cuts compared to the average worker. The tax cuts will widen the gender pay gap, with 42 per cent of the tax cuts going to women and 58 per cent to men.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately we will all pay from this wasteful extravagance. Starving the budget of $318 billion over a decade means the government will have less money to fund the public services that are needed now more than ever—things like aged care, the NDIS, income support, public schools, the health system and housing. Meanwhile, the people suffering the most during this cost-of-living crisis get nothing. If you're on income support or you earn less than $18,000, sorry, you're on your own. Labor can afford to give politicians and CEOs a $4½ thousand annual bonus, but you'll still have to try your luck at the food bank. The government could have quarantined these tax cuts so that people earning over $200,000 a year didn't get anything. That would have freed up billions to invest in things like bringing mental health and dental into Medicare, proving free child care, wiping student debt and making the transition to renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Next time Labor complain they just don't have enough money to do the things they really want to do, remember this moment, Madam Deputy President. Remember that they chose to give billions to the rich while services languished, Australians suffered and the inequality gap widened. The Greens will keep funding for a well-funded public services, a fair social safety net that lifts everyone out of poverty and precarity, and an end to the neoliberal consensus that harms us all.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:16</span>):  In the proud tradition of the major political parties of Australia, the Albanese Labor government continues to squib opportunities for significant tax reform. The stage 3 tax cuts promised to Australians by both major parties have not been delivered. More than a million Australians will be worse off. Bracket creep will take an additional $28 billion out of their pockets over the next decade, thanks to Labor's broken promise. We were told dozens of times that the full cuts would be delivered, while Labor was busy changing them. Labor cannot be trusted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation can be trusted. If we're in a position to do so after the next election, we'll ensure the full tax cuts promised to the Australian people are delivered. That's because One Nation does not support punishing success and aspiration. We don't subscribe to Anthony Albanese's politics of envy, his class warfare or his tall poppy syndrome. We don't trust Labor with Australians' money. We trust Australians with their own money, and we'd rather more of it were in their hands than in those of this reckless Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is especially the case right now, with Labor's other policies directly driving inflation and the national housing crisis. Labor pretend to deliver cost-of-living tax cuts with these bills, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024, but their other policies will negate any relief. Labor's record immigration is driving Australians into homelessness, and Labor's pathetic housing policy will do nothing to prevent it. Labor's reckless rush to renewables is driving up the energy bills of Australian households and businesses. Labor's many attacks on our farmers are driving up the cost of our groceries. Labor's attacks on small business and casual employment will drive up costs for consumers and kill jobs. Labor giveth and Labor taketh away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor cannot be trusted, but One Nation can be trusted. No-one is ever in doubt about what I'm doing, because I tell it like it is. Every Australian I talk to is worried about putting food on the table for their family. Every Australian I talk to is increasingly insecure about having a place to live. Every Australian I talk to thinks immigration levels are much too high. And every Australian I talk to says Labor cannot be trusted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The major parties must stop paying lip service to genuine tax reform. They must pull their finger out and actually do something. They could start with getting back to fundamentals. Taxes are required to ensure government can fund the things it must do. Taxes are not meant to be used to redistribute wealth or punish success and aspiration. It's time we looked at an overhaul of income tax, and we can start with a flat tax rate. One Nation considers that, above a tax-free threshold, there should be a flat income tax rates of 25c in place of progressive taxation and inevitable bracket creep. A person earning $30,000 a year will still pay 10 times less tax than a person earning $300,000 a year. This would mean we would not be punishing those who, through hard work and skill, earn more than others. It would still generate revenue, with increased discretionary spending contributing to the GST. They could invest their hard-earned money in Australian property to increase rental supply and relieve Australia's—Labor's—housing crisis. They could invest their hard-earned money in Australian companies and Australian small businesses, creating Australian jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many years One Nation has also been advocating for taxation reform regarding foreign-owned multinational resource companies. Many of them make billions of dollars in healthy profits from exploiting our natural resources. They pay virtually no tax in Australia for this exploitation. The major parties have squandered our natural wealth for decades, making Australia a cheap dirt mine. We could have had a sovereign wealth fund even bigger than Norway's, which is more than $2 trillion. One Nation considers that even minimum reform of taxation, like the petroleum resource rent tax, could generate $25 billion to $30 billion in additional revenue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To hear the Greens saying we should wipe the debt from students is ridiculous. There's a debt of over $60 billion owed by students who have gone to universities. They say they're not going to tax students going to universities, and we have people going to universities now who shouldn't be in universities; they don't have the qualifications. If you were to open it up for anyone to attend university, those hardworking taxpayers would then fund people who don't have to pay a cent towards it. If people don't pay and don't contribute, they won't put the work and effort into it. It is not up to the taxpayer. We have provided universities. Those who genuinely want to improve their lot in life, who want to study and learn, must pay their way. We expect people to fund their own health insurance, so they have to pay for their education. We have free education right up to year 12 for students, but it's not a given that you should get free education. Who is going to pay the $60 billion? Where is that going to come from? I have no problem with TAFE colleges, but we are pushing people through a university program where they are being brainwashed into an ideology where students believe they have to think that way to go out into the world. These are a lot of the things we need to address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Taxation is collected by governments. There are only two ways to fund it—through taxation or by increasing productivity. The government are continually raising taxes, and now Minister Plibersek is talking about putting a tax on clothing, which will only increasing the cost of living for the Australian people, because it will be passed on to the consumer. This would rake in another $37 billion in taxes that the Australian people can't afford. This is all the government do—more regulation and more control and more taxes put onto the Australian people who are struggling. They don't get it and don't understand how people are struggling with the cost of living, because they're only making it worse. I don't see government services getting productivity up. The government are not watching where the spending is going, and haven't even had an investigation into the Aboriginal industry, which I've been calling for for nearly 30 years, to find out where the money is going. They wasted $450 million on the Voice, and this money could have gone to taxation relief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, if we had a fair taxation policy where everyone paid the right amount of tax, if we had 25 per cent taxation right across the board, more people would actually show that they have earnt that money. They would have nothing to hide. Businesses wouldn't be paying employees under the counter. They would admit they've earnt the money, but they would go out there and spend it as well. People would actually save a lot of money in accountants while putting their taxation claims in. The Taxation Office would save a lot of money as well. How much does that cost the taxpayer?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no clear thinking or vision for this country at all. All the government are worried about is where they will reap the next round of money from. We have failing defence forces and veterans who have not been looked after properly. The farming sector is being destroyed because of the ideology of going after climate change or net zero, which is a big scam and which is costing the taxpayers billions of dollars to fund. If they think it's so good, then why don't they stand on their own two feet and prove to the Australian people that they can reduce the cost of it, instead of going for all these subsidies? What I see in this government is incompetency. You really have no idea what you're doing. That's why you ram legislation through this parliament. You don't open up for debate. You won't answer the questions. You can't answer the questions! It's the worst government that I've actually had to see working in progress while I've been in the parliament, from 1996 even to this time that I've been involved in the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unless you really truly want tax reform, you have to look at your own before you go taking these tax cuts off the Australian people. It was promised by the PM that he would not touch these personal tax cuts. He's lied again to the people. He is doing it. The fact is that you're trying to fill up the coffers because of the waste of money that you've allowed to happen. As far as I'm concerned, look at real tax reform. Incentivise people to get that second, third and fourth job. As one man up around Rockhampton said, he's got five jobs. How much of that money does he lose because of taxes? Put more money back into the pockets of the Australian people. They will spend it. They will make productivity. They will employ more. Instead of denying people tax cuts, what you should be looking at is working with the states to get rid of payroll tax. Incentivise companies and businesses to put on more employees instead of forcing them to pay a payroll tax through the states. All that people have seen is lies and more lies all the time. When we got the GST, we were told that all these other taxes would go. They never went. That's why the people don't trust governments or a lot of the politicians here anymore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just come up with something, will you? Both sides should get together to actually come up with something that is going to help the Australian people, because they are seriously struggling out there. These days, both parents have to go out and work to earn money, possibly even to pay a mortgage or a bill, and they're still struggling. And you keep hitting them with higher and higher taxes, one way or another, like the clothing tax that Plibersek is looking at. It just disgusts me that you can't come up with some decent solutions to actually pay down our debt to forge ahead in this country and create productivity. Your answer to it is to increase the immigration levels. That's all it is. Let's increase the immigration levels to—what was it? Nearly a million people? You're bringing 750,000 students into the country, causing a housing crisis. What are you doing?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't even look after the pensioners. That's another suggestion I'll give to you. Allow the age pensioners to work unlimited hours. Whatever they work, let them pay the taxes on the money that they've earnt without it affecting what they're entitled to in the pension and with the healthcare benefits. Get the people of the older generation. You can't get the younger ones to work. You're quite happy to pay for the welfare system of over $250 billion a year. Why don't you let the older Australians get up there and work? A lot of them would dearly love to be able to without being crucified and having to pay these ridiculous taxes that you always want to take from them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, as I said, I don't support your bill. I won't be supporting it. I support the fact that it's giving those tax cuts to the people, but, in full, you've lied to the Australian people. It was a promise made. You've taken that promise. But I will fight for the Australian people, if we get control of this Senate at the next election, to give those full tax cuts to all Australians.</span>

The Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024 provide meaningful, sustainable cost-of-living relief and will deliver substantial tax reform to the tax system. They will support the hardworking Australians who keep our economy and our country strong. I am looking forward to the debate in the committee stage. It is important that we get these bills passed, because our tax cuts mean every taxpayer, no matter what they earn, will get a tax cut. Eighty-four per cent of taxpayers will get a bigger tax cut, and that's more tax relief to help with cost-of-living pressures.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I rise today, compelled to share with you the harrowing story of a brave journalist who endured untold suffering at the hands of the government of Azerbaijan. This year I had the honour of meeting Mr Alexander Lapshin, an Israeli journalist. I heard firsthand the horrors he endured during his illegal imprisonment by Azerbaijan. The grim details included torture and even attempted murder, and for what crime exactly? It was because Mr Lapshin dared to visit the so-called disputed territory of Artsakh, currently completely occupied by Azerbaijan, and published articles critical of its authoritarian leader, Ilham Aliyev.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, Mr Lapshin's case is not isolated. There remain countless political prisoners, journalists and Armenian prisoners of war, including civilians and government authorities from the republic of Artsakh who have walked the halls of this parliament, who are being held captive on fabricated charges. The crimes even extend to the ethnic cleansing of over 100,000 Armenians from Artsakh in September 2023, after Azerbaijan launched an unprovoked military attack, forcing the entire indigenous Armenian population of Artsakh to leave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Azerbaijan is one of the most corrupt and aggressive nations in the world. As representatives of a democratic and free nation, it is our duty to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves, including the over 50,000 Armenian Australians who are rightfully outraged by the actions of this regime. I urge the Australian government to outright denounce the egregious violations of human rights of Azerbaijan and demand accountability of those responsible. We cannot turn a blind eye to the suffering of innocent individuals like Alexander Lapshin and ethnic Armenians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  It's been a particularly tough few months for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Hearing your life and your community frequently spoken of in terms of deficits and not strengths can take a toll on the mental health of so many First Nations people. Like many of us who are mob, I have seen firsthand the increase in harassment and hate speech online, especially the rise in racial abuse targeting First Nations people, and conversation in the media frequently speaks about the issues and challenges we as a community face but neglects to mention our community's successes. But First Nations Australians are proud and resilient people. Our people, history and culture have persisted for more than 65,000 years. It is the oldest continuous civilisation on earth.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state, the Gunditjmara people have developed and used environmental management strategies over thousands of years, working with the natural resources and environment of the Victorian south-west region to establish a permanent place for human society for over 30,000 years. Today, Winda-Mara's land management unit manages over 3,000 hectares of Aboriginal land across 10 sites, all of which are considered culturally significant to the local mob and are now under the Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I spent some time on Gunditjmara country with the team at Winda-Mara Aboriginal Corporation and the rangers caring for country at the Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape. Two of these rangers, sisters Lashay and Haylee Blurton, come from a line of incredible leaders who have served our nation. They are the great-granddaughters of Uncle Reg Saunders. Now they are serving their community and looking after country. Thank you for your commitment to the work.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a privilege to be able to meet with outstanding community members such as Lashay and Haylee. I hope every senator in this place can promote the story of a First Nations person or community that deserves recognition for selflessly dedicating their time and effort to go above and beyond for their community and for the nation. Together we can create a culture that celebrates First Nations excellence. When our mobs are thriving, the nation is thriving, and we are all better for it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  I'm humbled to soon be tabling in the Senate a petition with nearly 10,000 signatures that calls on the Australian government to save the family of Akram, a Palestinian-born Australian citizen who is trapped in Gaza. Akram and his family migrated to regional Victoria from Gaza in 2009, and he has been a devoted doctor to his local community ever since. He works in his local town's clinic and nursing home, while his wife runs a local restaurant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 7 October more than 28,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's attacks on Gaza, more than 100,000 have been injured and millions more have been displaced owing to this violence and devastation. With the Israeli government declaring a ground attack on Rafah, there's nowhere that is safe for Palestinians to go. Akram's family members' lives hang in the balance as they remain stuck at the Rafah border crossing, unable to escape. They have been displaced four times since losing their homes; their collective six houses were all bulldozed in the attacks, and now they're facing starvation, dehydration and disease, owing to a lack of clean water. But the Labor government have turned their back on Akram, his family and all other Palestinians living in Australia and in occupied Palestine, as they refuse to call for a permanent ceasefire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Silence in the face of atrocities is not an option. Australia has a responsibility to act to stop the crime of genocide and to support punishment for genocide wherever it occurs. I urge Labor to take this petition seriously and to expedite the visas of Akram's family. I also call on Labor to publicly back South Africa's proceedings against Israel in the International Court of Justice to sanction Prime Minister Netanyahu and his entire war cabinet, to end all military and security trade and cooperation with Israel, to restore and increase aid to UNRWA, and finally to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  The Order of Australia is a way of recognising the hard work and dedication that so many have provided to the service of our nation. Of those who were recognised in this year's honours, I would like to talk about two: Mrs Penelope Becchio OAM and Mrs Nasiba Akram-Haidari OAM, both from New South Wales. Penny is someone I have known well and come to call a friend through our shared time in the Liberal Party. A mother of three and a dedicated volunteer her whole life, Penny received a Medal of the Order of Australia in recognition of her services to the community through a range of organisations. Penny is the embodiment of service and selflessness. In addition to her service to the Liberal Party, she has also been involved with Scouts NSW for more than four decades and is currently serving as a state commissioner. She has volunteered with the Hornsby Gang Show for over 20 years. Penny has had a love of the arts, and since 2010 she has been a member of the Hornsby Art Prize Project committee. Penny is also a person of faith and has served her parish, St Patrick's Asquith, since the 1980s. I give her my heartfelt congratulations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another one of the exceptional Australians who were acknowledged at this year's awards was Nasiba Akram-Haidari. Nasiba has led an extraordinary life, and has dedicated it to the service of humanitarian causes. Nasiba and her husband fled the communist coup in Afghanistan during the late 1970s and came to Australia as political refugees. She went on to dedicate her life to the assistance of other Afghan refugees and refugee settlement services, including offering her home as a place of safety and shelter for hundreds across the past few decades. A foundation member and adviser for the Afghan Community Support Organisation of New South Wales, Nasiba has worked tirelessly for the benefit of her community. I congratulate her on her work. Thank you and congratulations to Penny and Nasiba.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  On Friday, delivery riders held another peaceful gathering outside the Sydney offices of the multinational gig platform HungryPanda. The organiser of the gathering, Zhuoying Wang, has worked for HungryPanda since 2019. She spoke about the retaliation she faced when she first started raising issues about fair pay and safety. Instead of sacking her, HungryPanda simply stopped giving her orders. After 100 hours logged in, she earned just $84—that's just 84 cents an hour for 100 hours. Since 4 February, she has received no orders at all. She can't earn any money, she can't pay her rent and her housemates are shouting her food.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a responsibility to make sure that migrants who are working here are entitled to fair pay and safety standards. The closing the loopholes act that we passed this month will mean gig workers finally have a pathway towards minimum standards. Many gig platforms supported the reforms, but cowboys like HungryPanda didn't see the writing on the wall and have slashed their base rate for deliveries from $7 to $4, a decrease of 42 per cent. They've introduced a bonus scheme where riders must complete a set number of orders in an unrealistic and unsafe time frame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Friday, Zhuoying said: 'Today is my 40th birthday, but it's not a beautiful birthday. I hope to take action to protect my legitimate rights.' Peter Dutton and the coalition stood with HungryPanda and voted against legislation to give minimum standards to riders like Zhuoying. But, while Zhuoying and her colleagues are standing up for their rights on the street, the Albanese Labor government is standing up for their rights in this place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  Tasmania is having a state election. It's the Liberal Party putting their jobs on the line this time. They're going to the election 18 months early—which, by the way, they did last time. Their campaign slogan was Vote For Stability—what a joke! Not least because they themselves got into minority government last year because two of their own were so disgusted by the lack of transparency that they left the Liberal Party. They've lost minister after minister, but they are quite comfortable telling Australians they're the only ones who can be trusted. The last two Liberal premiers promised they would serve a full term, and then both of them resigned mid-term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, we call freedom of information requests FOIs; in Tassie, we call them RTIs, right to information. Like the FOI system, Tasmania's RTI system is completely shattered. It is beyond broken. Tasmanians are more likely to have their right to information applications refused than any other Australian in this country. How's that for transparency? Both of the major parties love suggesting that voting for micros and Independents means instability. What they really mean is that they do not want transparency in Tasmania. They don't want anyone else to see the books, because quite frankly they're cooked. They don't want Tasmanians to know exactly how their tax dollars are being spent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By the way, the Labor Party is just as bad down in Tasmania. You wait for the next federal election. The Labor Party and the Liberal Party in this house will be all over the media gobbing off about how they're the only ones who know how to govern. They're just scared about sharing power. That's why they've done a deal on donation reform which is just disgraceful. They want to control how microparties and Independents get funding, while keeping their entities, their shelf companies, their election money laundering businesses, going on and on while micros and Independents pay the price. I reckon Tasmanians are sick of this rubbish, and I think they know, as I do, what the majors are up to in Australia. I tell you what: it's not working too well for you. Wake up, Australians and Tasmanians. You want some transparency? Let's get it going.</span>

Every time I go to Lismore, I'm struck by the resilience and the camaraderie that characterises this town and the spirit that they've all relied on to rebuild after the floods in 2022. This time I had the privilege of meeting members of the Lismore Lions Club. This is a group that was formed in 1947 just after the war, and it is a core and active participant in the community of Lismore. I rise to thank them for their dedicated efforts in helping the community rebuild after those devastating floods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are just a couple of examples of their contributions. Immediately following the floods, the Lions Club provided cooked meals for breakfasts and lunches for 34 days for those community members without access to a food supply or the ability to prepare food or cook for themselves. They provided fruit, water and snacks for the workers that were involved in the clean-up in the city, and they delivered sandwiches and water to those businesses in the industrial areas. But it became obvious to them that more was going to be needed and for a lot longer, and so they raised over $550,000 to assist people in re-establishing their homes. Their initial efforts provided beds, mattresses, fridges and washing machines, and they've expanded that support to include furniture, electrical equipment, fans and heater installations, and vouchers for household items and food purchases. They've collaborated with all of these other organisations across Lismore and are now receiving referrals from Resilient Lismore and the Lismore City Council recovery centre.</span>

Both the Labor and Liberal leaders have ruled out negotiating with the Greens if a power-sharing parliament is elected. Let's name this for what it is—Labor and Liberal politicians playing political games. People in Tasmania are rightfully sick of this kind of rubbish, political gameplaying. In total contrast, the Greens have said we will respect the will of the Tasmanian people and we will work constructively and collaboratively with whatever parliament the Tasmanian voters elect. Put the Greens in the balance of power, and we will push the next government to take action on climate change, to stop native forest logging, to make public transport free, to abolish public school levies, to stop the stadium at Macquarie Point, to cap skyrocketing rents, and much, much more.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A power-sharing parliament would be the best outcome for Tasmania on 23 March because it would mean that no political party has absolute power. It would mean every policy, every law and every decision has to be the result of a genuine effort to find common ground, to build consensus and to respect the diverse voices that make up the great state of Tasmania. A power-sharing parliament is government for grown-ups, and the Greens stand ready to respect the will of the Tasmanian voters. The challenge for Jeremy Rockliff and Rebecca White is to stop playing political games and make the same commitment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  In Australia, you cannot be discriminated against based on your race, your gender, your sexual orientation or your disability. That would be against the law. However, the law explicitly permits life insurers to discriminate against people based on their DNA. There are many reasons we should be concerned about this. But what has me worried is the impact it is having on people as they are deciding whether or not to get potentially lifesaving genetic testing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision on whether to have a genetic test is a deeply personal one. If you're looking at testing, it's probably because you have a loved one who has been diagnosed with cancer; breast cancer is the most well-known example. For those with a history of breast cancer, a clinician may recommend testing for a BRCA gene mutation. When this happens, it should be a matter for you and you alone. But, currently, you also have to consider the very real possibility that you may never be able to get life insurance coverage. For many people, this is enough to stop them from going ahead with the test. And that is a tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we don't want to lose the benefits that genetic testing could bring to our communities and our families, then we need to ban life insurers from collecting this information—no loopholes, no exemptions, a complete ban that provides certainty for people that their DNA can never, ever be used against them. We've seen this happen in Canada. There's an opportunity for the Labor government to make this change and give people certainty that, when they get a DNA test, that cannot be used against them by life insurers.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Today I want to shine a spotlight on an individual who embodies the spirit of dedication, community service and resilience: Nathan Conroy. Nathan has an incredible backstory. His journey is one of remarkable perseverance and commitment to public service. He's an Irishman who has chosen to make Australia his home. He married a local girl, Steffie, and they have a young son, Callan, and they've settled down in Frankston South, just around the corner from where she grew up. They are typical of many Australian families; they're working hard to pay their mortgage and they've got skyrocketing bills. They do that to ensure there is a bright future for their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nathan stood for council in 2020 because he wanted to change his community for the better. For three years in a row, Nathan has been selected by his peers to be mayor. They voted for him because they knew he had a plan for his community, and he's been able to deliver on that plan. He's demonstrated himself to be a leader in his community. He's delivered more infrastructure, better services and greater financial accountability for his council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nathan knows that the cost of living is the No. 1 issue for the people of Dunkley because he's spoken to thousands of residents—thousands of residents—whether it be out doorknocking, or on listening posts, or, in the last week and a half, on the early voting pre-poll. I've been out in Dunkley with him, and there is white-hot anger out there on the ground towards this Labor government for their wrong priorities and their broken promises, whether they be on groceries, electricity and gas or, now, on cars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nathan Conroy, as an alternative, has such a strong track record of fighting for the people of Frankston, and, if he's elected on Saturday, I know that he will also deliver for the people of Dunkley.</span>

Queensland's Supreme Court today determined that COVID-19 vaccine mandates imposed on police and health workers were unlawful.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland Police Service and Queensland Health were wrong to force mandates on their organisations. I said, from the start, these mandates were wrong. I said, from the start, they contravened section 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution, which prohibits civil conscription through the provision of medical services. One Nation was the only party saying it. I said, from the start, the mandates should be unlawful. I introduced legislation in this parliament that would have made certain they were unlawful. With a couple of notable exceptions, the government, the opposition, the Greens, Jacqui Lambie and other Independents, refused to support my bill. You all got it wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel vindicated, once again, that I have got things right and I'm in tune with the Australian people. You didn't care that people were being coerced into vaccination, at risk of their jobs. You didn't care that the individual freedoms and rights you were supposed to defend and protect were under attack. You relished the power that state governments were taking from their citizens. You cheered them on. You were wrong. One Nation was right, because we were standing up for the individual freedoms and constitutional authority that underpin Australian democracy. You didn't, and you attacked us for it. You were wrong.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision by Queensland's Supreme Court makes it paramount that we have a royal commission into the COVID-19 pandemic. The Prime Minister's toothless inquiry must be abandoned. Only a royal commission can compel the secret advice that led to these unlawful vaccine mandates in Queensland. And I feel for the firefighters that have gone through it as well in New South Wales and Victoria. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  Nurses are the bedrock of our community. They should not have to fight to be paid what they are worth. And they should not be forced to take on many shifts—double or triple shifts—to manage patient ratios that are at unsafe levels. The ratio of one nurse to four patients across all WA EDs has rightly been recommended. With the new WA nurses enterprise bargaining agreement including a phase-in of the one-to-four nurse-to-patient ratio, the WA state government needs to take action now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard from nurses that they feel that the WA government is letting them down—that maybe, sometime in the future, they'll get better staffing ratios. And don't get me started on the dismal three per cent pay rise—or nothing!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's refusal to pay nurses what they are worth and to properly fund our WA hospitals has had real effects on our healthcare system. It's the lack of wheelchairs in emergency departments to support people when they have broken their ankles. It's people experiencing six-hour wait times and hours and hours of ambulance ramping. It's the day-to-day anxiety that comes from being a nurse working a 12-hour shift and being responsible for far more patients than anyone could possibly manage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fixes aren't difficult. WA's surplus is hitting some $3.7 billion. It is beyond time for WA Labor to invest in our healthcare system so that it works for everyone.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  The recent blackouts experienced in Victoria are a stark example of the vulnerabilities of our power grid. These blackouts are further evidence that the government's Rewiring the Nation policy is a folly. It's a $100 billion taxpayer funded folly. Blackouts highlight the vulnerability of poles and wires to adverse weather conditions, which, as we know, are expected to worsen due to the intensifying effects of climate change. It is perplexing that the federal government remains committed to an approach that prioritises the expansion of a conventional transmission system despite the clear warning bells rung by this recent blackout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's strategy involves extending poles and wires across vast distances, across bushfire zones, across protected land and across prime agricultural land. Rewiring the Nation is a folly that has an enormous cost, no social licence and fails to contribute in any way to the power generation storage capabilities of the grid. This risky, expensive folly doesn't generate one electron and doesn't store even one kilowatt of power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time for this government to abandon this outdated project and adopt energy strategies that align more closely with Australia's unique environmental conditions and future energy needs. Imagine what $100 billion of taxpayer dollars could do if it were invested directly into households. Investing in rooftop solar, coupled with vehicle-to-grid EV technology could have an immediate result, lowering emissions and removing the need for poles and wires. If we need transmission, we could also look at providing underground DC cabling for higher efficiency and lower risk of fire. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Chris Evans sustained this program even while he was government leader in this place. The program connects young people of diverse backgrounds with the labour movement, bringing those people into the labour movement and connecting them with political leaders, unions and institutions. It's funded by donations from unions, labour organisations, parliamentarians, and individuals who really want to support the next generation of labour activists coming through.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It now has a community of some 150 politically active alumni, giving each new generation a rich understanding of the values and aspirations of the union movement and the Labor Party. It perhaps won't surprise you to know that way back in 1996, its inaugural year, I was a participant in the Chris Evans labour movement work experience project, as it was then known. At the time, it was coordinated by the current Western Australian Premier, Roger Cook. I credit my time in the program with giving me a strong foundation in the institutions, networks and political groupings to make my way into a political career. As the program nears its 30th year, I want to thank former senator Evans for his continuous dedication to education and advocacy for the union movement. I want to thank Di and this year's cohorts for the great work they've done, and on behalf of myself I also say thank you. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Whether you're a mine worker in Rocky or a cafe worker in Cairns, you will get a tax cut on 1 July because of the Labor government. We are putting more money back in the pockets of hardworking Australians. We will ensure that 85 per cent of regional Queenslanders see a boost under this proposal.</span>

We always take the advice of our security agencies on these matters. As you'd know, they go through a process in relation to this. I believe it also involves the joint standing committee on intelligence and security to some degree—or consultation. But that is the position the government takes. We take the objective of keeping Australians safe very seriously. We listen to our security agencies. We take their advice and, when we get that advice, we act on it. I would expect that that would be the way that you would have operated in government as well.</span>

This comes after the Department of Home Affairs revealed at Senate estimates that, while the government has allocated funding to combat Islamophobia, there is no equivalent program to address antisemitism. Will the government commit to taking urgent action to address the crisis of antisemitism in Australia and support our Jewish communities at their time of greatest need?</span>

The government condemns antisemitism and Islamophobia and we have been doing everything that we can, particularly with heightened tensions in the Middle East, to make sure that we are doing whatever we can to keep communities safe and to keep the community united. And that is, I think, something that we have taken very seriously. We understand there has been an increase in antisemitism in this country. We oppose it. We reject it. We do stand with the Jewish community across Australia. We also understand that, because of the tensions in the Middle East, Muslim Australians and Australians from Palestine have also been experiencing increased tension and Islamophobia. And, again, I would say— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Today the Albanese government delivered on an election promise and published the individual gender pay gaps of Australia's largest employers. This step builds on the government's commitment to close the gender pay gap and to lift women's economic equality. Could the minister outline the findings of today's landmark data release and how shining a light helps to shift the dial when it comes to closing the gender pay gap?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Finance, Minister for Women, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:04</span>):  I thank Senator Marielle Smith for her question and for the incredible job she does on behalf of the people of South Australia and when it comes to gender equality and advocating for policies that support gender equality. I would also like to acknowledge Ms Mary Wooldridge in the chamber today and her team from WGEA for the hard work that they've done to get us to this point today. I would like to acknowledge the effort that has gone into raising awareness and publicity of this important release today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">WGEA first published national gender pay gap data in 2014, and it is fitting that, 10 years later, we've reached the point of publishing employer-level data. Publishing the gender pay gaps of big employers was a commitment we took to the last election, as Senator Smith outlined. We brought that reform to the parliament a year ago, and now today we're taking the crucial step towards fairness in Australian workplaces. This is an Australian first, and there are a lot of takeaways from the data released today. We can see a median gender pay gap of 19 per cent when it comes to total remuneration, and that's equivalent to over $18,000 per year. Thirty per cent of Australian employers have a gender pay gap of within five per cent of zero, which is very promising, but around two-thirds of employers, just over 60 per cent, have a gender pay gap above that, which means the majority of Australian workplaces have work to do to close their gender pay gap.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In every industry in Australia, the median of what a woman is paid is less than the median of what a man is paid. By exposing these pay gaps, sharing this data and shining some light on it, we're giving power to both employees and employers to drive real change.</span>

The data today shows that the median gender pay gap is equivalent to just over $18,000 a year. If you're a woman working in a male dominated industry, the median pay gap is over $27,000, and if you work in construction the median gap is over $38,000. With this data, businesses and workers are armed with powerful information about where employers need to focus their efforts. They may focus on recruitment and promotion or addressing industry and occupation gender segregation, which is a big problem in this country. They may also look at workplace flexibility and the structure of bonuses. The government looks forward to continuing to work with businesses and WGEA to make sure we are closing the gender pay gap. At the pace we're going now, it'll take another quarter of a century to close that gap, and we think that is too long.</span>

That is the Prime Minister's focus, and that is the Minister for Indigenous Affairs' focus.

The Prime Minister has made it clear that the work we are doing in government is to deal with closing the gap in those priority areas that we are focused on and that the Minister for Indigenous Affairs is leading, ably supported by every single one of us in this caucus who wants to make a difference and close the gap, not talk about everything else.</span>

Today's release of employer-level gender pay gap data by the excellent WGEA is a move that the Greens have long called for, but the results are shocking. Employers should be embarrassed into fixing their gender pay gap, but there is a role for government here too. Many of the employers today reporting enormous gender pay gaps receive large government grants. For example, climate wrecker Santos has a median gender pay gap of 24.7 per cent. In 2021, the government awarded Santos a $16½ million grant for its Moomba carbon capture and storage project. Minister, how many of the companies reporting a gender pay gap today receive government grants, and will the government stop subsidising discrimination by not giving grants to employers with gender pay gaps?</span>

I also acknowledge the work that she's done around gender equality more broadly, and the advocacy that she has made for many years in this area. In terms of Senator Waters' questions, the focus of the release of this data today has not been to name and shame—to individually single out particular businesses. It's to shine a light.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coverage, interest and discussions we've had today totally endorse the approach we've taken, which is that raising awareness will force the change to happen. Companies will be wanting to know why these gaps exist and what they can do about it and to generate the change that needs to happen. That is why we've released these reports—to link it to government grants. There are currently arrangements that exist through our procurement processes to ensure that, if companies don't engage with WGEA, they don't have access to government work over a certain limit. The issue, more broadly, about procurement is something that is before me more generally, to look at ways that we can support ethical procurement through our government processes. We are a big purchaser of supplies and services, and it's only right that we should be looking at all aspects of that to make sure that government is showing leadership in this area.</span>

Again, I think it's endorsing the approach that publishing this data is generating the conversations that will drive the change. We have not used the data from WGEA, nor were businesses who engaged with this willingly told that this data would then be used to stop something else. This is about reporting the current situation as it is and encouraging change. Part of those changes, which this parliament supported, was that reports need to be provided to the board, for example, so that the board is aware of what's happening in the business's operations. On the issue of procurement more generally, as I said in my first answer, I am working with Finance on this issue, through the Buy Australian plan and other work that we're doing to make sure that government, as a purchaser, is leading the way in delivering good, strong social and ethical outcomes.</span>

I was going to say that there isn't a subject or topic that the Greens can't somehow link to political donations in this country, despite not being able to provide any evidence at all, other than trying to besmirch political opponents. So let's just see this for what it is. If I take the issue of financial services seriously, when looking at gender pay gaps in financial services there are some financial services that have managed to have a neutral gender pay gap. There are others that have a large gender pay gap. The issue around this data is that by publishing it we've been able to identify that, and hopefully those companies where there are large gender pay gaps in favour of men will take the steps that they need to take to close that gender pay gap and to close it faster than has been occurring in previous years.</span>

The Albanese Labor government understands the importance of homeownership and the unique challenges in our regions, which is why we took to the election a commitment to establish a Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee to support eligible regional Australians to buy a home with as little as five per cent deposit. And I know the Liberals and the Nationals hate hearing about a Labor government delivering to the regions—they hate it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This commitment from Labor was delivered three months ahead of schedule. The Albanese Labor government has also expanded eligibility for the Home Guarantee Scheme to help more Australians into homeownership. Since July last year the First Home Guarantee and the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee have been open to joint applications with friends and family members, not just single, married or de facto applicants. The Family Home Guarantee has been expanded from single, natural or adoptive parents with dependants to include eligible borrowers who are single legal guardians of children, such as aunts, uncles and grandparents.</span>

I'm pleased to say that Labor's Help to Buy shared-equity program will provide a pathway to homeownership for people who have been locked out. Eligible participants will need only a two per cent deposit for Help to Buy, and the government will support them with an equity stake of up to 40 per cent for new homes and up to 30 per cent for existing homes. In Tasmania this could mean assistance of up to $240,000 on a new home in Hobart and similar amounts around the state.</span>

Labor wants to help young Australians buy just one home. The Greens should stop voting with Peter Dutton to block more housing.</span>

But one major housing challenge I didn't expect was the constant politicking from the Greens political party. They have opposed or delayed every single housing measure that we have introduced and criticised every dollar we have invested in affordable housing. The Greens talk a big game about housing, while they lead protests around the country to stop the construction of more than 3,200 homes right across the country. The Greens party say they want us to help renters buy a home, but now they block Labor's proposal that is literally called 'Help to Buy'. In a recent bubbling interview on the ABC program <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span>, their housing spokesperson said, 'We have more than enough homes for people to live in,' despite experts consistently calling for more supply. So now we know why the Greens keep voting with Mr Dutton to block Labor's plans to build homes: they think we have more than enough homes already. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  My question is for the Minister for Finance. Between January 2018 and 30 June 2021 the ANAO reported that the Commonwealth issued some $60.2 billion worth of grants. During this time we saw taxpayer money go to project after project based not on the needs of the community but on purely political marginal seat calculations that saw Canberra miss out time and again—from commuter car parks to sports rorts. Does the government believe that legislation is needed to put an end to pork-barrelling?</span>

I think there should be transparency around those decisions. It is currently a function that falls within the Department of Finance. I've been working with my department on looking at ways to strengthen the Commonwealth grants framework, including enhancements to those rules and guidelines, and I'll have more to say about that soon, when that work is complete.</span>

Given we saw all the things that you pointed to when there were guidelines and all the rest, in August 2021, you introduced the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Amendment (Improved Grants Reporting) Bill 2021 to end pork-barrelling. Now we have Dr Haines with her own bill. Will you be supporting Dr Haines's bill to end pork-barrelling in Australia?</span>

I have answered that question about the approach that I'm taking. The bill I introduced when I was in opposition was around the reporting of when ministers make decisions about the awarding of grants in their own areas or their own electorates and the fact that that had quite a long delay in terms of that information becoming public. I have a view we should be providing more frequent reports around that. But tightening up the grants guidelines and the grants framework, working with the JCPAA, which has done quite a lot of work in this regard, and with the work the ANAO has done through its recommendations, is certainly the way through. I'm doing that work, and I'll have more to say about it shortly.</span>

I've already said in response to my previous answer that I believe more frequent reporting when ministers are the decision-makers in their own electorates is important; that is a key part of the transparency approach. But I also believe that modernising the grants framework and the guidelines in accordance with the work that this parliament has done through the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and the ANAO is also a meritorious way forward, and that's the approach I've taken. I have been working on this for some time now. We engage with a lot of grants programs, many of which are ongoing, and we don't support pork-barrelling. There are ways to improve the current arrangements.</span>

I appreciate you having contacted me directly about this issue in general. You understand, I'm sure, like all of us, that it is vital that a country like Australia maintains strong biosecurity protections. It was only shortly after our government came to office that we faced the risk of foot-and-mouth disease entering Australia, lumpy skin disease and many other biosecurity threats. It's only through the hard work of our biosecurity officers in airports, ports and elsewhere around the country, as well as through the great efforts of farmers and others in rural Australia, that we're kept safe from various diseases.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to office I was pretty horrified to learn that the former government had not built in long-term ongoing funding of our biosecurity protections; in fact, the funding for biosecurity was on track to fall by, from memory, around 25 per cent despite the fact that those threats were increasing. So what the government did at the last budget was to significantly increase taxpayer funding for biosecurity protections and dramatically increase the charges that we were placing on importers for the biosecurity services that we provide—something the former government had never been prepared to do. The former government said that we needed stronger biosecurity and were not prepared to make importers pay the full cost of those services.</span>

Recommendation 35 from Dr Wendy Craik's report <span style="font-style:italic;">Priorities </span><span style="font-style:italic;">for Australia's biosecurity system</span> calls for an industry stocktake of national biosecurity system investment and for the results to be made public. Can the minister justify the new levy without having conducted a formal stocktake of the industry's contributions, and will the government commit to implementing that recommendation?</span>

Certainly I'm aware that the department of agriculture has undertaken a large amount of work in the biosecurity protection space since that report was delivered by Ms Craik to the former government several years ago. I would be confident that the work that addresses that recommendation has been done, but I'm obviously happy to go back and have a look at that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we established in the work leading up to the budget was that we did need to lock in ongoing, year-by-year funding for biosecurity in a way that the former government was never prepared to do, so we could have that certainty around biosecurity funding, and that the cost of providing those services should be shared by the taxpayer generally, by importers and by asking producers to make a small contribution to the cost of those services. As I said, the overall cost that we will recoup from producers is about $50 million in a budget of several hundred million dollars.</span>

Again, this issue around a container levy goes back to that report that was delivered by Ms Craik several years ago to the former government. You may remember that at one point the former government promised to introduce a container levy and then they decided it was all too hard and they scrapped it. I notice that now they're promising to bring in a container levy, even though they weren't prepared to do it when they were in office.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've done instead is to focus on the charges that we know we are legally authorised to charge importers by making them pay the full cost of the biosecurity services that we provide. We are continuing to examine a container levy, but, as I've previously indicated, there are some World Trade Organization legal issues that we need to work through to ensure that we can charge a container levy. As soon as that work is completed, I'll of course update the chamber.</span>

A new $20 million cadet facility in Launceston was promised under the 2017 Launceston City Deal, but seven years later there's still nothing to show for it—no dirt turned and no tender put out—just crickets. Years of conversations between the Department of Defence, the Tasmanian Liberal government and UTAS show them chasing their tails to complete the necessary land transfer for the project to get underway. With UTAS being uncooperative and causing delays, the Department of Defence put a deadline of 29 February 2024, which is this Thursday, on the land transfer in a bid to get the project moving at last. Minister, can you confirm that the land transfer will be completed by this Thursday?</span>

As you're probably aware, Senator Tyrrell, under the Launceston City Deal, Defence committed to the divestment of Paterson Barracks, with the intention that a new cadet facility could be established within the University of Tasmania Newnham Campus. Defence could not complete the planned settlement by 22 July owing to land title issues to be resolved between the Tasmanian government and the University of Tasmania. Defence has committed resources in the expectation of land being available for development. Defence plans to tender the works package for the facility following completion of land acquisition activities. As you have indicated, Senator Tyrrell, that process is still underway.</span>

Senator Tyrrell, as you would appreciate, not ordinarily being the minister representing, I'm not really across the finer details of this proposal. I'm happy to get some further information for you. From everything I have just said it would suggest that it may be difficult to meet the time line that you're talking about, but Defence is absolutely committed to this project going ahead and will continue to work closely with all parties to progress its commitment to the City Deal, including the divestment of Paterson Barracks.</span>

As you would have heard in my answer to the previous question, there can be no doubting Defence's commitment to this project going ahead, and a very large amount of work has been put in place to ensure that it can go ahead. I'm certainly not aware from the briefing material I have received that Defence has any intention of walking away from this project. As I indicated in my previous answer, Defence remains fully committed to this project going ahead.</span>

They're not entirely within Defence's remit to sort them out and to get this project happening, but Defence is working closely and will continue to work closely with those partners to ensure that the project goes ahead.</span>

Again, I have certainly seen nothing come before me that would suggest that this is entirely the responsibility of UTAS. I don't have the background to this project to know whether that's the case or not, and I'm certainly not aware of any plan to impose some kind of penalty on UTAS in relation to this project not having yet commenced. All I can say is that the Department of Defence and the government as a whole remain committed to the project going ahead. We call on the Tasmanian government and UTAS to resolve these issues and we stand ready to assist in any way that we can.</span>

From 1 July the Albanese Labor government is delivering a tax cut to every Australian taxpayer which is designed to help address the continued cost-of-living pressures Australians are facing. This will mean that working Australians will keep more of what they earn. Why is it important that the government's plan is delivered and how will it provide tangible relief to Australian households who are doing it tough?</span>

From 1 July this year, the Albanese Labor government will deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer—13.9 million people. Our tax cuts will deliver a bigger tax cut for Middle Australia to help ease the cost of living. The Albanese government is responding to the pressures that Australians are under here and now. Under our plan, more Australians will get a tax cut and more Australians will get a bigger tax cut.</span>

And 140,000 Tasmanian women will get a tax cut, and 130,000 of these women will get a bigger tax cut than they would have under the former government's proposal.</span>

A person on an average income of around $73,000 will get a tax cut of $1,504—$804 more than they were going to get under the Liberal and National plan. A person earning $40,000 will get a tax cut of $654, compared with nothing under the Liberal and National plan. And a person earning $100,000 will get a tax cut of $2,179—$804 more than they would have received under those opposite. For a family on an average household income, they will receive $2,600, which is about $50 per week and $1,600 more than they would have received under the old plan. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In regional Victoria, 87 per cent of taxpayers will get a bigger tax cut. The vitally important workers of nurses, teachers, retail assistants, labourers, truckies and agricultural workers that live in regional Australia are some of the most likely to benefit. We recognise the contribution of these workers to our nation and to their local communities. Around 1.2 million people in Western Australia will get a bigger tax cut on 1 July under Labor's new tax cuts plan than under the former government's. Around 100,000 people in the NT will get a bigger tax cut on 1 July. I'm going to run out of time, but I've got more to come. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The auto industry released modelling to show Labor's family car tax on SUVs, four-wheel drives and utes could impose penalties of up to $25,000 on the cost of a new car. For example, the RAV4 would be slugged up to $11,000 under Labor's car tax, and the Ford Ranger ute by nearly $18,000. During the middle of a cost-of-living crisis and high inflation, why is the government trying to force Australians who want or need an SUV or a four-wheel drive to pay more when buying their next family car?</span>

What I would say is that Australia stands alone. We've been left by 10 years of inaction from your government, despite people supporting it. What's the other developed country that doesn't have fuel efficiency standards? Which is it? Oh, it's a country led by Vladimir Putin—Russia!</span>

What does the National Party have against more efficiency and lower costs for people when running their cars? They're currently paying too much, and they shouldn't be. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  This is about putting in place a new vehicle standard that will allow Australians to have more choice and pay less for fuel. And Toyota has announced they're launching a new, fully-electric SUV—there we go!—the bZ4X, today. We welcome more choice for Australian consumers. Of course, if you want a petrol SUV, you will still be able to buy one. And we will continue working on the case, with a fuel efficiency standard.</span>

For once, act in the interests of consumers in this country about getting access to choice, driving better vehicles into this country, encouraging greater fuel efficiency and lowering costs for drivers in this country. You should be getting behind this standard, just like Mr Fletcher, Senator Sharma and your former Treasurer, Mr Frydenberg. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's a business that I know Senator Chisholm, as well, is very familiar with, in my state of Queensland. An entry-level worker on the Bundaberg production line or in the brewhouse or in the warehouse—the people who make the magic happen—makes around $50,000 a year. With Labor's tax cuts, a worker at that plant will be $955 a year better off. Those opposite have been happy to accuse the government of stifling ambition, not believing in aspiration and discouraging workers from improving their lot in life. If that worker at Bundaberg gains the experience to get an even higher paid job at $65,000 a year, they will be over $1,300 a year better off as a result of Labor's tax cuts.</span>

As we've indicated repeatedly, Labor stands for manufacturing workers and all workers to earn more and keep more of what they earn. I'm very pleased to inform Senator Pratt that it isn't just food and beverage manufacturing workers who will benefit from Labor's tax cuts; it is all manufacturing workers in my state of Queensland, in Senator Pratt's state of Western Australia and everywhere else around Australia.</span>

A full-time entry-level production worker at the Capral plant currently makes around $52,000 a year. They will enjoy more than $1,000 from Labor's tax cuts. With a pay rise through gaining extra expertise and earning up to $73,000, they will get more than $1,500 a year from Labor's tax cuts. Our tax cuts are good for workers in manufacturing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That is changing under the Labor Party. Manufacturing workers are finally getting the respect they deserve, and now they will be better off thanks to Labor's tax cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that isn't all that we've been doing in this space since coming to government. Across the manufacturing industry, workers have been earning more since Labor came to government. The average full-time earnings for manufacturing workers since Labor came to office are up by $145 a week. There are also more manufacturing workers since Labor came to power—more than 85,000 additional secure, well-paid jobs in manufacturing, many of them in outer-suburban and regional communities. Thanks to Labor's tax cuts, a worker earning the average full-time manufacturing wage will be nearly $1,900 better off. Under Labor you'll earn more and keep more of what you earn. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, we heard about a deferral and an avoiding of the reality when it comes to fuel efficiency standards and EVs and a ute tax and SUV tax that is going to be placed upon Australian households. There's a real detachment from reality when it comes to this debate. We all can accept that things are changing in innovation and opportunity for vehicles, but the time frames that this government is putting in place are going to have a dramatic impact on households and on various industries. Senator Watt, in response to a question that he received, talked about the manufacturing industry. Well, I want to talk about a part of the manufacturing sector here in Australia that is going to be severely impacted by this change that the government is bringing into place and the haste with which it is doing it, and that is the caravan-manufacturing industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Did you know that over 90 per cent of the caravans that we all see driving on the roads—and sometimes holding up the traffic in the school holidays, heading up north or wherever they might be going—are manufactured here in Australia? In fact, 92 per cent are manufactured in Victoria alone, in the suburbs of Campbellfield and Epping. The policy that the government has is going to have a dramatic impact on that industry. It is shocking. That industry is worth, to rural Australia, over $11 billion in visitors who visit regional Australia with their caravans. When you hook up your caravan, you don't just go down the road to stay in your capital city. People from the country might do that when they come to visit family or others, but most of the people live in the capital cities, and they spend their holidays out in the regions. They hook up their van and they drive a distance to go to that holiday spot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know that an EV is not able to deal with those distances. Why is this? Because the gravimetric energy density of a battery—the best generation of lithium ion batteries—is 250 watt-hours per kilogram, whereas the gravimetric energy density of fuel is 11,700 watt-hours per kilogram. That means that a large vehicle like the F-150 Lightning, a big American truck, is failing in its sales overseas, because people realise that it's actually not that practical if you've got to carry something heavy. They're not selling those vehicles, and Ford are having to scale back their delivery of those vehicles. The battery in that vehicle alone weighs 900 kilos. That is equivalent to 18 litres of fuel. With 18 litres of fuel, you can get about 100 kilometres when you're towing something. That's the reality of the real-world tests that have been conducted, particularly in America, where these vehicles are currently available. You can tow for only 100 kilometres. If you're going from Perth to Busselton, it's normally only about a two-hour drive, but you would need to pull over twice over that distance and wait for three hours for your vehicle to recharge. And that is if the facility has a fast charger. You'd have to wait, because it's a 120-kilowatt-hour battery in that EV. It is simply not practical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not against EVs. My wife has one. It's fantastic. She drives around town. It's a small vehicle—perfect. But anyone who needs to tow something or who needs to put some heavy weight in the back, because that's their job, is going to find that these vehicles are impractical. The problem with this policy that the government is introducing is that it's putting a tax on people's lifestyles and a tax on people's jobs. That is the worst thing that you could do for productivity—putting a tax. The reason a tradie will carry, for example, a heavy jackhammer is that they've got to get through some heavy concrete. You're talking about the laws of physics here. You cannot defy them with mystical policies that you might bring in. You've got to deal with practicalities when it comes to this policy, and you are not doing that. It's all about the pace that you're going about it, because there is nothing—I defy anyone who wants to disagree with me: point to anything, even on the far periphery of any innovation—when it comes to battery technology or the storage of electricity in a vehicle that will demonstrate that it will go anywhere near the time frames that your policy is going to implement.</span>

I have to remind the Senate and the senators in this place about the car industry that used to exist in Australia. We have senators who make contributions on this point where they keep forgetting the fact that, when Joe Hockey was Treasurer, he rejoiced in the fact that Ford, Holden and Toyota shut up shop in this country, and we saw close to 200,000 jobs connected to the car industry go out the door and offshore.</span>

                  </a>  It was a good one. The point here is that, if we had a car industry in Australia today, cars would today be much cheaper than they are currently. We have to import cars because those opposite decided that, as a matter of policy, the government was no longer going to support a local car industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If my memory serves me correctly, Australia is the only country in the OECD that does not have some form of car industry. Every other country does. It is quite embarrassing that we do not have the ability in this country to make things here, particularly cars. It wasn't just about the motor vehicles that were made here. It was also about all the indirect jobs resulting from making motor vehicles. We had a bunch of engineering jobs that were connected through our TAFEs and universities. There were a number of boilermakers. I know this because my dad used to be a boilermaker; he worked for Ford for many years. My grandad worked for General Motors from when he first came to Australia up until the day he retired, 45 years later. And General Motors went overnight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were all of those other components in the supply chain that a number of small manufacturers contributed, not just to motor vehicle making here in Australia but to other sectors in the economy that they fed into. So we had this knock-on effect. As I said, there were around 200,000 jobs that simply went overnight as a result of the closure of the industry. They were worth around $29 billion to the Australian economy back then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to remind everyone—the people here in the gallery and those that are watching—about the Liberal Party's legacy when it comes to manufacturing, particularly in the automotive sector, because we also want to look at where we see ourselves in the future. It is important that there are greater investments, whether they be in hydrogen, electric or hybrid-style vehicles. All of these are part of the market that we now live in. The automotive industry is one that's very dynamic at the moment. It is interested in looking at new technologies and looking at ways of reducing the cost of new vehicles in this country to ensure that we do have better standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who would object to having better standards in the future? It would be the same debate that we would have had several decades ago around seatbelts. There would have been people who said, 'It is my right not to wear a seatbelt,' but—guess what—we now have standards that say that you have to wear a seatbelt for safety reasons. In the same way, we're trying to adopt better fuel standards that are currently being met around the world. But, for some reason, there are people here in this country and in this parliament that still want to live back in the old ages. They need to get a reality check and understand that, to move forward as a nation, as an economy, we need to also adapt to what is actually happening around us outside of our own little bubble.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rest of the world has already moved on. They are already using what we call premium petrol 95 as their standard. As a result, fuel efficiency is helping to make a contribution towards lowering our emissions here in Australia. I just wanted to make that point and place on the record that, when we look at how many jobs have been lost in the car industry, it is those opposite that should be blamed. They now have the audacity to come into this place and tell us that somehow we're getting it wrong by actually helping Australians access affordable, cleaner vehicles with greater standards in this country.</span>

                  <a href="306168" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KOVACIC</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  I rise to take note of answers to all coalition questions. I'm not sure where to begin. There are a couple of really important ones here. I'll start with Senator Chandler's question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Gallagher, around Leila Khaled. I note that the minister said that it is a priority for this government to keep the community safe and united. Well, we haven't really seen that. We haven't seen it with what has transpired in relation to the events of 7 October, and we haven't seen it with the rise of antisemitism in this country. That is a significant concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Green Left and the Socialist Alliance are the host of this annual Ecosocialism conference in Perth where this pro-Palestinian terrorist is expected to speak. Whilst the comment from the minister was that there isn't any awareness of it, it would be important for us to have very clear answers saying that if an application is made then the application will be rejected, because we don't want somebody in this country who spreads this kind of messaging. I think it is important to reinforce that publicly and to reinforce it in a manner that leaves no question whatsoever as to the position of this government on antisemitic materials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next one is in relation to Senator Price's questions regarding white privilege. A number of times the Minister representing the Prime Minister noted that the government accepts the outcome of the Voice referendum. However, that was not the question that was asked. The question that was asked, multiple times, was: does the Prime Minister agree with Labor's candidate in the seat of Dunkley that the referendum was a display of the worst white privilege in the country? So it's not around whether you accept the outcome; it's about whether the leadership of the government agrees with the candidate in Dunkley that the referendum result was the worst of white privilege in our country, particularly when we note that some 56,000 people who live in Dunkley and who voted in Dunkley in the referendum will also be voting in the by-election, and the Labor candidate has labelled the exercise of their vote, their democratic vote, as the worst of white privilege in our country. That's a real concern. I do note that the minister made the comment that it is an excellent candidate that they have in Dunkley, whose focus is jobs, housing and education. I'm just concerned about why the most public commentary was in relation to the Voice referendum result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I come to the questions from Senator McKenzie in relation to the new car tax. Last week I had the privilege of being in Parramatta, in Western Sydney, with our candidate for Parramatta, Katie Mullens, and our leader, Peter Dutton, speaking to motor dealers in relation to this issue. One of the consistent messages we received was that there is an understanding that there is a need to reduce emissions—this is important—but the issue is that the time line and the way in which this government is addressing this issue is not appropriate for the problem. Having this rolled out within the next 10 months, on 1 January 2025, is just too fast. One of the impacts, according to the motor industry, is that it will keep people in their cars for longer. They gave the example of New Zealand, where the current average age of a motor vehicle is 15 years. In Australia it's under 10 years. This new motor vehicle tax will keep people in older cars for longer periods, and those cars are higher-emitting vehicles than something that perhaps is produced today. This is an unintended consequence of this new car tax, notwithstanding the issues that my colleague spoke about earlier around the fact that a lot of these cars are going to cost a lot more money. And you don't have a choice to pick a different car. You can't have an electric ute hauling a bunch of building materials, because it just can't get there.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  Once upon a time—a very, very long time ago—when the National Party was probably just a twinkle in the eye, a grand new development came along, an exciting development that terrified much of the world. And that great development was the automobile. At the time, people were concerned and alarmed: 'How on earth could I possibly get my harvest to the market in that thing? It just won't work! The petrol won't take it far enough. The roads are all made of dirt. Oh my goodness! We can't do this. This is going to ruin how we live our lives. The world will end. What about the horses? Who's going to protect the horses?' Come on. Why don't we just get over this and realise that this is about technological development? This is about the future. This is about looking towards how things are changing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a situation where we are one of the last countries in the world without meaningful standards in this arena. What does that mean? It means that the dirtier cars in the world are being dumped on our doorstep. That is what we are being left with, because we are behind. We have fallen far behind. Look at the United States. They have had vehicle standards for 50 years, and we are standing here, listening to the Liberal Party and the National Party talk about how this is going to end something. That's their favourite line, whether we're ending the weekend or we're ending the future of gas guzzlers, which obviously are their favourite option here. This is about more choice. This is about driving towards a cheaper way of driving your car, but it is an option.</span>

                  </a>  It's so tempting, though, right? In summary, we don't want to be the dumping ground for inefficient cars in this country. We have a vision for the future, and we have a vision which leaves people with more choices. We are taking these standards forward—in a proper consultation, can I add, where we have had great engagement with a number of vehicle manufacturers who are keen, very supportive and right behind exactly what it is that we are trying to achieve here. I think it just leaves those opposite to get on board and stop the scaremongering. The automobile, when it was introduced, did not bring an end to the horse. The automobile, when it was introduced, developed many, many times, over and over again, and that is exactly what it is doing again here now. We are looking to the future, and we will have cleaner vehicles, more choices for motorists and a better future for Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="264449" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  I likewise rise today to take note of the responses provided to coalition questions during question time. Often, when standing up to take note in these debates, particularly now that we are in opposition, we really have justified why the hour from 2 pm to 3 pm each day is called 'question time' and not 'answer time', because time and again the opposition comes into this place asking questions of the government—important questions, questions that in many cases have been relayed to us by constituents back at home, by stakeholders and by communities across this country—and time and again there is no response from the government. There is no clear answer; there is equivocation, there is spin, and there is absolutely no substance to what this government is trying to achieve on behalf of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We did have a wide-ranging list of questions here today. My colleagues Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Kovacic have gone through some of these issues, but whether we're talking about the granting of visas, border security, national security or keeping Australian communities safe, whether it's this government and its uncanny ability to wink to the radical Left in this country or it's taxing the family car, this government has its priorities absolutely wrong. It is all spin and no substance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on just a few issues in my contribution in the chamber here this afternoon that were raised during question time. The first one is the government's failure to keep the community safe in this country and to take truly seriously some of the concerns we are currently seeing play out across the country. The concern that I particularly have is the government's failure to take the rise of antisemitism seriously. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of weeks ago my colleagues on the legal and constitutional affairs Senate estimates committee Senator Paterson and Senator Scarr asked some very pertinent questions of the Department of Home Affairs, questioning why the government have developed a specific package of support that is going to deal with Islamophobia in Australia but haven't developed a similar program to tackle antisemitism. My colleagues point out that there is a crisis of antisemitism in this country, and we know that this the case because it is being borne out by statistics on the reporting of prejudice motivated crimes. But when my colleagues Senator Paterson and Senator Scarr asked these questions in Senate estimates, when they put questions to the Department of Home Affairs, asking them why they hadn't done more to tackle antisemitism, they said, 'I will take that on notice.' I think many of the senators on this side of the chamber are getting progressively sicker and sicker of hearing that at Senate estimates. Yes, we recognise it is the right of bureaucrats and of ministers to take questions on notice, but it does get very frustrating when we are bringing important issues to Senate estimates and, indeed, into question time, and ministers are taking questions on notice and are not providing fulsome responses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw that again today in a conversation we had about Labor's new tax on family cars—and I find it interesting that other Labor senators want to come in here and talk about ancient history. They want to talk about what governments past have done, but they don't actually want to come in and talk about the fact that under the new proposal by the Albanese government the family car is going to cost significantly more. This is going to impact really badly on individuals, households and businesses across Australia that are buying big cars. We know that this tax means it's going to cost more than $11,000 more for a Toyota RAV4, more than $12,000 more for an MG ZS, and more than $25,000 more for a Toyota Land Cruiser. When I'm driving up the Midland Highway in Tassie, I see quite a few land cruisers on the road, and it absolutely staggers me that they are going to be $25,000 more expensive under this Labor government. But you wouldn't hear that from the Labor senators' contributions during take note of answers. You wouldn't hear that in the response from any ministers to questions asked by the coalition today because, as I said at the start of this contribution, this government are all spin. They are zero substance. They come here every day and refuse to actually engage in the issues that are important to all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:29</span>):  I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Gallagher) to a question without notice I asked today relating to the gender pay gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People might know that today, for the first time, we've had the release of employer-level gender pay gap data. It's the first time that the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, which has been doing marvellous work for about 10 years, has been able to release this employer-level data. We welcome that, because the Greens have called for that for quite some time. It will also enable workers to have a check on what the gender pay gap is in their particular workplace. Importantly, it will enable consumers to have a think about whether they still want to keep buying that particular brand or keep somehow giving money to that particular organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is welcome information, but it isn't simply up to business to fix the gender pay gaps that they identify in their own workplaces. There is a role for government here too. So I asked the minister: what is the government going to do about the fact that many of these companies that have very large gender pay gaps get government grants or get government contracts? I also asked the minister—although, unfortunately, she didn't take that bit on notice, but I'm still after the answer—how many companies with a large gender pay gap, or any gender pay gap, are in receipt of Commonwealth contracts or Commonwealth grants. I'd still like to know the answers to those questions. We know a few from our own basic research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should really analyse its own books, because, as the minister outlined for me, there is a procurement policy. I did read that earlier today, and, unfortunately, the procurement policy simply says that companies have to report on their gender pay gap in order to be eligible for grants or contracts. It doesn't say they've got to do anything to fix their gender pay gap. That's not good enough. The government needs to be part of driving change. The government needs to be part of ending the gender pay gap, and part of the way it can do that is by using its buying power—its procurement policies. The government should not be subsidising discrimination by giving government contracts or government grants of public money to companies that have a gender pay gap. It's as simple as that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I asked the minister whether the government would do those things, I didn't really get a very clear response. As an eternal optimist, I remain hopeful. I believe the minister did say that she has those procurement guidelines or some review of them before her at the minute, so I would urge her to make sure that the scope of that review does countenance looking at the gender pay gap of companies and making sure that they're not eligible to apply for Commonwealth grants or for Commonwealth contracts until they start taking steps towards fixing, or ideally fix, their gender pay gap. Again, I live in hope, and, with the minister in the chamber, I thought it worth reiterating both that we still want those details and that we would like the government to take these concerns seriously and do more to help close the gender pay gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister did say that she is hopeful that employers will take steps to close it. We're all hopeful, but it is not enough. One of the flaws of the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 is that it doesn't obligate companies to do anything about the gender pay gap that they identify. Yes, it's great that they're obliged to identify it, but they're not obliged to do anything about it. My party would like to see some stronger rules that actually obligate employers to not just be aware of their gender pay gap but actually fix it. Surely that's not too much to ask. We remain resolute that there needs to be more than just hope that companies will be embarrassed into fixing their gender pay gap. With the naming-and-shaming provisions that have come into effect and been revealed today, yes, there will be some impetus, we hope also, for change, but it is not enough. We need that regulatory backing, and we need the government's buying power to incentivise companies making change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that note, I might add that it's only companies with over 100 employees that even have to report their gender pay gap. This legislation only mandates employers of that large size to check whether they have a gender pay gap. Why not companies with 50 employees? Why not some other threshold that would be more akin to the international standard, which is 50, that Australian women and workers deserve? Again, the Greens have pushed for this threshold to be lowered for quite some time now, and we continue to assert that this data could be even more powerful and drive even more change if more employers—namely, those with 50 or more employees—were responsible for checking and reporting on their gender pay gap. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With my last few seconds, I want to congratulate the Workplace Gender Equality Agency for the excellent work they do and urge the government to not just leave it to business to hope that they make change but use the government's contracts and grants abilities to incentivise change and to make sure that more companies have to report on their gender pay gap.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Finance, Minister for Women, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:35</span>):  I am happy at any time of the day to debate tax cuts and Labor's tax plan, which will deliver greater tax cuts to millions of Australians, significantly more than under the previous plan. I would note that the opposition have been shamed into this today because of the way that they've been conducting this debate. I have been seeking a commitment from the opposition to deal with this bill this week since Sunday—it actually may have been before Sunday—and I haven't been given that commitment. I've been given, 'We want to deal with it, we won't delay it and we won't have many speakers.' Shock, horror, we've had lots of speakers. All of the commitments that we've had from the opposition haven't been delivered upon. I've sought to engage with the Manager of Opposition Business, and I again sought commitments from them this morning about how to deal with this bill this week, allowing all of their colleagues and others to speak and then the committee stage to deal with the bill. I still haven't got a response. Then there's this motion today because the Prime Minister has, quite rightly, called them out on seeking to delay this bill.</span>

Now this motion's come here to upend the program and the business that it has been agreed to consider this afternoon. We will support the motion, but we are considering amendments to it. I wasn't given the courtesy of having a look at this motion with enough time to consider our position, so we will be wanting to move a couple of amendments.

The amendment the government will be moving to this motion will be to ensure that we go to these bills straight after the conclusion of this debate; that final questions be put at seven o'clock; that divisions may take place after 6.30 for the purposes of those bills only; and that, presumably, once those divisions are finished, the Senate can adjourn. I think that's a reasonable position, having been given a lack of courtesy in having this motion dumped on us in about two minutes.</span>

I have been unable to get confirmation on that. I followed up this morning—I think it was this morning—on how the opposition would like to deal with these bills, seeking a commitment that we were dealing with it today, drawing to the Senate's attention the fact that we have Closing the Gap statements tomorrow and that on Thursday we have a joint sitting of the parliament.

That should be more than enough time to deal with these bills today, and we will get the job done. This is the position of the government and we look forward to the support from those opposite, if they are prepared to deal with it. This would be the chamber working together to get it done with the fastest arrangements possible.</span>

I'm happy to let other speakers put their position. But, if we are going to up-end the program to deal with these bills, let's get on and deal with it now. There is no reason to sit late tonight. We can deal with it in plenty of time. We are very happy to deal with the committee stage and deal with it quickly. Before 1.30 we finished the second reading debate—the debate was summed up by the acting minister—and we can move straight to the committee stage. Unless those opposite are seeking to filibuster through the committee stage and delay the passage of these bills, I can't see any reason—they don't even have amendments; the amendments are from the crossbench. We can deal with those very quickly, and have these bills passed and sent back to the House of Representatives as soon as possible.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:43</span>):  The extraordinary irony of this is that the Labor government are so desperate to ram their tax cuts, Labor's tax cuts, through the Senate because they say it's urgent—because they say they're running out of time. Yet the tax cuts don't actually kick in until 1 July. Why are they running out of time? I'll give you one guess, and it starts with the letter 'd'; it's the Dunkley by-election on Saturday. That's the reason why Labor is so keen to ram these changes through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have accused the opposition of standing in the way. How ironic! This is legislation based on a mistruth that they told by telling the Australian public, over 100 times after the election and numerous times before, and even 10 times since they changed their mind, that they were going to stick with the stage 3 tax cuts. But that disappeared with the ultimate mistruth told by both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. They commissioned Treasury to look at stage 3 tax cuts on 10 December last year. And then, after that time, they told the Australian public that they had no plans to change that—that they were not reconsidering changes. Now it's urgent, even though the cuts don't actually kick in until 1 July. There is no urgency to this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition's position has been clear. We will not stand in the way of tax cuts for ordinary Australians. We will not stand in the way of tax cuts that will reduce the 19c-in-the-dollar range down to 16c. We won't stand in the way of that, but that doesn't mean we condone the mistruth that was told more than 100 times by the Prime Minister, more than 100 times by the Treasurer, that got us to where we are today. We are not standing in the way of that tax cut—quite the opposite. In fact, when the statistics bear out how this legislation has played out in this chamber, you will see that the opposition only had nine speakers on the list. That is less than one-third of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We feel pretty passionately about tax cuts on this side of the chamber. Tax cuts are part of our DNA, not part of yours. You don't join the Labor Party to cut taxes. You do join the Labor Party, however, to reverse decisions of the coalition that were genuine reforms. They were real reforms that attacked pernicious bracket creep that robs your future prosperity. That's why stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 of those tax cuts were put in place by a coalition government. That mob over there had every intention of reversing those tax cuts from day one, and now they're trying to spin it to you that Labor are the party of tax cuts. They're here for ordinary Australians. That is absolute nonsense. Not only is it nonsense but they're trying to sell it to you with $40 million for an advertising campaign on the same day that they announced $14 million for Foodbank! If they were genuine about cost-of-living relief, why would you give $14 million to Foodbank but $40 million to an advertising agency to sell their mistruth?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are nine speakers from the coalition, nine only, and yet this shameless Prime Minister has had the audacity to say it is the coalition holding up tax breaks—hardly! In fact, there have been eight speakers from the Greens, there have been four from the crossbench and there have been four from the government, desperately trying to convince themselves that tax cuts are all part of being a member of the Labor Party. What nonsense. They squirm in their seats every time they talk about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They would love to have given handouts like lollies, but they know it would have been inflationary. They have been sitting there looking at the coalition tax cuts that were genuine reform. They've been doing it for months. They've been doing it since before the election, when they looked you in the eye and said, 'We won't change that.' They've been looking at it since the election, and more than 100 times they looked you in the eye and said: 'We have no plans to change that. Our plans haven't changed.' Then they looked you in the eye more than 10 times after they'd commissioned the work to do it and said, 'We're not reconsidering our position.' This is a shameless government that is now delivering Labor tax cuts on the basis of a mistruth. There is no doubt about that. And now they're perpetuating that mistruth by saying that the coalition are trying to hold it up. What nonsense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are nine coalition speakers, eight from the Greens, four from the crossbench and four from Labor themselves. When they tell you that we're trying to hold up a tax cut, don't believe it for a second. Check the facts because, quite frankly, this Prime Minister's integrity is nowhere to be seen. He has sold it to you—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator HUME:</span>
                  </a>  I withdraw the remark. The Prime Minister is trying to spin a $15-a-week increase for a small number of Australians into a tax cut for all. What a magnanimous fellow he is! Not exactly committed to reform, I might add—not exactly the ultimate reformist, is he? In fact, he's slightly more regressive than progressive when it comes to taxation reform. He's slightly more regressive than progressive when it comes to industrial relations reform too. This country is going backwards. Economic growth is at zero. Productivity is back where it was in 2017, yet energy prices are going up. Industrial relations are back to where they were in the 1970s, and tax is going up too. We had a chance to do genuine reform to our personal income tax system. We had a chance to do it, and Labor voted for it back then, and now they have reversed that decision. Do you know why? It is because they are cowards. They are cowards towards reform. They don't want to see Australians getting ahead. They genuinely don't. What they want to do is make sure that their union paymasters are well looked after.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are not standing in the way of tax cuts—not in a million years. Tax cuts are part of Liberal DNA. They're part of coalition DNA. They're not part of Labor Party DNA, so when they say that we're trying to stand in the way of reform, look twice. Look past the mistruth. Look past: 'We're not considering that. That's not our position.' Look past: 'That's not part of our policy agenda.' What is on their policy agenda? I'll tell you what's on their policy agenda. It's more taxes—taxes on the family home, negative gearing, capital gains tax, a tax on farmers, a tax on truckies. Yet, at the same time, they say: 'Grocery prices are going up. Woe is me! Isn't it terrible. The cost of living! We must get the ACCC to look at that.' They are making the taxes go up. They are making the groceries go up. You are paying for that. You are paying for their failure in economic management.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, they can point in any direction they like, but this is about the Dunkley by-election, and they are running scared because the people of Dunkley have expressed white-hot anger towards this government that has all the wrong priorities, is breaking its promises and isn't delivering on its commitments. Where is that $275 reduction in energy prices? Have you experienced it? I haven't experienced it. I'm pretty sure the people of Dunkley haven't experienced it. Where is this new year's resolution to bring down the cost of living that the Prime Minister had in January 2023? Yet the cost of living soared for the next 12 months while he concentrated on a voice to parliament that nobody voted for. The people of Dunkley certainly didn't vote for it, and now they're angry and Labor are desperate, so they've created this myth that the Liberal Party, of all parties, and the coalition are standing in the way of a tax cut. Save me! Save me! Save me! And now they've put together a motion to change hours so this can be done today, and we're still being criticised for it. This is just a nonsense. You are falling over your own logic.</span>

It was all over the shop, and I couldn't quite make it out, but what the Australian people do know is that the Albanese Labor government are going to deliver a tax cut for all working Australians.

They haven't had a consistent position on this. We know that their instinct was to oppose it. They want to claim it's in their DNA, but what is in their DNA is negativity, opposition and not wanting to see Australians get ahead. What I found really offensive from Senator Hume was calling Australians 'ordinary'. I don't think any Australians are ordinary. I think they make a fantastic contribution to our country, and that is why, in giving them a tax cut, we are recognising them for the work that they do.</span>

We are the ones who are delivering, and we want to make sure that this legislation gets through as quickly as possible. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:55</span>):  President, I'm rising to speak to the amendment as just moved by Senator Chisholm. I want to be clear about the difference before the chamber. As Senator Hume has very clearly outlined, the coalition responded to the pathetic stunt of the Prime Minister in the other place, where he stood there going, 'The Senate's standing in the way of passing these bills; it's standing in the way of Australians getting their tax cuts,' when in reality, as Senator Hume quite rightly pointed out, whether this bill passes today, tomorrow, next week or next month won't make a jot of difference to the fact that no Australian will see any difference from this legislation until after 1 July. So it doesn't matter, actually, when this legislation is dealt with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister thought he'd be a tough guy and stand there in the House of Representatives' question time and say, 'It's all your fault this is being delayed.' Little did he know, of course, that there were more Labor, Greens and crossbench senators—in fact, there were more crossbench and Greens senators—who'd spoken on the bills than there were coalition senators. So it's far from our fault. I want to be clear that I'm not seeking to cast aspersions on the Greens or crossbenchers who spoke on this. The Prime Minister was the one who wanted to turn this into some sort of tough-guy routine about who was delaying the bills, when it doesn't actually matter which day of the week they pass, because there won't be an effect on the pockets and wallets of Australians until 1 July.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, if the Prime Minister wanted to play politics with it—because, as Senator Hume quite rightly pointed out, this whole thing has been cooked up around the Dunkley by-election happening on Saturday—then we were happy to call out his politics and indicate that, sure, we'd get this done. That's because actually, on our reading of the Senate, it probably won't take much longer for this legislation to pass. The second reading list has been exhausted, there are a couple of second reading amendments and there are some crossbench amendments. It could probably all be done almost in the time that this debate has gone on. I note that when I moved this motion I sat down without saying a word. It could have been voted on and done, but the government, of course, have to have their way. Senator Gallagher had to speak and filibuster while the government came up with an alternative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just compare and contrast the alternatives, because this is what the Senate is being asked to vote on. The coalition proposed something that respects all of the Senate business to be conducted today. Nothing, in terms of other business that other senators have planned for, would be disrupted, according to our motion. At the time the Senate would have adjourned, we will instead go back to government business, get the bill done—which may well only take half an hour or so—and then go back to the adjournment debate as scheduled. No senator misses out; no other business is disrupted; every single piece of business gets done.</span>

              </p>

                  </a>  In reference to OPDs or otherwise, let's note that today is a day when there are about 20 motions for consideration during the afternoon. We've proposed something that respects the Senate and respects those processes. The government, because of an attitude not unlike the Prime Minister's—they just have to do it their way—said, 'Well, let's do it now.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequence of the government's motion will likely be to wipe the rest of the day's business and leave a situation where things stack up and roll over to tomorrow—quite unnecessarily so. My urging to the crossbench, to the Greens, is to reject the government's motion. I urge you to support the coalition's motion, but whether you support it or not is your business. The Labor Party should support the coalition's motion, the substantive motion, because that's the one that will get the bills done today, as the Prime Minister wants them done today, even though it won't make a jot of difference whether they're done today or tomorrow. But I do urge the crossbench to not fall into the trap of the government's amendment, which is just about the government being seen to have it their way. Their way actually gets in the way of most of the things that the crossbench in this place usually value: the right to have their motions considered and the right to have them done on the days they're scheduled.</span>

We have called out the Prime Minister's theatrics in the House of Representatives by bringing this motion on. Bills that were going to pass this week—they probably would have passed tomorrow—will instead pass at some time today if one of the motions before the Senate gets up. It won't make a jot of difference to the impact for Australians when the bills pass today instead of tomorrow. But go your hardest, in terms of your campaign in Dunkley over the next few days. Tell them that you've passed these bills a day earlier than would have otherwise been the case. I am sure the voters of Dunkley are looking really closely at parliamentary practice and the timing of these bills!</span>

                  </a>  I'd like to place on record, while I'm being yelled at by the opposition, that we won't support any of this nonsense. There has not been a solid case made to change the program of dealing with these bills in the ordinary manner, and the one-upmanship that's been attempted by both sides today is deeply unedifying. So let's get on with it, stick with the program, and these bills, tepid as they are, will pass. We will continue to request that the government not give perks to people earning over $200,000 and instead invest in universal services that might actually help address the cost of living.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There's probably not a more pressing issue in rural areas of our country than the takeover of land by industrialised renewable energy investments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proponents of these large-scale solar and wind projects are running roughshod over people's property rights and their right to amenity in their local community all the while our natural landscapes are being destroyed in the futile attempt by this government to reduce our carbon emissions to net zero.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fundamental problem with this so-called environmental move to renewable energy is that it's not good for the environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Solar and wind energy is not good for the environment because of the basic principle that it takes up too much of our environment. It takes up so much of our land to produce such small amounts of power. If we want to go to 82 per cent renewables, as the government does, we're going to need an enormous area of land to be covered with solar, wind and potentially batteries, and even more land for solar and wind if we want to move to hydrogen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Why are we having this massive impact on our natural environment? There's a recent study by Net Zero Australia that estimated we would need an area the size of half of Victoria covered in solar and wind to meet our net zero emissions target—half of Victoria! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When will we have the debate about whether this is what we should do to our natural landscape? Why would we destroy the environment in a futile attempt to protect it? Putting aside the fact that we account for only a small amount of carbon emissions, we're going to destroy our natural environment. If we do achieve our target and convince other countries to cut emissions at the same time—even if all that is done—what for? We will have lost our kingdom for a horse. We will have lost this beautiful country's natural landscapes, which will be destroyed totally unnecessarily.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We can't just throw out the need to protect our environment because we're going to save the world from global warming by ourselves. While the rest of the world ignores their commitments at the Paris Accord, we're willing to go forward trashing our environment to benefit, what is mostly, foreign renewable energy companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In Central Queensland alone there are 27 wind and solar projects currently proposed or being built with very little oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A number of these wind projects will require the top of mountains being cut off to install the wind turbines. Many have you will have seen the vision of the Kaban wind project in Far North Queensland. Next to it the wilderness is being cleared for the Chalumbin wind farm—four times bigger than Kaban.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Where are the advocates for the Magnificent Brood Frog and the Greater Glider—now that their habitats are being destroyed. And let's not forget that the Kaban and Chalumbin sites are abutting the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's an absolute environmental outrage. It is vandalism on an industrial scale that these projects, with government approval and often government funding, can come along and just knock off the tops of mountains to put 200 x 200 square metre pads for wind turbines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The grand irony of all this, is that while these projects get marginal scrutiny, if a farmer were to take the same action in the same areas, they'd fall foul of the regulations that were designed to protect the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For decades, farmers have been told they can't cut down a tree or change their land use in these areas because that would cause more sediment run-off to go into the rivers and then out to the Great Barrier Reef. How is it that an Australian farmer, an Australian landowner, basically can't really move one bit of dirt on their property without approval by the Greens and the government, and yet a foreign investor can come in and knock the tops off mountains onto the sides of hills and just walk away?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Where are the assessments of this? I've looked through lots of environmental impact statements on this, and there are very inadequate assessments of the wider impacts compared to what you typically must do now regarding farming and mining. We're destroying our local habitats in this country, and we are removing the wonderful natural landscapes we have all in some futile attempt to respond to climate change. The worst thing here is that no-one is pausing to look at what the cumulative impacts will be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Farmers are being accused of being criminals, but these large investors can just walk in and destroy our local environment, with no questions asked. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There must be a greater spotlight put on these practices because people are making decisions out of complete ignorance. They do not know what's going on the ground, and it will be too late when we wake up in 10 or 20 years and vast swathes of our wonderful, rural, green landscapes have been turned into industrial wastelands. People on the ground deserve this sort of oversight today. It should have been done yesterday, before we made some of these decisions, but it needs to be done as soon as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This issue has rapidly become one of the major issues in regional Australia. I can't go anywhere on the eastern seaboard without people coming up and asking for help in stopping these projects from destroying their towns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And this problem is only going to get worse because the land usage required by large-scale solar and wind projects is significantly larger than that of a coal mine, and even more of an impact than that of a uranium mine and nuclear power plant. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because not only do we have the wind and solar factories themselves, there's the mines for all the materials that are needed for these, and then there's also the need for storage to make up for when the weather isn't producing any energy. This means either more land being used through pumped hydro, destroying more homes and habitats, or battery storage requiring lithium mines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We need a better balance in this debate. If we want to reduce our carbon emissions, let's do so in a way which doesn't destroy our natural environment—which is happening right across Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I ask the people in our cities who are listening to this, please listen to the greatest custodians of our environment in our country: our farmers. They live in the natural environment and understand what is happening on their farms. It may seem like renewable energy is clean and green when you see the advertisements on TV showing these wind and solar farms looking fantastic, but out on the ground, on the front lines, the reality is coming true. Please listen to our nation's farmers before it's too late and we destroy our natural environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill serves to ensure that we're not needlessly destroying our beautiful environment by making sure that these projects are properly assessed under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;">1997 </span>('EPBC Act').</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will ensure that every large-scale solar and wind project will require approval under the EPBC Act to go ahead.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I want to recognise and acknowledge all the people who travelled to Canberra over the past days to get their voices heard about the recklessness of this rush to renewables. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Regional communities are being divided by these projects. Landholders who own neighbouring properties are left worrying about their own way of life, and about their ability to continue generations of farming.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">By rushing this transition, all we're doing is furthering the risk to our environment in a moral crusade to try and save the world from carbon emissions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is the double-edged sword of these net zero policies. To save the world we need to destroy our environment. Any average observer should be able to see that this makes no sense.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Airline Passenger Protections (Pay on Delay) Bill 2024 addresses the growing concerns surrounding passenger protections and poor performance of participants within the Australian aviation sector. This private senators' bill put forward by the Coalition represents a necessary step forward in enhancing the rights and protections of airline passengers across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian aviation industry serves as a vital lifeline, connecting our vast country and fostering economic growth and social cohesion. However, in recent years, there has been a concerning rise in the frequency of delays and cancellations, causing considerable inconvenience and frustration for passengers. It is imperative that the Australian Government take tangible steps to address these issues and ensure that passengers are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve when traveling by air.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Airline Passenger Protection (Pay on Delay) Bill 2024 seeks to achieve this objective through a comprehensive set of measures designed to protect passengers' rights and interests in situations where delays, cancellations, or denial of boarding occur. The Bill would require the Transport Minister to make rules which aim to safeguard passengers' rights and ensure a minimum standard of service across all carriers, foreign and domestic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the dynamic landscape of the Australian airline industry, competition from major airlines, both domestically and internationally, plays a pivotal role in shaping the customer experience. With a mix of established carriers and low-cost airlines vying for market share, passengers should benefit from a diverse range of options and pricing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Every Australian who travels across the country knows how much our aviation market needs greater competition—and the lower prices and higher standards that accompany it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The latest ACCC airline monitoring report confirms once again that the sector is not where it should be, as does that fact complaints to the ACCC concerning aviation have risen by nearly 200% since 2018. With around 93% of market share, Qantas and Virgin have a tighter grip on domestic air travel than another notable duopoly—Coles and Woolworths—have on the supermarket industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Governments would generally rather industry provide suitable consumer protections without the need for regulatory intervention. Unfortunately, sustained poor performance has necessitated this intervention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reality is that airlines have been held largely unaccountable for their poor performance because Australian consumers have not had the option of choosing other operators. While Australia works to foster competition in the sector, the minimum standards that would be set under this Bill provide travellers with the consumer protections they so clearly need. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill requires the Minister for Transport to establish an aviation code of conduct within 12 months, after consultation with relevant stakeholders. The rules would ensure that airlines adhere to specific standards of service and accountability towards their passengers. By establishing clear guidelines for airlines, the Coalition aims to promote transparency and accountability in the industry, ultimately leading to improved passenger experiences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Key provisions of the rules required by the Bill include:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">1. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Protection of minors:</span> Recognising the vulnerability of minors, the Bill would require the Transport Minister to make rules which mandates that minors under the age of 14 are seated next to their guardian at no extra cost. This provision is crucial for ensuring the safety and well-being of young passengers and providing peace of mind to families and caregivers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">2. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Minimum standards of treatment:</span> The Bill would require the Transport Minister to make rules which establish minimum standards of treatment for passengers who experience delays, cancellations, or denial of boarding. These standards are intended to ensure that passengers are provided with essential amenities such as food, water, and accommodation during such disruptions, thereby mitigating the inconvenience and discomfort experienced by passengers and providing passengers with protections and recourse in the event of disruptions. The minimum standards may also set compensation for significant delays, cancellations or denial of boarding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">3. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Compensation for lost or </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">damaged baggage:</span> In cases of lost or damaged baggage, the Bill would require the Minister to make rules which introduce provisions for passengers to seek compensation. It is unacceptable for passengers to suffer financial losses due to mishandling of their baggage by airlines. Therefore, this bill establishes a framework for passengers to seek compensation for the loss or damage of their baggage, thereby holding airlines accountable for their actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">4. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Provide refunds in a timely manner:</span> The rules would set out a carrier's obligation to provide refunds, and any other compensation owed, in a timely manner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">5. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Ground delays:</span> in the case of tarmac delays over 3 hours, the Bill requires rules for carriers including the obligation to provide timely information and assistance to passengers, as well as the minimum standards of treatment of passengers that the carrier is required to meet. This closes any loophole that a carrier could board a flight to avoid penalties, knowing the aircraft cannot depart within a specified time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">6. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Information:</span> The carrier will be required to provide timely information, in language that is simple, clear and concise. This includes any information regarding recourse against the carrier under the carriers obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">7. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Aviation code of conduct:</span> The requirement to establish an airline code of conduct is in direct response to the ongoing concerns by the ACCC and other consumer advocacy groups regarding carriers' pricing strategies, inconsistent fare types, and the experiences of third-party purchasers of airfares. The purpose of the code is to ensure the fair and proper treatment of passengers and that passengers reach their intended destination as booked. The code will also require the Government to clearly define a consistent definition of a ticket of carriage to apply to all tickets of carriage issued by carriers, including the minimum rights which passengers and third parties are guaranteed when they purchase a ticket of carriage from a carrier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As Australia navigates its regulatory framework for passenger protections, there is an opportunity to learn from the experiences and best practices of jurisdictions such as the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Canada. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By adopting robust rules that prioritise passengers' rights and ensure consistent standards of treatment across all airlines, Australia can enhance the customer experience, bolstering consumer confidence in the aviation sector. Moreover, a proactive approach to passenger protections can contribute to a more competitive, resilient and productive industry, where airlines are incentivised to prioritise customer satisfaction and deliver high-quality services, ultimately benefiting passengers and the broader economy alike.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Airline Passenger Protection (Pay on Delay) Bill 2024 represents a significant opportunity to safeguard the rights and interests of airline passengers in Australia and enhance national productivity.</span>

                    </a>  The government will not be supporting this motion. Our government's No. 1 priority is to keep the Australian community safe. Australians know that this was a decision of the High Court of Australia and that no parliament and no minister is above the law. The safety of the Australian community has been at the heart of every single decision this government has made. Following the High Court's decision we immediately stood up Operation AEGIS. This brought government, law enforcement and security agencies across the nation together. We have put in place four layers of protection: preventative detention; community safety supervision orders; electronic monitoring devices and curfews; and stringent visa conditions. We have set up a community protection board which places advice from our trusted law enforcement and security agencies at the centre of decision-making. We have invested a quarter of a billion dollars to arm our agencies and law enforcement. We have given our agencies the tools they need to enforce strict laws we passed in parliament last year. Our law enforcement agencies, the AFP and ABF, along with their counterparts in states and territories, are working around the clock to enforce this strict regime.</span>

                    </a>  The Greens will not be supporting this motion, because we do not support the playbook being adopted by the opposition here, which is to weaponise the High Court's decision on NZYQ. We have seen this happen time after time in this place: migrants, people seeking asylum, refugees, and migration and multiculturalism more broadly are weaponised by the opposition. They are credulously and enthusiastically reported by far too much of the media in this country, and then Labor goes to water and fails to stand up against that weaponisation. That is how we end up with thousands of lives being destroyed in offshore detention, people being murdered and raped, and children subjected to child abuse and, in some cases, child sex abuse. The Greens are not going to have a bar of that race to the bottom.</span>

                    </a>  The minister's public interest immunity claim in relation to the tabling of the NDIS financial sustainability framework is deficient. It has been made on the basis that the release of the document would be detrimental to the relations between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. When a PII claim is made on these grounds, the agreement of the states or territories to disclose the information should be sought, and they should be invited to give reasons for any objection. No such agreement has been sought, nor has the Senate been advised of any objections from a state or territory government. Therefore, the coalition opposes this motion.</span>

                    </a>  The Greens will be opposing the motion brought by the government today. Let's be really clear: this motion seeks to free them from the demand of the Senate to deliver basic documentation in relation to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The Senate demands that the government deliver this basic documentation and the Senate rejects the spurious basis upon which the public interest immunity claim has been made. The government claims that releasing this basic information would jeopardise relationships between the very state and territory governments that have already agreed to the NDIS framework target, the documentation of which the Senate now seeks. The state premiers have agreed to it. The territory chief ministers have agreed to it. The Prime Minister and Treasurer presumably agree to it. The only people who do not know this documentation are disabled people.</span>

In addition, a number of committee secretariats have adopted the practice of indicating how many remain unanswered, when answers are circulated. Under standing order 75, senators can seek explanation of unanswered questions on notice, as a mechanism for enforcing compliance. Committees also report to the Senate with respect to consideration of estimates, and the opportunity exists.</span>

                    </a>  Thanks, Senator Hume, for pursuing questions on notice, as I think it's a really important part of what we do here, and I've had frustrations about not getting questions on notice back in a timely manner. I am concerned, though, that this—on my reading—provides up to eight hours of debate, and, given how pressed for time we are here at times, I don't think that's warranted. I would support one hour to debate all of it, but I won't be supporting this motion, given the amount of time it presents us to debate it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Due to its litany of broken promises, inability to secure our borders against people smugglers, control skyrocketing immigration rates, or effectively tackle the cost of living crisis, the Albanese Labor Government has not upheld its responsibilities to the Australian people.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a matter of urgency about the Albanese Labor government. The Prime Minister's shortcomings and his government's litany of failure and broken promises demand action by this chamber. The people smugglers are back, the boats are back and Labor's immigration remains at high records, driving inflation and our housing crisis. Labor has been completely ineffective in tackling our cost-of-living crisis. Labor's own suicidal renewables obsession is driving this crisis, with record energy bills. Labor is attacking our small businesses and farmers at the command of the corrupt union bosses. And, as we discovered today, Labor supported COVID-19 vaccine mandates in Queensland that have been ruled unlawful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The polls are clear: Australians have lost confidence in the Albanese Labor government. That's because the government is not meeting its responsibilities to the Australian people. It's incumbent on the Senate to express this too and to support a vote of no confidence in the Albanese Labor government. It's the only decent thing to do. When your constituents come to you and demand why you didn't act sooner against the worst government since Whitlam's, at least you'll be able to tell them you tried. The list of failures is endless. The list of broken promises gets longer every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's referendum was soundly defeated but succeeded in dividing Australia while costing $450 million. The blame for this has been placed firmly at the Prime Minister's feet by no less than Mick Gooda and Greg Craven. The Prime Minister and his Indigenous Australians ministers blame everyone but themselves. Despite the overwhelming rejection of their politics of racial division, they continue to pursue it. We were promised $275 off our energy bills. They've only gone up, not down. We were promised a transparent and accountable government. We have anything but accountability. Labor has virtually suspended parliamentary democracy in its obscene rush to put union bosses in charge of our country and our economy. They've guillotined a huge number of legislative debates and shut down Senate inquiries. We were promised the full stage 3 tax cuts. We didn't get them. I was promised regular meetings with the Prime Minister. I've had only one. Australia was promised a royal commission into the COVID-19 pandemic. We have a toothless inquiry in its place that will do nothing but praise dictator premiers in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's incompetence on national security has left our borders wide open to people smugglers. They've released dangerous criminal immigration detainees into the community, including murderers and sex offenders. This incompetence has left our military almost completely unprepared to defend the nation. Education outcomes are in alarming decline. Labor lets teachers indoctrinate children and take them on protests rather than teaching them what they must know. Medicare is under huge strain. We face a shortage of GPs, approaching more than 10,000 in just a few years, because Medicare doesn't pay them fairly. It desperately needs a major overhaul to boost our GP numbers, but Labor does nothing to reform it. Labor just pats itself on the back for creating Medicare—how many decades ago was that?—and ignores how flawed it's become. Labor continues to destroy our environment with the enormous geographic footprint of materials-intensive renewable energy. This effort has failed to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions. They're going up, not down. And Labor has failed to reform Australia's unbalanced and unjust family law system instead of making it more fair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go back to the point. You push these renewable energies, and you talk about the environment, but you're seeing hundreds of thousands of hectares in North Queensland being destroyed to put up your wind turbines, which is destroying the flora and fauna. You have no idea of the damage that you are doing. You are actually paying billions of dollars to sustain this renewable energy scam that's going on. If it's good enough, let it stand on its own two feet. People are paying double for it through their higher electricity costs and through the taxes for your subsidies. A lot of these are just multinational companies that don't pay tax in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  While I want to acknowledge Senator Hanson's due election to the parliament here and her right to hold a view and propound a particular point of view in the chamber, I just can't agree with her characterisation of Australia that's embedded in the contribution she's just made. As the daughter of immigrants, the Australia that I live in is something that I'm proud to be a part of. I don't know any country in the world that's going to be perfect at every point of time in history, but the Australia that I know and the Australia that my children are growing up in and my grandson is growing up in is one that I'm really proud of. There's great stuff that we should celebrate. I'm frightened that the whingefest that can garner inches takes away from people's hope and passion for the great future this country has.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate the time to respond to Senator Hanson's matter, as it gives me the opportunity to clearly put on the record some of the blatant falsehoods that are perpetuated by some, sadly too often, conservative members in this parliament who seem determined to deride the nation rather than lift our sights. Sometimes, it seems they have a few issues with the truth as well. Senator Hanson's motion is less a matter of public importance and more of a grievance list. I'm going to attempt to unravel it and address each one in a respectable and sensible manner, which will echo the sensible and respectable manner of governing that is the hallmark of the Albanese government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson wishes for clarification on Australian borders, so to this point I'd like to echo what Australia's Border Force Commissioner by the name of Michael Outram has said on the public record. He said that federal funding for border control has reached its highest level since 2015. There's just the fact. This includes considerable investment which was made last year. Mr Outram, who I might add was appointed by the previous government, is continuing a policy of strong border protections and ensuring that immigration only occurs through legal mechanisms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would caution Senator Hanson and others who are privileged to serve this nation, our home, Australia: the words we use in this public place matter, and, very sadly, people smugglers—who are profit-driven and don't care who they hurt—listen to what we say in this chamber and in the media. For those opposite to state that the borders of Australia are anything but strong, and that individuals who arrive here illegally will be dealt with in any manner other than the usual course of action, is blatantly incorrect. It's, frankly, dangerous. And it's unworthy of a representative of the nation in this parliament.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson wants to know about the Albanese government's immigration plans. Well, Minister O'Neil clarified, late last year: this government's fixing the immigration system. And goodness! What a state it was in—like on one of those renovation shows: 'We've got a real fixer-upperer!'—when we got here, with huge problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the findings of the Parkinson review, the plan will have five key objectives: raising living standards by boosting productivity; ensuring a fair go for all Australians and preventing migrant worker exploitation; building stronger communities through sustainable migration; strengthening international relationships by building strong regional economic and social ties; and making the system work by being fast, efficient and fair for migrants and employers. We inherited a broken system, but we're determined to fix it. We are rebuilding the Public Service to do the job that needs to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, Senator Hanson wants to talk about Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts. Let's be clear: Labor wants every Australian to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. It's not that hard. It's a great message. It's a message for an Australia that is a better place to live. It's a message that people who've come to this country—like my parents—as immigrants, believe is the story of Australia: that they can have a better life here. Our Labor government is committed to doing what is right when it's required to ensure that every Australian who is working is going to get a tax cut in July and improve the quality of their life.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="283596" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RENNICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  I rise to support this motion, because the Australian people have lost all confidence in the Australian Prime Minister. And can I say: what a shocking display of insensitivity we saw on the weekend, when the Prime Minister was flying around between the capital cities, going to pop concerts, when Australians are doing it tough—when Australians are struggling under the cost of living. Many Australians right now are homeless because of this reckless immigration rate, which has been over 500,000 people. And how does Anthony Albanese, the Prime Minister, respond? He responds by flying around on a taxpayer funded jet, going to see Taylor Swift in Sydney and then getting on the jet and going to a concert hosted by a billionaire. These are not the hallmarks of a man who is concerned about the suffering that is being endured by the Australian people. It's about time he actually started to come up with some solutions as to how he is going to deal with the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can give him a couple of ideas. First of all, he can lower the immigration rate to a level that is sustainable. Right now—and I'm not against immigration—we really couldn't afford to have anyone coming in. I accept we'll have some people coming in. But we have got people who are homeless—and these people aren't necessarily out of work; they just literally cannot find a house to live in. We have got tent cities springing up all over Australia. And this sort of rubbish has to stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to call out Senator O'Neill for having the audacity to call this motion a 'whingefest'. This is not a whingefest. How dare the Labor Party say that of us, senators who are calling out the hypocrisy of the Labor government! They have no solutions. They've basically rebranded the tax cuts that were originally brought down by the Liberal Party, and now are trying to claim credit for them themselves. And they haven't gone far enough, I might add. As I pointed out yesterday, they are giving back, on average, about $800 a year, and the cost of living, on average, has gone up by about $8,000 per year. It's hardly a satisfactory solution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't want to hear from Anthony Albanese, the Prime Minister, accusations of a whingefest; that is not fair. The answer we now get every time we raise an issue is: 'Don't be political. Don't play politics with it.' I'm sorry, but this is from the party, the Labor Party, that played politics with a rape allegation; they weaponised a rape allegation to get at the former prime minister. What a disgrace! They weaponised the bushfires in 2019 to get at the former prime minister. They weaponised the pandemic and caused all these unnecessary lockdowns—and, as ruled today, these COVID vaccine mandates were unlawful—all for political purposes. The Labor Party has no right to come in here and call out what the Liberal Party and the coalition are trying to do in trying to hold this government to account.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area where the people have lost faith in the Labor Party and the current government is the lack of transparency. This was one of the many lies the current Prime Minister told. He said he would be completely transparent when he got into office, yet he would not release the minutes of the first National Cabinet meeting. He said he would release the minutes of the National Cabinet meeting, and he did not do that. The Labor Party voted against Senator Duniam's very good idea that we have quarterly reporting of energy pricing so that we can start to benchmark the cost of energy, because what gets measured gets improved. I cannot get from the CSIRO an actual way that net zero is calculated. I cannot get from the TGA the primers used in the PCR test to indicate whether or not the PCR test was actually testing for COVID. There are a range of issues on which the Labor Party will not disclose the inner workings of the government. That just goes to show that they're really on the side of big corporations and big unions—and, let's not forget, they wouldn't disclose the fees paid by superannuation funds to unions. This government needs to pick itself up.</span>

                  <a href="e68" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  I'm disappointed, but I have to touch on this. I listened to Senator Hanson's speech quietly. She went to the Voice. I understand the country have had the opportunity to have their say, and they did have their say, but I find it really bitterly disappointing that it has to keep being dragged up as 'dividing the nation'. I want to say this, Senator Hanson, and you know my views on this: I am so proud to work in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, where the majority of my very dear friends up there are Aboriginal. They asked me for their support, and I was very pleased to give them my support. I will just say this: when the Voice and the racial division stuff is thrown up—whoever says it—people are still hurting out there. Aboriginal people are still hurting. A lot of my Aboriginal friends in the Kimberley really took that to heart; it was a real kick in the guts for them, I have to say. You will speak for yourself, Senator Hanson, but it disappoints me when I hear that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to touch on a few other things. Senator Hanson, I have the greatest respect for you and I think I've always treated you as an individual, as you have treated me, but you make statements around corrupt union bosses, and it's the same rhetoric. We have just passed the 'closing the loopholes' bill in this parliament, and I know you didn't support the bill; I know you weren't here, for other reasons. Part of that bill was a demographic of Australian workers, a lot of whom had respect for you when you stood with them and encouraged the former government to get rid of the RSRT, which was flawed. Nothing was put back in its place. But they were bitterly disappointed that they didn't get that opportunity to stand up for transport reform. They can speak for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some issues that we went through that went to the heart of the road transport industry in the first tranche, which Senator David Pocock, Senator Lambie and Senator Thorpe supported. One was criminalising wage theft, and another was 'same job, same pay'. These were integral issues that went to the heart of the road transport industry, where there are so many really good operators, not only owner-drivers but employers—and you have never heard me cannon out the transport industry. I see us all as even. I see us all as decent human beings who get up in the morning and just want to go to work to get paid properly. But, when they didn't seek that support, the transport industry said to its elected representatives, 'Why are we any different to other sectors?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are a lot of members in this building here that protect and stand up for the farming, agriculture and horticulture industries. On my side, with 18½ years sitting on the RRAT committee, I'm a champion for the horticulture, agriculture, processing and producing industries in this nation. But then we have the likes of the National Farmers Federation. I know Senator Hanson and other senators have been very forthright in standing up for dairy farmers. I know, because I've been sitting beside you on Senate inquiries. But think about this: we know who the economic employers at the top of the supply chain are—the retail companies. People sit in their DCs not getting paid for three or four hours waiting. While those companies—and they can defend themselves—are suppressing their supply chain costs and screwing down farmers, they are doing it to my industry too. But my industry said, 'Stop, we don't want to be screwed down anymore; we want to have some minimum standards.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I get so annoyed when others on the other side stand up and scream about the poor farmers getting screwed down—which I wouldn't argue with—and say they want to reduce the cost of the transport industry. I ask all senators in this building: why is it fair to suppress one industry because another industry is being screwed down? I don't think it is, and I would be the first person in this building to stand up—no one in this chamber will beat me—if we introduced minimum standards for the agriculture industry so those economic gorillas at the top of the economic supply chain can't screw them down as they have been screwing our trucking industry. So, when we start talking and debating and we have passionate views, I just say this: every action has a reaction and a knock-on effect, but, when other industries are attacked or do not get the love because they want to be paid properly but other industries are getting screwed, we should think more about the bigger picture on this one. That is my humble opinion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">United Australia Party Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  I rise in support of Senator Hanson's motion. It is an easy one to support, isn't it? The Prime Minister, Mr Albanese, just keeps messing up over and over again. I, like many other Australians at this point, have zero confidence in this Labor government—zip, zilch, nada, not even an ounce. This Albanese Labor government can't or won't control immigration. They have greenlit more than a million people to come into this country, not because they are altruistic but because it is a Ponzi scheme to prop up our GDP. This Albanese government can't or won't police our borders, because the boats are back. The Albanese government can't or won't protect children from dangerous ideologies of all types—from climate alarmism to gender confusion and Marxism. This Labor government can't or won't hold a royal commission into the handling of the COVID response. They are trying to sweep it under the carpet—nothing to see here! They won't even support my motion to investigate excess deaths or stand up for mandated workers. Well, Prime Minister, today I have some good news: Queensland's mandatory COVID vaccine orders have been proven to be unlawful in the Supreme Court. I thank Mr Clive Palmer, who bankrolled that action. The Albanese government can't or won't solve the cost-of-living crisis, probably because its own reckless renewable energy policy is one of the key drivers of rising prices. The only thing renewable about renewable energy is the cost. The only thing green about green energy is the money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I repeatedly say the government can't or won't do this or that, because I am still not sure whether this government's total ineptitude is due to incompetence or whether it is intentional. The Prime Minister shows more enthusiasm for Taylor Swift—or, as he likes to call her, Tay Tay—than he does for governing our nation. He wasted millions on a divisive—and frankly, in my opinion, racist—referendum that tried to divide us by colour. But don't worry. Shake it off, right? He promised to lower energy prices and he promised to deliver us—and I know we keep saying this—$275 off our power bills. Where is mine, Mr Prime Minister? Don't worry; shake it off. He said, 'Under our plan, no family will be worse off but almost all families will be better off.' Now, for those playing at home, do you feel like you're better off? I don't feel like I'm better off. Don't worry; shake it off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And 149 dangerous detainees were released into the community. He shakes it off, just as the detainees have shaken off their government-supplied electronic monitoring bracelets. Rising cost of living—shake it off. He said, 'Labor has real lasting plans for cheaper mortgages.' Well, guess what? Mortgages are through the roof. We've had 12 interest rate rises under this Labor government, and Australians are paying $24,000 extra per year on a $750,000 mortgage. Shake that off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He promised to make no changes to super. Guess what? He made changes to super. He promised not to touch franking credits. Guess what? He touched franking credits. Do you know what he can't shake off? He can't shake off his litany of failures—and they are mounting up for all to see. On Saturday the Prime Minister made a special appearance at a private function where he joined a crowd of 200 political and business elites to live out their teenage dreams with none other than Katy Perry. Forget the bushfires destroying regional Victoria. Clearly there is no better way to restore your image and relate to the common man than to spend your time hanging out with foreign pop stars and other elites.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  The first job of any government is to keep its citizens safe. The Prime Minister promised to continue the coalition's important work to stop the boats, protecting Australia's shores and its people, yet we've just seen a boat funded by people smugglers and packed with asylum seekers land undetected on the remote north-west coast of Western Australia. Not detecting who's coming, the risk to biosecurity, that's a big fail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the Albanese government's bungle of the NZYQ case, where it released 149 detainees into our communities. They released seven murderers or attempted murderers, 37 sexual offenders and 72 detainees who'd been convicted of assault, kidnapping and armed robbery. Yet months later, despite having the tools to do so, this government has not yet sought orders to lock any of them back up. Not a single detainee has been redetained. How is doing nothing keeping Australians safe?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another epic fail from this government was uncovered in recent Senate estimates. During the election, the Prime Minister announced that his Labor government would fund and deliver 500 new frontline family and domestic violence sector workers. Since then, there has been no urgency, no action, no progress. Almost two years since that election promise, this Labor government has delivered two workers of the 500 promised for work in community service areas, including in the key area of domestic and family violence. Again, how is doing nothing keeping Australians safe?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a domestic and family violence epidemic in this country. It's an issue that affects lives every single day. While the Albanese government, the public servants that serve it, and the state and territory governments procrastinated, women, children and vulnerable people have had to wait and wait and wait. The Albanese government, with its claim of transparency and integrity, espouses traits that its actions do not resemble. This self-proclaimed Labor government, elected on a promise of greater transparency and integrity, has offered no real insight into the progress of this election commitment, months and months and months after I sought information. There's a sector in need, there are people in need, and this government has failed to deliver. In the Northern Territory, police statistics show a 20 per cent increase in the incidence of family and domestic violence in a 12-month period. In all states and territories, incidences of violence has gone up. The greatest increase, after the NT, are Tasmania and Western Australia. The evidence is indeed indisputable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this government, ably assisted by the Greens, ended the cashless debit card, driven by ideology, it allocated $217 million to change the card and many more millions to implement programs to deal with the fallout from its end. This Albanese government knew the removal of the card would wreak havoc on communities, and it has. This government put the safety of women, children and the most vulnerable behind its election commitment. Broken promises about lower mortgages, broken promises of a $275 reduction in electricity bills, broken promises on supporting the stage 3 tax cuts—those on the other side have unambiguous form on breaking promises. This is, however, in relation to the cashless debit card, the one you should have broken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card, which limited spending on alcohol, gambling and drugs, was important in those communities that it existed in. Instead, what's left now is broken lives and broken spirits. In the towns that were trial sites, there is evidence of increased social unrest and violence. Businesses are hurting. Residents are hurting. The most vulnerable are hurting. Show me, tell me where life is better for residents in those communities—not in Melbourne's Fitzroy, not in Queensland's West End, not in Sydney's Newtown but in the communities directly affected by the fallout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You knew devastation would follow, because you invested in programs in the trial sites, and with that came more public servants and more Indigenous industry program providers. What about more politicians? When are you going to go and show your face in Ceduna, in the Goldfields or in the Kimberley to take a look at how your handiwork has improved the lives of those that live there? Save the jet fuel—it isn't. Your actions did nothing to move the dial and improve lives for the people that live there. You did nothing that made lives safer, better. This is an overpromising, underdelivering government that Australians cannot trust to keep Australians safe. It's that simple, and the evidence proves it.</span>

When I first read about it I wasn't really sure whether it was a bit of a joke, because, quite frankly, the Albanese government has done everything that anyone would have expected of a Commonwealth government around protecting our national borders. It's really disappointing to see that the coalition is trying to politicise issues of national security once again. One can only think that there must be a by-election this coming weekend. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber we take national security very seriously. Operation Sovereign Borders, for instance, is a very mature set of policies that the Labor Party supports and has been working with those opposite on for some time. In fact, Operation Sovereign Borders funding has increased under this government, by $470 million over the forward estimates, and we've invested more in this operation than any other government has previously. So we won't be providing a running commentary on operation matters, because we know that it will simply feed information for people smugglers, and that's the last thing we want to see happen yet again in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let me be very clear. Operation Sovereign Borders is better resourced and more supported by this government than it has ever been, and the government will continue its strong border protection measures.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CICCONE:</span>
                  </a>  I am saying it with a straight face, because, quite frankly, it's a fact. More money is going into Operation Sovereign Borders than under your government. It is absurd that the opposition, the coalition, continue to misrepresent people and the government's approach to our border protection policy. The Leader of the Opposition should know better, given that he is a former home affairs minister and minister for defence. As we have heard in this place, Rear Admiral Brett Sonter, the commander of the Joint Agency Task Force with respect to Operation Sovereign Borders, has said very clearly:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The mission of Operation Sovereign Borders remains the same today as it was when it was established in 2013: protect Australia's borders, combat people smuggling in our region, and importantly, prevent people from risking their lives at sea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Any alternate narrative will be exploited by criminal people smugglers to deceive potential irregular immigrants and convince them to risk their lives and travel to Australia by boat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think that quote could be any clearer. At the end of the day, we must prevent vulnerable people—those who are trying to seek asylum—from being deceived and exploited by people smugglers and risking their lives by crossing borders illegally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, on the other hand, is determined to unravel Operation Sovereign Borders. It is worth noting recent comments by Australian Border Force Commissioner Michael Outram in which he also dismissed suggestions of a cut to the agency's funding and dispelled the opposition leader's claim:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Border Force funding is currently the highest it's been since its establishment in 2015 and in the last year the ABF has received additional funding totalling hundreds of millions of dollars to support maritime and land-based operations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what the commissioner has said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So my advice to those opposite, to the coalition, is quite simple: stop your destructive messaging to people smugglers and stop undermining our borders. The coalition are playing politics by using this Saturday's Dunkley by-election to spread false and misleading information for political purposes. The Albanese government remains committed to these policies that constitute Operation Sovereign Borders and will continue to facilitate the resettlement of refugees through the proper avenues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The response of the government to unauthorised maritime arrivals is firm and robust, and we have been fairly clear about the message we are sending to people smugglers, including those who are seeking asylum. People who arrive by boat as unauthorised arrivals won't settle here. Any unlawful entrants into Australia will be taken offshore, and the government will provide humanitarian support to people who have been resettled or returned to their home country in line with our international human obligations. The government's policies in this space will continue to be guided by a commitment to protecting our borders and maintaining Operation Sovereign Borders. </span>

This is yet another step down a dark and dangerous path that this country has been on for far too long. This motion before us today is not about keeping Australia safe. It's actually about base electoral politics. The motion before us today is about building a foundation for yet another Liberal and National parties fear campaign based on demonising refugees—demonising people who seek asylum in this country—and based on attacking the very foundations of migration and multiculturalism that have served this country so well for so long and have helped to make this country into the vibrant place that it is today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton, is a political vampire who feeds off the suffering of desperate and vulnerable people. His A game, his B game and his C game are all about fabricating and exploiting fear in our communities, and then turning around and laying all the blame for the fear that he has fabricated and sown on migrants and people who are not white in our country. This motion today is a dog whistle, a racist dog whistle, from a party that has brought us hysteria on the so-called African gangs. Recall Operation Fortitude. Recall the police-state policies and surveillance-state policies brought in under the previous government that erode fundamental human rights, and the rule of law and the very separation of powers that underpin Australia's democratic framework. Make no mistake, under Mr Dutton, we are going to see an election campaign that is based on fear and exploitation and is deliberately designed to weaponise the fear that he will sow, and weaponise it against migrant communities, refugees, people seeking asylum and the very fabric of multiculturalism in this society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the Australian Greens are going to stand up against it. We are going to stand up for refugees, for people seeking asylum, for multiculturalism and for migrants, because the Labor Party can't be trusted to do it because it is engaged in a race to the bottom on these issues with the Liberal and National parties and Mr Dutton.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  It's worth recounting some history in regard to border policy, because I seem to remember it was a former Labor immigration minister that first put children in detention—a Labor minister by the name of Gerry Hand. That's something that today's Labor Party don't like to talk about. Of course, they completely forgot that in 2008 and 2009, under former prime minister Rudd. He engaged in a reckless policy that saw over a thousand people drown at sea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is something that the coalition has got a very proud record on. I will pick up Senator McKim, because, under former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Fraser, we actually accepted a large number of refugees from Vietnam, for example. We have always participated in a very healthy refugee intake of almost 20,000 people a year, and I am led to believe that the former foreign minister Julie Bishop actually increased the number of refugees that were coming into Australia under the previous coalition government. So I don't think it's fair to accuse the Liberal Party of dog whistling on this at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I myself find it very offensive. I have spent seven years overseas and have travelled through many countries, so I get a little bit annoyed when, if you talk about trying to defend your own country's borders, somehow that makes you racist. That is not the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that strong borders save lives. You've only got to look at the large number of people who have drowned in the Mediterranean, and at the number of Africans who have tried to emigrate from Africa to Europe, to see the enormous political and social consequences of having an unregulated immigration rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this stage, it hasn't yet blown out of control with Labor, but we do know that they cannot be trusted on the borders. They cannot be trusted to keep Australia safe when it comes to these issues. They were slow off the mark last year when it came to former criminals who were in detention and then were released. The immigration minister had plenty of warning about this, but they didn't act. They were too busy focusing on the Voice and identity politics, trying to divide Australia by race. Of course, we have always promoted the idea that there is one race, the human race, and that we should judge the individual, not the identity. That is actually what true liberalism is, if people stop to appreciate that. A true liberal democracy actually protects the individual and the family. That is what the Liberal Party should always strive for, regardless of race or identity. It's not us who play the identity politics and try and pit straight against gay, black against white, race against race. That sort of stuff I find abhorrent. The identity politics that is played by the Labor Party really needs to be called out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another issue here, and it's the high immigration rate. When you've got a high immigration rate, you get large degrees of homelessness, and we're seeing that throughout Australia now. We are seeing tent cities popping up everywhere. That's endangering the lives of the homeless people who don't have a roof over their head and cannot lock their doors at night. That makes it very dangerous just to survive. Labor need to be called out about this. This isn't just about border protection. This is about dealing with a standard of living that guarantees that every Australian can have a roof over their head and walls around them every night and they can lock their doors. Labor, for some unexplained reason, have never actually been held to account as to why they decided to have so many people immigrate to Australia straight after the COVID pandemic, when so many people were trying to recover and we clearly didn't have our industries back up and running to deal with a high immigration rate. Labor just did the massive immigration. Maybe they felt like they couldn't bluff Australians, so they needed to get immigrants in as quickly as they could and get them to sign up on the electoral roll so they could get their vote, and fool them, as they often do with immigrants in the first few years—and then, once the immigrants have stayed for a while, they quickly realise that Labor aren't the people that they pretend to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I support this motion today. It is a fact that the Labor Albanese government isn't keeping Australians safe.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  I am very pleased to speak on this motion today and to be given an opportunity to set the record straight. Let me be very clear: the Albanese government do take the safety of Australians very seriously, and we are taking unprecedented measures to ensure that they are safe. This motion isn't about keeping Australians safe. This motion is about the same thing that we see from Peter Dutton and the Liberals and Nationals day in and day out, and that's negativity, stoking division. They've got no plans, but they're happy to come in here and divide Australians and bring up scare campaigns and use negativity to try to generate some sort of campaign for themselves. That's not what Australians need or want from this parliament, and it's certainly not what the Albanese government is focused on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is focused on delivering for Australians, particularly when it comes to the cost-of-living pressures. But we are also focused on ensuring that Australians are safe. When it comes to a particular issue which comes up from time to time in this debate around national security, I want to make it very clear that, under the Albanese government, border protection funding has never been higher. We saw debate and an intervention from the Leader of the Opposition this week about funding of Operation Sovereign Borders. I want to be very clear that the government remains absolutely committed to the policies that underpin Operation Sovereign Borders. Let me make this very clear: border protection funding has never been higher. Since coming to government we have invested an additional $470 million over the forward estimates into this protection of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That intervention from the Leader of the Opposition was very calculated, I would say, and it was unfortunate. It has ramifications not only for our agencies, who are working day in, day out to protect Australians, but for the safety of Australians themselves. We know that after those comments were made they were quickly dismissed, and I'm not talking about some politicians on this side of the chamber. Very soon after these comments were made we saw a statement from Commander Joint Agency Taskforce Operation Sovereign Borders, Rear Admiral Brett Sonter, that said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The mission of Operation Sovereign Borders remains the same today as it was when it was established in 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear: Rear Admiral Brett Sonter is saying that Operation Sovereign Borders remains the same. He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Any alternative narrative will be exploited by criminal people smugglers to deceive potential irregular immigrants and convince them to risk their lives and travel to Australia by boat.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what this type of misinformation does: it actually encourages the people smugglers. And that is coming from the commander of the taskforce in charge of Operation Sovereign Borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say this as well. Community safety is a lot of things. Community safety also goes to social cohesion. What we've heard in this place from those opposite and some on the crossbench is a complete disregard for the fact that words in this parliament matter. Words in this parliament have an impact on how safe Australians are. The head of ASIO said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If those opposite are concerned about keeping Australians safe then I would encourage them to look at the words they are using in this chamber. I would encourage them to make sure that the 'facts' they put forward are true and have been fact checked and to make sure that they are not looking to mislead Australians and stoke more division. We in this place have a responsibility—and the Albanese government recognises that—to make sure we don't do what the Liberal and National parties and Peter Dutton are doing, which is to go to negativity, go to division and try to divide Australians. That's not what this government is doing. We are seeking to keep Australians safe. That is why we have increased the funding for border protection; that is why we are supporting our agencies and delivering those border protection policies; that is why we're committed to Operation Sovereign Borders; and that's why we know that language in this debate really matters.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  Today the Queensland Supreme Court ruled vaccine mandates for Queensland's emergency services workers to be unlawful. What a victory for the Australian people! It's a victory that reaffirms the need for a full royal commission into Australia's response to COVID. Everyday Australians have lost trust in governments at both state and federal levels, and we've lost trust in health authorities. Recommendation 17 of the report of the Select Committee on COVID-19 stated 'a royal commission be established to examine Australia's response to the COVID-19'. That was two years ago. During his election campaign Prime Minister Anthony Albanese promised the Australian people to hold a COVID royal commission. He and Minister Gallagher, who chaired the committee, have both broken their promises. Appearing to have something to hide looks terrible for the government. It is terrible for the government. The public realise that our Prime Minister and his administration cannot be trusted to keep their word.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's Queensland Supreme Court ruling is encouraging for everyday Australians who've lost their source of income. Businesses were forced to lay off their staff unless they complied with the draconian policies, and many industries are still suffering the consequences of having to fire unvaccinated staff. Our nurses, teachers, police, firefighters and paramedics, along with other Australians, deserve to know where things went wrong and why the government turned against them. One simple green tick was the difference in being able to attend school, go to work, move around, socialise and exercise—one green tick that took our rights to freedom, life, privacy and movement. The Prime Minister must now realise that, if he takes these things from the people, trust goes with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government must restore trust and commit to a royal commission now, to commence as soon as the current inquiry into appropriate terms of reference defines those terms. The Queensland Supreme Court said there was an abuse of process and that they did not consider the loss of human rights fundamental to Australian democracy.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  I too rise in support of Senator Liddle's motion. As she has very articulately said, those opposite have no idea of how to genuinely keep our nation safe. They not only don't know how to keep our nation safe but also do not know how to keep our nation secure. We've heard a lot of pious comments and overblown rhetoric from the Greens and pious statements about Operation Sovereign Borders. Our problem on this side of the chamber is not with the amazing men and women who serve in Operation Sovereign Borders. It is about those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is probably no-one else in this chamber who has personally witnessed the results and the carnage to human beings of terrorism and serious and organised criminals, which is what people-smugglers are. They commoditise people and offer them false hope. It doesn't start at our waters or on our borders. It starts in source countries. This is where this government has continually been weak. In 2001, I experienced and saw first-hand how John Howard responded. Do you remember? 'We will determine the circumstances in which people come to our nation.' There is a right way that people come to this nation, and there is a way through people smugglers, criminals, who commoditise and quite often cause the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last time the Labor Party was in government—who can forget? It was 2007 to 2013—what did they do? They did exactly what they are now in the process of doing—putting the people smugglers back in business right up the supply chain through to source nations. What happened when the last Labor government, the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, did that? More than 50,000 people paid people smugglers to come to this country. These people endured the most dangerous of all travels, through many countries of safe harbour for many of them, along the way. There were 50,000 people who arrived on more than 800 boats. At least 1,200 people died the most horrific deaths at sea. There is absolutely nothing compassionate about a system that is encouraged and promoted by government policy. You opposite might not have seen what a body looks like floating in the water after a few days, particularly a baby's, but I have, and the men and women of the Australian Border Force who have to deal with the consequences of your policy are forever scarred. Under those opposite, over 8,000 children were in detention because they lost control of the borders. There's nothing compassionate about that. Those opposite opened 17 onshore detention centres for the 8,000 children, many unaccompanied, and for the adults, and two offshore processing centres were opened by those opposite. There is nothing compassionate about that, and many people still in this country are still battling the consequences of being allowed in illegally by those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I was part of a very successful coalition government that closed 19 detention centres, saving over $1 billion a year. We removed all children held in detention on Manus and Nauru that were put there by Labor. We ended Labor's regional processing agreement with PNG and signed a memorandum of understanding for the regional processing system in Nauru. We also repealed the disastrous medevac legislation. We successfully resettled or returned more than 1,700 people, including 1,000 under the US resettlement agreement and 450 to New Zealand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, what are we now seeing? It's almost unbelievable to me that those opposite did not learn from the disastrous policies of the previous Labor government. People died. People drowned. People were exploited. People were commodified on false hope and a promise. Those opposite, the boats are starting to return because you've put people smugglers back in business. Shame on you all, because people will die.</span>

The <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Amendment (Paid Family and Domestic Violence Leave) Act 2022 </span>(Amendment Act) was an important step towards making sure that no employee is forced to make a choice between earning a wage and protecting the safety of themselves and their family.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Amendment Act was the first parliamentary action of the Hon Tony Burke MP, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. This recognised the need to take quick action towards the Government's goal to end gender-based violence in Australia, set out by the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022-32.</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Childhood Gender Transition Prohibition Bill 2023 be referred to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 30 June 2024.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Childhood Gender Transition Prohibition Bill 2023 was introduced into this place last year. It is a bill which seeks to prohibit health practitioners from knowingly providing gender clinical interventions to a minor that are intended to transition the minor's biological sex. What that actually looks like in practice is the process of cross-sex hormones, puberty blockers and the processes of castration, vasectomy, hysterectomy, metoidioplasty, some names I cannot even pronounce, phalloplasty, vaginoplasty or mastectomy on children. The fact that we are here today in 2024 even discussing these matters is quite astonishing. What the bill intends to do is seek to implement Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which seeks to prevent all forms of physical or mental violence, injury, abuse, neglect, negligent treatment and the like on children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look to the bill itself, it appears in several parts, which are as follows. The first operative part of the bill would seek to provide prohibitions on medical practitioners involving themselves in these particular prescriptions, surgeries or cross-sex hormones. The second part of the bill seeks to provide obligations upon the medical regulatory body to provide sanctions to medical practitioners who knowingly do that. The bill also seeks to limit or prohibit Commonwealth funding for these clinics in their entirety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past decade or so there has been a drastic increase in the number of children and teenagers voicing confusion about their gender. It's a term known as gender dysphoria. The year before last, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> reported, through a freedom of information request, the frightening statistic that 2,067 young people had attended public gender clinics in Australia in the previous year, 2021, which was almost 10 times the number in 2014, when there were only 211 children. We are talking about children. The number of under-18s being prescribed puberty-suppressing drugs, coincidentally, shot up from five in 2014 to 624 in 2019. The increase in the number of young people seeking such treatment is not only related to Australia. We've all heard of the fallout from the Tavistock Centre and the number of gender dysphoria treatments in their under-18s, which had been skyrocketing prior to the clinic closing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is tragic in this scenario, however, is the wave of what are now known as detransitioners, children who in later life regret decisions that were made, decisions that were perhaps ill advised or where there were other ways of dealing with them, such as through mental health care or counselling of any form. The lesson learnt from these various jurisdictions is clear: the proliferation of these drugs and surgeries will ultimately lead to an epidemic of detransitioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that we are not talking about this in this country is staggering. We have seen several attempts in this chamber—one by me, I think one recently by One Nation and one earlier—to simply get this matter to a hearing. This is a bill before the Australian Senate. It is deserving of a hearing. This is a very complicated and very difficult area. Even the experts agree with that. The experts agree that it actually isn't easy to find, read and understand all the information. Researchers at Westmead Hospital concluded that one of the biggest challenges for clinicians working with children who present for assessment of gender dysphoria is the effect of the polarised sociopolitical discourses in their daily clinical practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, if there was ever a matter that required the caring gaze of a Senate hearing, it is this. I can almost hear the voices from the other side of the chamber, however, and our friends in the Greens. I know, because I've heard it several times already before—that this will simply traumatise children and place enormous pressure on families. We're talking about serious medical intervention in the lives of children. In most states in this country—in all states, I would say—we don't allow children to drink under the age of 18, to get tattoos when they're under 18 or to drive a car until they're 16. Yet here in Australia children as young as three years of age are being offered this kind of intervention. It is absolutely shameful. It is shameful that there isn't more protection for these children, many of whom will go on to regret what they have been involved in. It is even more shameful that the people in this chamber continually refuse to allow this matter to be properly debated as it should, in the confines and the surrounds of a Senate committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a complicated matter. We could go on and on. I will say that I expect that this will be put to a vote. I implore those in this chamber to take a different look at what we are proposing here. This is perfectly reasonable, as is the procedural request for this matter to be simply taken to a hearing, and I ask that this motion be supported.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be very clear that health care should be between patients, their families and their doctors, and the treatment of trans and gender-diverse people, for the young person, is a matter for the young person, their families and their doctors. Children under 18 in Australia can only access transgender health care with the consent of both of their parents or through a court order. Clinical guidelines stipulate that children accessing gender affirmation treatment should be treated by a multidisciplinary team of expert clinicians, including mental health practitioners. This treatment occurs largely within hospitals under the jurisdiction of states and territories. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As government senators have outlined in response to previous attempts to refer this to inquiry, advice has been received from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians that said a national inquiry would not increase the scientific evidence available regarding gender dysphoria but would further harm vulnerable patients and their families. We know this. We know that an inquiry of this kind would cause further harm to people who are already vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABS released statistics today, and maybe the senators opposite and those on the crossbench haven't had a chance to see these statistics. They say that more than one in four trans people aged 16 to 85 have seriously thought about taking their own life at some point in their lifetime, and that's compared to one in six people who are not transgender. We are talking about a public debate about people's lives that should be confined to discussions with their health care.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion shows again that the Liberal Party are moving more towards right-wing populist policies rather than fact based policies that bring people together, increase wages or protect people at work. That's not what they're interested in. Peter Dutton and the LNP are all about this negativity, and they have zero plan for anything else. That's why they always put politics above helping other people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also say this to the senators on the crossbench who will consider this motion but not understand the context of what this motion means to other people outside of this place. This is not only the week of the Sydney Mardi Gras, a moment when the LGBTQI community celebrates but also commemorates the lives that have been lost and the laws that have been changed to decriminalise the lives that we live, but it is a week when the queer community, particularly in Sydney, is mourning the unnecessary and tragic loss of life of Jesse Baird and Luke Davies. To move this motion this week is deeply insulting. I fear these Liberal Party senators and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, know the context and moved this motion today anyway. I urge those senators on the crossbench to acknowledge this and to stand up against this unnecessary division. I invite those Liberal senators who share these views to ensure that this motion is not moved any further. At the end of the day, we want to protect young people, and that's not what this inquiry would do. It would actually cause harm, when harm is not needed.</span>

I rise to support Senator Antic's motion. The Childhood Gender Transition Prohibition Bill 2023 is worthy of examination. It needs to be looked at. I think it's entirely appropriate, when bills are brought before the Senate, that they go before Senate committee inquiries. The committee is chaired by Senator Rice, who I am sure would oversee this inquiry with sensitivity, and so I wholeheartedly support—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point is that we can be a mature body. We should be a mature body. When issues as important as this are brought forward, we should look at them. So I rise in support of Senator Antic's motion. The issue, of course, is deeply sensitive for some Australians. However, it must be addressed and debated without the threat of the rise of the cancel culture using emotive language that will cut across and deal with what is otherwise a very sensitive issue that parents and children are facing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I personally struggle to understand how this issue is even up for discussion, yet here we are. We have children that are being referred to services and medical treatment that is, in many cases, irreversible. As Senator Antic was saying, a child can't vote, can't get a tattoo, is not legally allowed to drink, is not legally allowed to smoke, yet we have a situation where children are prescribed this treatment. There's concern that there aren't the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the protection of those children is paramount. I think it is absolutely right that this Senate has a look at the framework that surrounds this whole issue to make sure that children aren't being exploited or referred to services and medical practices that would ultimately have a long-term impact upon their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that there are some that don't feel comfortable with this. I appreciate that there are some that don't feel comfortable with this. But the reality is that we are talking about the long-term impact upon children and the long-term impact upon our society, and we're seeing a deterioration of standards. I think it's highly appropriate that this parliament have a look at this issue. I believe that we can have a debate. I understand that Senator Green brought in some arguments. She even impugned a motive in regard to how this motion was first put together. I think we, as a parliament and as a Senate, can have a sensitive and mature look at this important issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an issue that is raised by many people within my state of Western Australia. I get quite a lot of correspondence from people that are very concerned about this. We're seeing the huge rise in extra litigation that's now occurring, particularly in the United States, against doctors and practitioners who have been part of a child's transition—later on in life, they're now suing the doctors. What sort of environment do we want to have here in this country? As I said, I think it's entirely appropriate that we take a look at this issue. I trust that the Senate can do that in a respectful way, and it is something that I would wholeheartedly support.</span>

I'm yet to receive an answer to both the question asked at the cost-of-living hearing and the question asked at Senate estimates. I'm going to ask you again because, according to your own costings, there is $28 billion of additional revenue from personal income taxes after this legislation goes through. That's a lot of additional tax, and somebody is paying for it. Minister, how many Australians will be paying higher taxes under this legislation compared to the existing law on 1 July this year?</span>

That's why governments of both major parties return bracket creep when it's affordable and sustainable to do so. You'll notice that, in the reforms to the tax proposal that was outlined by the former government, this does that by lowering the two thresholds and dropping the two tax rates; sorry, I'm getting back into tax land! That's how we're dealing with bracket creep. It provides relief, and 84 per cent of taxpayers will be getting a bigger income tax cut than they would have under the former government and paying less tax. By 2034-35, someone earning an average income will pay $21,635 less tax than they otherwise would have without these tax cuts.</span>

Doesn't that mean that you're taking money off taxpayers and that it's really a stealth tax because taxpayers don't know they're moving into a higher tax bracket? Bracket creep is when the brackets stay the same but people's wages inflate and they move into a higher tax bracket—so they automatically pay a far higher rate of tax in the next bracket and they don't even know it. Isn't that tax by stealth?</span>

I think Australians understand marginal tax rates and the interaction between their earnings and those tax rates. I would say again that's why, regularly, tax cuts are provided to taxpayers—to deal with bracket creep and provide other assistance where that's possible, where it's affordable and sustainable to do so. I say that not to say 'when we choose to' or 'when we feel like it' but because we have to manage a budget responsibly as well. People expect that because taxes pay for all the services that people consume and expect to receive from their government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:03</span>):  Minister, I remind you, before asking my next question, that former deputy commissioner of taxation Jim Killaly, who was in charge of large companies and also international matters for the Australian Taxation Office, said back in 1996 and 2010 that 90 per cent of Australia's large companies are foreign owned and have paid little or no tax since 1953, due to Liberal legislation that was passed in 1953 letting major foreign owned corporations off the hook. Bob Hawke made sure that the Labor Party was also giving gifts to major foreign corporations by letting the world's largest avoider of tax, Chevron, off the hook for tax in the North West Shelf. Surely the fix to bracket creep is to index brackets. If we'd done that 10 years ago we would have saved the people $44 billion in tax. You say, 'Where can we get the tax from?' I get that tax is the cost of government, that tax is the price of government and that tax has to be paid, but foreign corporations in this country are paying little or no company tax.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That means they're using our services that every mum, dad, family and small business are paying for in this country, and they're doing it for free. We used to be the world's largest exporters of gas, but we get very little for it, and these foreign companies are sending it overseas. Japan gets $3 billion a year from the import duty for our gas going into their country, and we get very little for it. So what I say to you is that we can't afford it because you're not taxing foreign multinationals adequately. You're letting them off the hook.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because you didn't index brackets in this attempt, over the next four years Australians will pay $38 billion more tax than if you indexed brackets. Surely, you can look at the spending and cut some of that back. Surely, you can look at the taxation of foreign multinationals and make sure they start paying their fair share. Then let Australian families off the bracket-creep hook. Why can't you do that proper budget for the Australians? </span>

I think your final question was around budget management, and the work we have done in the last or two budgets and MYEFO has been to repair the budget. The deficits are a lot less, going forward. We've had a surplus budget, we've lowered our debt, we've contained spending despite the pressures the budget is under and, where we've had revenue windfalls, we have returned the vast majority of it—over 80 per cent, 88 per cent I think—to the budget to repair it. We do have to manage the budget responsibly and we've been able to do that and provide bigger tax cuts to more Australians.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On your point about multinational tax reform, I don't necessarily agree with all of it because I haven't been able to verify some of the things you've said. We agree that we should be making multinationals pay their fair share of tax—we've got a bill before the parliament on that, we've got a bill on PRRT and we've got a bill on high-balance super, and that is about making sure we are putting the budget on a sustainable footing; that we're able to pay for defence, aged care, hospitals, the interest on our debt and the NDIS; and that we are able to pay for those services that people expect. But this plan does deal with bracket creep, so I don't accept the position that you put saying we don't. That's part of the reason why we're doing it. The Treasury advice there is very clear. Our plan provides better protection against bracket creep for 70 per cent of all taxpayers over the decade, including the average taxpayer and those on low and middle incomes.</span>

You are not indexing the brackets themselves; you're just making a one-off adjustment. As soon as that happens, with inflation continuing, you will continue to increase revenues. Inflation hits families in two ways: first of all, goods and services cost more; second of all, they move into a higher tax bracket and they pay more tax. They actually end up with less take-home pay. So I don't buy your argument. Why doesn't Labor want to fix bracket creep?</span>

This plan does deal with bracket creep by reducing two tax rates and increasing two tax thresholds. It does deal with bracket creep. In particular, as I said in my previous answer, for average taxpayers—those on the average wage, and low- and middle-income earners—this substantially improves the money they get back in their pockets and returns that bracket creep. But you disagree with me—I will keep making that point, and, presumably, you will keep making yours.</span>

That is a fact. The only way to beat that is to index the tax thresholds. As to supporting my amendment, it shows you do not want to stop rampant increases in tax or you want to keep bracket creep to exploit taxpayers. Why don't you want to fix bracket creep properly by indexing it so that brackets rise as inflation rises and wages rise, so people stay within the same bracket and there is no creep? Why don't you want to fix bracket creep?</span>

I understand your amendment seeks to do that. I don't think you've moved your amendment, but I may as well cover off. We are not supporting your amendment. The approach in this bill is preferable to your amendment because it provides governments—I'm talking about not our government but all governments; this is the way it's been done—with greater flexibility to respond to fluctuations in the economic cycle. This proposal does deal with bracket creep. It does return money to taxpayers.</span>

The point I'm trying to make is that we already have a very complex tax system, which is confusing for small businesses and confusing for people who don't have access to lawyers and deep pockets. It's confusing for individuals and families. We always support returning more money to taxpayers, and $15 a week is a lot of money to many people. In the overall scheme of things, it's not very much. In a few years, you'll be recovering far more. Is there any plan to actually reform taxation properly, to do a comprehensive reform so that the tax system becomes simple, clear, effective, efficient, fair and honest? Is there any stomach within the Labor Party to be honest with the people of Australia and really reform taxation comprehensively?</span>

We won't be supporting it, because the stage 3 tax cuts were originally designed to address bracket creep but do it in a very structural, costed and fiscally responsible way. While this measure would address bracket creep, you're absolutely right that the fiscal cost of this change isn't known, and that's why we couldn't support it at this stage. The Prime Minister's broken promise means that delivering the stage 3 tax reforms as they had been legislated originally is now impossible, but the coalition remains committed to fighting bracket creep and to enshrining aspiration because strong leaders keep their promises, even when it's hard to do so.</span>

The bill before the chamber does deal with bracket creep. It delivers tax cuts for 13.6 million Australians. It's carefully calibrated to provide more cost-of-living relief. I know that Senator Roberts said that it was $15. I think that figure he is using is the extra that people will get. Those people will get $15 extra on top of the tax cuts they otherwise would have got, and, for many people, that is a substantial amount of money.</span>

It gives government the flexibility to make those decisions when it's affordable to return bracket creep in a way that can maximise those returns.</span>

The surplus has only been around for two years because of the strength of our agricultural production and our coal and iron ore exports. That's the only reason. What we're seeing is a country that is at the mercy of international prices for its major primary products. If something happens, then we have to rely upon bracket creep to pull us out of the mess, and that's not fair to Australian families and individuals.</span>

We've had many more people in jobs earning money and therefore paying tax than we have previously. Unemployment is at a record low; participation is at a record high. It's kicking up a bit now, but that has contributed significantly to the improved position of the budget. Yes, we acknowledge that. Part of that has allowed us to pay debt down so that we're not paying as much into the future and generations of the future are not paying those interest costs—the fastest-growing cost on the budget is managing the interest costs on our debt—and it's allowing us to deal with all of those areas of pressure that we talk about all the time in here: the NDIS, aged care, hospitals and defence. They are all big costs coming at the budget, and we do have to manage it in a responsible way.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:18</span>):  I'm not pretending it's easy. It's complex. But this is excessively complex. You're addressing the need for increasing tax revenues for the extra expenditure, including interest payments, but what you're not saying is that a lot of that money is coming from individuals through immigration, which is putting enormous pressure on house prices and inflation. That's a real impediment to people looking for houses right now. We've got people in Queensland sleeping in tents in showgrounds in Gladstone, in parks in Bundaberg, in parks and on the banks of the river in Brisbane and in Ipswich, Logan and Townsville. I think we're making a rod for our own back. When are we going to see comprehensive tax reform to take the load off individuals and put it onto large corporations so they start paying their fair share?</span>

I think if you talk to many domestic companies they'll say they're paying their fair share of tax right now. People have a view about that. Individuals do contribute substantially to the Commonwealth budget through income tax. We need to generate revenue in order to pay for services.</span>

We've got a full suite of programs. We acknowledge that supply is the problem, and the Commonwealth are right in there with our sleeves rolled up, working with states and territories, to do whatever we can to generate more supply. Also, as you know, some of the changes we've made to the migration system have ensured that those net overseas migration numbers that we've seen rise post COVID are coming back down to our more traditional rates.</span>

The government will be opposing these amendments. These amendments would remove the 37 per cent tax rate from 1 July 2026, and the legislation would be repealed. By removing the 37 per cent tax rate, this amendment would make Australia's personal income tax system less progressive. It's also fiscally irresponsible. It would significantly increase costs over the medium term and place upward pressure on inflation. This amendment reduces the scope for future governments to respond appropriately to economic circumstances. </span>

The Prime Minister's broken promise means that delivering the stage 3 tax reforms as they've been legislated is now impossible. While we very much support the principle behind Senator Babet's amendment, as responsible economic managers, we can't support the amendment without knowing what the fiscal cost would be. The coalition is committed to going to the next election with a tax reform package that is fully costed and is in keeping with the stage 3 tax reforms. We remain committed to fighting bracket creep and enshrining aspiration, because strong leaders keep their promises even when it's hard to do so.</span>

I spoke about the fact that I've been approached by members of Queensland's Jewish community, who gave me a dossier of quite vile antisemitic Facebook posts and other material which they've been subjected to. Since that time, I have now received a letter which I want to speak to during this adjournment debate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I say that I'm going to be very careful when I'm reading this letter from someone who's written to me as both a teacher and a concerned parent in relation to antisemitism in our Queensland schools. I'm going to be very careful that I do it to maintain the anonymity of the person who wrote to me. The parent is concerned to make sure that their anonymity is protected, and I want to do my best to do that. I'm going to read parts of this letter from this parent, which is heartbreaking:</span>

                  </span>I hope this message finds you well. I write to express my grave concern about the increased experience of antisemitism for children in our schools. I write as both a teacher and a concerned parent of … children who have all experienced negative sentiment while attending school. </span>

                  </span>The reported increased incidents of antisemitism are extremely distressing and pose a significant threat to individuals. It is essential for our leaders to address this issue head-on, implement measures to curb antisemitic behaviour and foster an environment that promotes tolerance and understanding. My … children all now have stories to share of victimisation in the playground, hurtful remarks, labels and threats. This was unimaginable in Brisbane for our family prior to 7 October.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This teacher and parent recounts how a fellow student came up to one of their children and said, 'I have hatred for all Jews.' This is what was said to this teacher and parent's child by a fellow student in a Queensland school.</span>

                  </span>We informed the school but are still unclear how this was dealt with from their end. I have needed to manage school refusal from my children due to their feelings of unsafety, while feeling a knot in my stomach with worry about if they are indeed safe if we do send them? We felt compelled to make the difficult decision to move my son to a private school to ensure that he feels safer each day. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this parent and teacher had to move their child to a different school because of antisemitism in schools in Queensland. I continue:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Late last year, promotional material shared by local members of the Greens party was targeted at children and teachers to participate in a … rally. I was deeply concerned to see children being swept up in a one-sided political agenda which will only incite more one-sidedness and hate along with misunderstandings. The flyer also contained an image of Israel superimposed with the Palestinian flag which is representative of a call for the removal of Israel and its people from the map. This is deeply worrying and unsettling in the context of being directed towards children. These images in our community along with swastikas are clear messages of hate and are impacting on the wellbeing and safety of our children. I wrote to our local Greens member … in November—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I urge you again to take a proactive stance against antisemitism in our schools and in any form of political marketing targeted at children and trust that, with your influence, we can collectively work towards creating a community that is safe, inclusive, and free from the shadows of antisemitism.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is from a teacher and parent in my home state of Queensland. These were terrible, terrible, terrible experiences suffered by the children of that teacher and parent at a school in my home state of Queensland. It shouldn't happen. It shouldn't happen in this country. It's unforgivable. But it's happening, and we know it's happening because the Blueprint Institute—just today, a week after I received that letter—released the report <span style="font-style:italic;">Antisemitism </span><span style="font-style:italic;">in Australian schools</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: an examination</span>.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the course of the estimates process I raised the fact that, whilst the government has provided money to enhance safety at Jewish schools and preschools, there has been an absence of an allocation of sufficient funds to conduct a program to support agencies, NGOs and the wider community to combat the scourge of antisemitism in our community. There was a noble grant that was offered, a social cohesion measures grant, to combat Islamophobia. Its purpose and objectives were to combat Islamophobia, develop communications to combat Islamophobia and racism, and mitigate the harms of misinformation and disinformation narratives that impact communities. That's an important grant, with noble purposes, but what we need to see—as the evidence being provided from parents and teachers and other members of the Jewish community across this country and the research are indicating to us—is the Labor government dedicating sufficient funds to a program to combat the scourge of antisemitism. That's what's needed.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:42</span>):  Where's the scrutiny on our health authorities? During COVID, drugs were rushed through that would never have been approved on safety and efficacy grounds, such as molnupiravir and remdesivir. Last year, these two inhuman pharmaceuticals cost taxpayers $1 billion. Alternatively, tried and tested drugs that are out of patent could have been used for a fraction of the price. Remember that our authorities and the mouthpiece media called ivermectin 'horse paste'. The statist Left rushed to demonise anyone who defended ivermectin, because the control side of politics—the so-called Left—loves to follow orders. Ivermectin is a Nobel-Prize-winning antiviral for humans. Over 40 years, it has saved millions of lives. Around the world, it's now been proven safe and effective as an early-stage treatment for COVID, as it always was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our health authorities demonised ivermectin to prevent early-stage treatment of COVID in order to build demand for an untested novel mRNA vaccine. How many died because of the long-term strategy that our health authorities followed and pushed—a strategy to use COVID as a cover to introduce a class of mRNA drugs that the public would have rightly baulked at and rejected? How many died from the side effects of mRNA technology—technology that was not tested in Australia and was not tested off the production line, for which the method of production was changed after overseas testing and approval and the fake trials were at best shambolic and at worst criminally negligent? Why would our health authorities tolerate this? Simply because of a thing called the patent cliff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pharmaceutical companies are profitable because they develop a new drug and then get a patent, exclusive sale of the drug for 25 years. Drug companies can afford to put that drug through the approval process because once it's approved they add the approval cost to the selling price—kerching, kerching!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The system of drug patents has created a $2 trillion industry whose tentacles of influence extend to political parties, who happily accept donations, and to health authorities. Their tentacles extend to the USFDA and Anthony Fauci's National Institutes of Health, who hold patents on drug processes they license to big pharma in return for hundreds of millions of dollars in personal royalties. Their tentacles extend to the World Health Organization, the United Nations and the World Economic Forum, whose young global leaders sit in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is influence that our healthy authorities cultivate while coveting lucrative careers in the pharmaceutical industry. For example, just eight months after approving Pfizer's untested COVID injections, Professor John Skerritt, former head of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the TGA, is now on the board of the pharmaceutical industry lobby group Medicines Australia. This isn't the normal operation of a free-enterprise system that One Nation would support; this is a cabal of greedy, unprincipled, evil individuals treating everyday citizens as cash cows. They want everything you have for themselves, including your health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The patent cliff is upon us. There's increasing urgency—desperation—in the measures being rammed through government. Two-thirds of the revenue is from drugs being sold to you that are out of patent now or will go out of patent over the next five years. That threatens big pharma's harvesting of humans for profit. Modern drugs, once out of patent, can be made for cents per tablet. India specialises in that. Australia used to, and we can do it again. The patent cliff threatens the entire pharmaceutical industry and stops the ability of chemical pharmaceuticals to do better than they do now, in terms of profit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From where are the new patents going to come? I'm glad you asked, Mr Acting Deputy President: from mRNA of course. There are 400 new mRNA vaccines and drugs currently under development. Such is the expected volume of these things that two manufacturing plants are being prepared here in Australia. Our health authorities decided to press ahead with mRNA technology to save the pharmaceutical status quo—the pharmaceutical gouging of people to extract exorbitant profits. Patient harm apparently no longer matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, a study of 99 million COVID-jab users, including in New South Wales and Victoria, found the product was not safe. The study was published by Elsevier, for more than 140 years the world's leading scientific publisher and data analytics company. The study showed the following conditions were occurring above baseline levels: brain and spinal cord swelling, up 380 per cent; blood clots, up 320 per cent; Guillain-Barre syndrome, up 250 per cent; and myocarditis, up 278 per cent for Moderna and up 350 per cent for Pfizer. After a second injection, myocarditis was up a damning 610 per cent and pericarditis was up 690 per cent. I told you so four years ago. Many good people warned that COVID products were not tested, that they were experimental, and that forcing them on the general population was an insane, inhuman abuse of government power. Now look at those figures. It's another area for a royal commission to investigate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time for an entirely new medical paradigm in this country and throughout the West. Pharmaceutical companies are embracing mRNA as their saviour because it can be patented. They can charge whatever they want for it, and compliant health bureaucrats like our TGA, acting out of self-interest, protect pharmaceutical companies from financial harm. The expert medical advice the TGA relies on comes either directly from drug companies or from advisers who have worked for big pharma, who have accepted research grants or sponsorship from big pharma, or who covet doing so in the future. After all, $29-million Sydney harbourside mansions don't just buy themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are things that make for a royal commission. One thing that should not wait for a royal commission is a system for getting cheap, natural remedies into our health approval system. Australia needs an office of the consumer advocate to oversee complaints and the harm bureaucrats cause—bureaucrats who appear incapable of acknowledging odious and obvious adverse events. We need a customer consumer advocate or a natural product advocate to advance natural products that can't be patented but are safe and effective treatments—products to be listed under schedule 4 and offered under the PBS as frontline medicines, not watered down and sold in supermarkets as complementary medicines so their efficacy can be dismissed. Albicidin, for example, is a natural antibiotic with clear potential to become our leading antimicrobial. It's proven to not create resistance. Albicidin could be the answer, and it's highly likely to be the answer to antimicrobial resistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Antimicrobial resistance is the new climate change, allowing for control over agricultural, medicine, and household and industrial cleaning in the name of reducing use of antimicrobials. That's why an alternative solution, using an antimicrobial that doesn't cause antimicrobial resistance, is being ignored and quietly buried: to protect globalist profits and to control people—and to hell with human and animal health and safety! Globalists want control. Globalists need control to complete their agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take another example. Blushwood is an Australian native berry. It was shown, in a 2014 test, to kill skin cancer in just 10 days. Did our health authorities rush to understand this plant and bring a potentially lifesaving medication to market? No, they did not. Another one is conolidine, a natural treatment for severe pain. Ignored! Natural remedies include cannabis. Senator Pauline Hanson has led the way, advocating medicinal cannabis since 1996. I joined her, and now there are others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent paper pointed out that natural products work differently to chemical products, yet our system for understanding and testing substance efficacy is geared to chemical drugs. The paper and system offer a new way of measuring efficacy that confirms plants like cannabis and conolidine do work, and explains how they work. The truth is this: currently, only when a product is patented and presented as the TGA on a plate, ready for the TGA's rubber stamp, does it enter our pharmaceutical system. I urge the Minister for Health and Aged Care to introduce a consumer natural products advocate to provide much-needed supervision and accountability over our health authorities. Failing that, I ask the Greens to consider if the agency they're establishing with the Legalising Cannabis Bill would be better suited to handle natural medications in general—those that the TGA refuse to handle in addition to cannabis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not offering medical advice on the examples I've used in this speech; I'm asking why the health department's and medical schools' first response is the scalpel and the prescription pad instead of natural medications that cost a fraction of the price. We must have an independent office in the TGA with the budget to sponsor natural alternatives through the safety, testing and efficacy stages, and to have these promoted to doctors who most likely have never even heard of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must look at the influence of pharmaceutical companies in the education system for medical people, in their relationship with former health department executives and their influence through advertising and sponsorship. The toxic, inhuman killer 'pharmaceutical only' model is failing Australian taxpayers. People are dying needlessly. Stop so-called health authorities committing homicide, child homicide and infanticide. As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I say call a royal commission now and make an immediate start on the obvious reforms to our health administration that we need.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:52</span>):  Last week was a significant occasion in Perth. We hosted the Prime Minister and the cabinet in our wonderful city during an unprecedented heatwave. This month alone, Perth has experienced a record seven days over 40 degrees. WA has also hosted 15 of the hottest locations in the world all in one day. I'm sure this wasn't noticeable to the Prime Minister and the cabinet, travelling from their air-conditioned planes to temperature-controlled meeting rooms via government air-conditioned cars. But I am particularly disappointed that neither the PM nor the cabinet ministers saw this as an opportunity to talk about the red-hot elephant in the room.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have just pulled through the hottest January ever recorded. Up north of Perth, places like Geraldton are hitting nearly 48 degrees while Carnarvon is reaching nearly 50, and still no mention of climate change. Still no reference to the devastating impacts it's having on our community at home in WA. Some members of the cabinet did at least make reference to the extreme heat, advising us to stay indoors, stay safe and stay hydrated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the harsh reality for millions of Australians is that staying indoors probably isn't an option or even can make things more dangerous. We have all heard countless reports of renters sweltering through over-40-degree conditions inside their homes. Tens of thousands of renters do not even have aircon in their homes, let alone the ability to pay the bills to turn it on to be able to manage these incredibly difficult heatwave conditions. I have heard many stories from community members of renters sleeping in soaking clothes so that they can get to sleep at night, or suffering heatstroke simply from trying to do mundane things like cook in their kitchen. No mandate or requirement for rentals to be air conditioned or properly insulated in Western Australia means that renters are forced to put up with dangerous climate conditions. Often in WA, where no-fault evictions still exist, renters are too scared to ask their landlord for help, or, if they do, their landlord simply refuses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in a climate emergency now, and the government must do more to protect our community. It can start by fixing broken rental laws. Across Australia we see nearly 2,500 heat related deaths every year and far more hospitalisations. The change in WA's rental laws can literally be the difference between life and death. Instead of helping our community in vital areas during this crisis—like health care, housing, education and the overall wellbeing of future generations, young people—the government chooses to put more and more money in the pockets of fossil fuel giants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the Labor government gave $11 billion in handouts to fossil fuel companies. Instead of funding the climate crisis, the government could choose to make going to the dentist free for every Australian. I ask the Senate: what kind of moral compass leads you to the decision that it is better to put $11 billion in the pockets of the climate criminals, of the corporations cooking the place, rather than spending that money making sure that every person in Australia can go to the dentist?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unconscionable that the Labor government is still paying out fossil fuel corporations in record-breaking numbers alongside these record-breaking rises in global temperature. Let me make this clear: we spend 14 times more in this country subsidising fossil fuels than we do putting money aside for Australia's Disaster Ready Fund. Corporations such as Woodside do not pay their fair share of tax yet are subsidised to destroy our environment and poison our climate. The bill is staring us all in the face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation passed by this parliament continues to fail to address the crisis. It is getting hotter and hotter and harder and harder to ignore the government's clear priority in choosing the profits of a few over the safety and health of the people they are supposed to represent. The very fact that the Prime Minister can fly from severe rainfall on the east coast to boiling temperatures on the west coast and still vote in support of upholding these abhorrent policies is exactly why people do not trust politicians. It is incredible how out of touch both the Liberal and Labor parties are.  It is no wonder that so many Western Australians and people across the country feel that the government no longer hears, that Canberra no longer hears, the cries for action from community groups across the nation as the earth literally cooks beneath our feet. They look up at the air-conditioned cabinet rooms and know very well that nobody in there is actually listening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the final moments of my adjournment speech, I want to make something very clear. We sit here in a parliament which was built and designed to be the physical manifestation and home of Australian democracy, inclusive and accessible to the people. The reality of the Australian Parliament House in 2024 is that it is not accessible to the 4.4 million disabled Australians that deserve to have their rights upheld and represented in this space and that have the same right as every other person to access this space, work in this space and be elected to this space. In 2024 the Australian Parliament House is an inaccessible workplace. The Jenkins review made it clear that much work is needed to enable this place to truly be accessible and inclusive to the people who vote for and elect members to pass laws in this place, and it is not an accessible workplace right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has committed to and commissioned an independent report, driven by the Australian Disability Network, to survey Parliament House and to report to the government every single one of the changes that are needed to make this place accessible—from the ramps that are needed to enable people to get around the place to enabling staff members, policy support people, workers, cooks, chefs and some 5,000-plus people that work in this building to do their job, let alone the thousands more who travel to Canberra to advocate on behalf of the community. That report was presented to the Department of Parliamentary Services secretary on 22 December. That report contained over 300 recommendations for change, and, in response to that report, the secretary has requested that the Australian Disability Network make different recommendations because the recommendations made apparently aren't practical. Disabled people will not sit by and allow another generation of folks to be shut out of this place. We will get that report, and we will reveal it to the public.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:03</span>):  One year ago, in front of the Iranian embassy, Hamid Sotounzadeh was violently assaulted by a member of the AFP, when all he was doing was exercising his right to peacefully protest. Just this last week, Hamid has discovered that the officer who committed that assault—an unprovoked assault in a public place while being filmed—will not face charges. The AFP has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A criminal investigation will not be pursued in relation to the AFP member involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They won't even do a criminal investigation of the matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apparently, a professional standards investigation has now been finalised, and it is 'now in the administrative phase'. The spokesperson for the AFP also said that the findings of the investigation will not be released publicly. How can we let this stand? Hamid is still in significant pain. He is still extremely distressed at this lack of action. He had his ribs fractured and his spinal disc damaged by this unprovoked assault by a member of the AFP when he was in a public place, exercising his right to peacefully protest. Indeed, none of that core information is even disputed by the other side, but the other side is the Australian Federal Police. They've done their internal investigation, and the outcome is what? In any other situation this unprovoked assault would surely be considered a sackable offence and a serious crime. But, instead, it's just swept under the carpet because it's the AFP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Hamid wanted to do was peacefully protest. He was standing in front of the embassy of Iran, raising concern about the death of Jina Mahsa Amini at the hands of the brutal regime over there. He shouldn't have been assaulted by the Australian Federal Police. They should've been protecting him. Having been subject to that assault, though, surely he deserved a fair investigative process. Surely he deserved a system that would take what happened to him—the violence and the injuries that he suffered—fairly assess it and deliver a measure of justice. But, let's be clear, whilever police investigate police, there will be no justice for Hamid or whomever else is relying upon some kind of accountability, and this vacuum of accountability allows misconduct to become the norm in police officers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want a further case of that, think about what's happening at the moment in New South Wales, where a police officer who has now been charged with brutal murder was, just 12 short months ago, investigated by police for tasering somebody in the face. Again, that was caught on film. Again, it was investigated by police. Police investigated police, and they let him keep his taser; they let him keep his gun. When will we acknowledge that it's not just one bad apple. Allowing that lack of accountability rots the whole barrel. It's time to end police investigating police.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coronial inquest into the death of Kumanjayi Walker has heard evidence that the Northern Territory police have an ingrained culture of racism. It's making front-page news now because of evidence that has come from former NT officer Zachary Rolfe. But, let's be clear, First Nations Territorians have been calling this out for years. Indeed, what we have heard from that officer in the last 24 hours should send a shiver down our spines. But the NT is not unique; officers in a Brisbane watchhouse were caught making the most sickening racist comments. There is page after page of them. I won't read them onto the record, so offensive are they to First Nations people. And do you know what? None of them got sanctioned. Why not? There was an internal investigation. What a coincidence! Police investigated police and said it was all fine. Something that in any other job would get you fired on the spot is not just excusable in Australian policing; it appears to be part of the culture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same in New South Wales, and there's is data to prove it. Data from the Redfern Legal Centre shows that, between 2018 and 2022, First Nations peoples were significantly overrepresented as victims of police violence. Of a total of some 28,800 recorded uses of force against people in New South Wales, 13,161 were against First Nations people. Forty-five per cent of the use of police violence was against just 3.4 per cent of the New South Wales population. Police systemically visit violence and abuse upon First Nations peoples, and whether it's in New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory or Western Australia, the story is the same across the country. Why am I saying this in the Senate? It's because, during 11 years as a New South Wales MP, I saw up close how state and territory police had such political control over governments. They're never held accountable by state or territory governments. If anything, governments pander to them with law-and-order politics, and the end result is that communities are less safe—much less safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time for the Albanese government, the federal government, to step up and take account of this plague of police violence and racism across the country and deliver a national response, not just be silent. It's the federal government, the Commonwealth government, that's a party to all of the treaties about Indigenous rights, about civil and political rights and about preventing torture. And what have we heard in all of these instances from the federal Attorney-General and the Albanese government? Not one word. When racism is normalised in police forces in territories and states across the country, something needs to be done. And silence is not an option.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the Albanese government unveiled the Navy surface fleet review, after it had gathered dust on the defence minister's desk for nearly six months. It seems like the only thing the defence minister changed during that time was the name of the review. The review itself, and the government response, is little more than a shopping list for Defence. Indeed, the same Defence leadership who've overseen failure after failure—multibillion-dollar failure on procurement—have been given, by defence minister Marles, access to billions more dollars to effectively piss up against a wall. Worse than that, they're expected not to just clean up the mess that they created, but they're now given—</span>

Each boat would effectively see millions of Australians get access to dental care. Seven billion dollars per boat—that's the same amount that it cost the US to launch a nuclear submarine, and we get a frigate for it! You couldn't make this stuff up!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But next time you can't drop your kids off to school, or you're talking to their teacher about the huge class size, or the classroom's not air-conditioned, think about the fact that this money that the Albanese government is spending on six frigates is enough to fix all of that and more. It's enough to fix pretty much any problem that you can fix with money. And so next time Labor cry poor, as they do, on how they 'haven't got the money' for public housing, they can't raise JobSeeker and they can't improve Medicare—but they can spend hundreds of billions of dollars on nuclear submarines and tens of billions of dollars on frigates, and not even put any of them in the water?—ask your Labor MP why that's the case.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:13</span>):  It's most 10 years since I gave my first speech in this place and I talked about my work as an activist on forests and climate and my hopes of what could be achieved in my time in the Senate. I said in my first speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My agenda for my time here is clear. I want to be able to look my grandchildren in the eye and tell them that it was during my time in the Senate that Australia turned the corner and legislated to begin the shift to a zero-carbon safe climate economy. I suggest some simple steps to start us off: set pollution reduction targets based on science; stop subsidising fossil fuels; create more jobs by boosting clean energy production and energy conservation; start closing coal-fired power stations; say no to new coal and gas exports; and make the big polluters pay for the damage they are doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am also hoping to deal with unfinished business and see our forest heritage protected. This means getting timber and woodchips from plantations, not native forests, and no burning of native forests in furnaces for energy. It means creating the Great Forest National Park just to the east of Melbourne. I am here in this parliament for the Leadbeater's possums that live there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, progress on these eminently sensible and essential aims has been pretty slow over the decade that I've been here. Domestically, we have seen the closure of some big coal-fired power stations over the decade, and clean energy production has increased, but we are nowhere near close to the hundred per cent renewable energy which is where we should be, and where we could have been if we'd set our minds to it 10 years ago. Inexcusably, we are still opening up new coal and gas mines for export and subsidising fossil fuels to the tune of $11 billion every year, and we are paying the price. The world is paying the price for our ongoing inexcusable addiction to fossil fuels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I flew out of Melbourne on Sunday night, smoke blanketed much of Victoria. There's an out-of-control fire in western Victoria that has burned 18,000 hectares and destroyed homes and property. Snow gums on the summit of Mount Cole in western Victoria have been severely burnt. The Mount Cole summit, a precious remnant alpine ecosystem in the west, has not evolved to cope well with fire, and those snow gums will probably die. Yes, trees are likely to regrow there, but it's unlikely to be alpine vegetation that regrows. So there is more loss of biodiversity, another loss to grieve, as the blowtorch of global heating continues to take hold of our planet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That fire is still burning out of control The forecast for tomorrow is for shocking weather. The warning from Emergency Management Victoria that was issued today is for extreme fire danger with temperatures in the high 30s, along with gusty winds of up to 80 kilometres per hour. My heart goes out to everyone who has lost a home and property, who is currently evacuating, who is worried for their own safety and the safety of their loved ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, fires like these have become more common in Australia and around the world over the last decade. They will become more frequent, more intense, more dangerous and destructive, along with more and more intense floods, droughts, heatwaves and cyclones. Sea level rise is making entire island nations uninhabitable, with associated lives lost, families and communities destroyed, and refugees needing to seek asylum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me list a few of the weather and climate records that have been broken just this month. Perth exceeded its record for consecutive February days above 40 degrees. Temperatures peaked at 41.7 on Thursday last week, taking the total to five days. The planet is on a trajectory to experience the hottest February on record—after a record hot January, December, November, October, September, August, July, June and May. In recent weeks it was on course for a period of temperatures that are a full two degrees higher than pre-industrial levels. The first half of February has been described as climatic history rewritten, not just because of the number of records being smashed but because of the extent to which they've been broken. Sea surface temperature records have been comprehensively smashed as ocean temperatures continue to rise. In the Atlantic, where strong hurricanes form, they've experienced temperatures as warm this February, which is the end of winter there, as are usually experienced mid-summer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last decade this place's track record on protecting our precious native forests is as underwhelming as it has been on taking serious action on carbon. Our precious native forests are inspiring, wondrous places and the massive carbon stores needed to soak up carbon if we are to have a chance of addressing the climate crisis. They are home to threatened or endangered species, First Nations cultural heritage and totem species. These forests are still being logged. In Victoria last year we had the good news that native forest logging would end. That was good news. It did not happen because of any action in this place; it happened because of the tenacious campaigning of staunch activists over decades. In Victoria, the good news, at least, is that we've got a chance of seeing the Great Forest National Park, which I talked about in my first speech, protected. Unfortunately, we still don't have a recovery plan for the wollert, or Leadbeater's possum. I have asked at every estimates over the 10 years I have been here. In estimates a fortnight ago I was told the recovery plan was 'this close', but we still do not have a recovery plan for Leadbeater's possum. It just shows the lack of priority that is being given to the protection of our threatened and endangered species.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But at least in Victoria we now know that our forests—other than some ongoing so-called salvage logging in western Victoria, which needs to end—will be protected. It's the same in Western Australia—our forests in Western Australia are also now going to be protected. But in Tasmania and New South Wales the carnage goes on. In January I visited a forest that was home to swift parrots, of which there are only about 600 left in the whole world, yet in the forests I visited there had been a blockade set up by the Bob Brown Foundation. There was a known swift parrot habitat. There was a wonderful tree and a swift parrot nest of the top of that tree that had swift parrots breeding in it, and yet there was still logging planned. Fortunately, there is now a Supreme Court injunction stopping the logging of that forest, but it shouldn't come to that. How is it we are destroying our forests—the homes of critically endangered species of which there are only 600, the fastest birds in the world—and yet the logging continues?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So much of the southern forests of New South Wales were lost in the Black Summer fires, and yet the logging continues. Recently we had the New South Wales EPA put a temporary stop to logging because of the endangered greater gliders. It was admitted that surveys were being done for them only during the daytime, when greater gliders are nocturnal species and come out at night, so surveying for them in the daytime is not very useful. The EPA put a temporary stop to that. Sadly, they are now going to allow the logging of that forest and forests all over to continue. They are no longer even going to pretend that they are surveying threatened species. Rather than doing inadequate daytime surveys, they're doing no surveys at all, with the excuse that they're going to protect a few more trees in the middle of logging coupes. This is not going to protect these threatened species, which are on a trajectory towards extinction. It is just appalling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I had the absolute delight of being in Tasmania in the Styx State Forest with our Tasmanian Greens leader, Rosalie Woodruff, and two of the candidates for the Tasmanian state election. We were in a magnificent area of forest with trees that were 80 metres tall, home to swift parrots, powerful owls and masked owls. It was an absolutely incredible forest, and, fortunately, this forest was protected. It was protected the last time that the Greens were in the balance of power in the state parliament. You need the Greens in parliament in order to protect forests—in this place, in the Tasmanian parliament and in the New South Wales parliament. Labor and the Liberals are on a unity ticket of continuing to destroy our forests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is hard not to feel despairing, but after 10 years I know that we just have to keep campaigning. We have to keep being resilient. We've got to mourn our losses, gird our loins and just keep on going, keep on working until we have a safe climate future, protecting our environment that we need.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Indigenous Australians and Assistant Minister for Indigenous Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:23</span>):  Like all Australians, I was horrified by the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israeli families on 7 October 2023. The hostages taken must be released. There is simply no excuse or justification for the atrocities that day; likewise, there is no excuse or justification for the wider use of civilian shields by any of the parties to the current conflict in Gaza and the West Bank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia joined more than 150 other countries in voting for a humanitarian ceasefire at the UN in December 2023. I have been meeting with Northern Territory constituents deeply moved by the retaliatory action of the Israeli defence force as it moves in to search and destroy terrorist elements and supporting infrastructure based in Gaza. My meetings have been with both supporters of the Palestinians and also the Jewish community here in Australia—teachers, doctors, mums and dads—who are all aghast at the trauma, as we are, and at the intergenerational aspects of the long-time conflict in the former Palestinian territories and homelands in Israel. The scale of the impact on the civilian population is frightening: 400,000 Palestinians suffering dire food shortages equals starvation and 1.7 million people in Gaza are internally displaced from their usual home—a place of safety and security that is surely a basic human need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most recently, representations from my constituents have put some difficult questions which I wish to put to the Senate: concern about the impact of the pause on part of our financial contribution to alleviate food shortages and starvation in Rafah through the UNRWA; steps Australia can take to increase pressure on those controlling land access to facilitate the transport of aid currently bottlenecked at border crossings into the communities of the Gaza Strip; steps Australia can take to force meaningful negotiations to finalise a sustainable two-state solution that aims to undo the intergenerational aspects of the history of conflict in this part of the Middle East; the potential for graduated economic sanctions against all aggressors not heeding our support for a peaceful future or operating outside of international law; a call to any Australian companies involved in the manufacture of military hardware used in that conflict to cease that support as a humanitarian gesture. In this regard, I note that Australia as a nation has not supplied weapons to Israel since the current conflict began and for the past five years. The unknown question of how intelligence gathered by Australians and our allies might be assisting to inform Israeli military action is another point that constituents have put forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A two-state solution that aims for peace in the Middle East has always been central to Australian foreign policy. Australia has been clear: there must be a two-state solution that brings a true peace and benefits the local population. We've certainly come to regard the current conflict as a failure of politics everywhere. It has recently been said that peacekeeping should seek to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, uphold international law and treaties, and promote social progress. In a similar vein, Senator Gallagher, in a speech to the G20 earlier this year, noted that the foundation for economic growth that lifts living standards is peace and stability. Australia is deeply alarmed by the conflict in the Middle East and the human catastrophe is worsening. The price of defeating Hamas cannot be the continuous suffering of all Palestinian civilians. Some wars are just a cover for genocide. We have seen this in conflicts over centuries. The International Court of Justice continues to consider that issue in the context of the current conflict in the Middle East. We have called on all parties to respect the findings of that judicial review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of a major ground offensive in Rafah, which is a place of refuge for large numbers of Palestinian refugees, we have been clear. We say to Israel: do not go down this path. Australia has a respected voice in this part of the world, and one way we maintain and use that influence is by ensuring that our aid is directed to support victims in conflict. We cannot say that is the case of the moment, after the self-declared irregularities with a small number of staff in UNRWA. UNRWA does life-saving work, but recent allegations against some staff are grave and need to be investigated. We applaud the early intervention of the UN in urgently cleaning out pockets of inappropriate behaviour in that organisation. While that review is underway, we have paused the $6 million earmarked for delivery through that agency, and 14 other countries have also paused their contributions. Australia is committed to providing aid where we can. Since 7 October, the Albanese government has provided $46.5 million in humanitarian assistance in the region. The situation is absolutely dire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on all our political representatives in Australia to work together to ameliorate the impact of this conflict on the innocents, particularly Palestinian children. I applaud the leadership of the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister Penny Wong in particular, and the Attorney-General in pursuing a humanitarian ceasefire and lasting peace built with a sustainable two-state solution. I also thank the Northern Territory constituents for their advocacy in pursuit for peace in the Middle East and for continually putting this issue at the forefront, in spite of all our own issues domestically in this country. I thank them for that.</span>

                  <a href="274506" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHARMA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:30</span>):  This is not my first speech. I want to talk this evening about some of the domestic consequences we're seeing of the conflict that Senator McCarthy just referred to. Regardless of your views on the rights and wrongs of the current chapter of the Arab-Israeli conflict, we should all be able to agree here that some of the attacks we've seen and some of the harassment and intimidation we've seen fellow Australians subjected to should never be acceptable and should never be seen in our society. We have seen in Australia, as has been well documented and now well chronicled, levels of antisemitism that we simply have never experienced before in our history. Sometimes I think that term can confuse people as to what it is they're seeing. Antisemitism is simply just another form of racism or discrimination on the basis of someone's ethnicity or religion. And, just as we would not tolerate racism or discrimination on religious or ethnic grounds in Australia directed at any community, we should be equally condemnatory of this particular manifestation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen, to cite just a few examples in recent weeks, a couple down in Melbourne, who I had the pleasure of meeting with last week, who were attempting to enter the Melbourne Town Hall for a debate on this issue being held at the Melbourne City Council chambers and were pushed and shoved to the ground by a rowdy crowd of pro-Palestinian protesters outside. We've seen a 72-year-old Jewish man assaulted in Melbourne after his attacker spotted Jewish items in the back of his car. We saw an incident with a man on a tram in Melbourne who was recorded telling another Jewish man that he would, 'Gun down 10,000 of you tomorrow,' if he had a machine-gun, and, 'I'm going to blow a hole through your synagogue.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Sydney we've seen food and a box decorated with swastikas thrown at a group of 13-year-old girls wearing school uniforms. We've also seen a terrible doxxing attack a few weeks ago, where the personal and identifying details—photos, addresses and business names—of 600 Jewish Australians were publicly disclosed, with messages that accompanied them suggesting that they should be harassed or menaced, that their businesses should be boycotted and that they should be made to feel unsafe in their own community. I ask you: would we tolerate this directed towards any other group of Australians? Would we think this is acceptable in a society that prides itself on both its diversity and its tolerance? I think not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was in Melbourne last week meeting with members of the Jewish community, I had several say to me something that I never thought I would hear Jewish people say here: 'We're beginning to talk about which country we should move to next.' Jewish Australians are feeling so unsafe that the historical fear that has plagued them as a people—the fear of being victims of a pogrom; of being exiled or, worse, subject to a form of genocide—is beginning to be felt in Australia. This is a collective failing on us all as Australians not only as leaders in our community or as elected representatives but also as the Australians who engage in this behaviour and the Australians who fail to speak up to condemn it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of whether you support Israel's actions or not, and I respect that there are different views, including here, on this issue; regardless of whether you think the Palestinian people have a right to self-determination or not, and I do; and, regardless of what you think of the historical rights and wrongs of a conflict that now dates back 75 years, we should all be able to agree as a matter of necessity, if not morality, that we should not be subjecting our fellow Australians to these sorts of attacks. What we are doing is tearing at the very fabric of our success as a multicultural society. And it's a rare success. It's not common for nations built of different groups of people from different religions and backgrounds to be able to forge a harmonious and successful whole. In Australia we've managed it, but only through careful nurturing and only through ensuring that our citizens are protected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do hope that we can all do more and can reflect on our own actions as we inevitably deal with the strong emotions and passions that this conflict can arouse and that, whatever our personal feelings on this, we can make sure that we do not seek to hold fellow Australians accountable for the actions that are taking place overseas.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:35</span>):  I want to put on the record how wonderful the first Parliamentary Friends of Dementia event for 2024 was. Today in this building we heard from wonderful advocates of this terrible disease. Tears were shared, laughs were had, and we were all taken aback by the dementia journey that many in that room were on. I would like to first put on record my deepest respect for the outgoing CEO of Dementia Australia, the inspiring Maree McCabe AM. I want to thank her for her inspiring leadership of Dementia Australia over many years. Maree, I wish you and your family all the very best for the future. I am wishing you health and happiness in your next chapter, wherever that chapter may be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge Professor Graeme Samuel for his contribution as the outgoing chair of Dementia Australia. What a fantastic advocate he was. The difference is that, when you've had a family member who has been on that journey of dementia, it gives you great passion and insight. So to both Maree and Graeme I say: thank you for everything you have done, and I know you will continue to advocate on this very important issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to welcome the new chair of Dementia Australia, Merran Kelsall AO. In welcoming you to the Parliamentary Friends of Dementia, I look forward to continuing the proud legacy of this group with you and to forging and continuing to develop a very strong relationship with you and to continuing that relationship with Dementia Australia, the pre-eminent organisation for helping all Australians with a dementia diagnosis and their families on the journey of dementia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's event was extremely important. Dementia Australia spoke to their budget submission. I'm very proud to be part of the Albanese Labor government, which, since coming to the office, has put dementia on the map. We are improving residential aged care, with better pay and conditions for those working in the aged-care sector, which gives that important care. It's so important that, when you get acknowledged through your remuneration, the workforce appreciates that confidence that you're placing in them; therefore, the care results do improve. We have a nurse 24/7 in over 99 per cent of residential aged care now across the country, and we're improving the food quality for residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also taking away the stigma that is associated with a dementia diagnosis. The more we can learn from people with the lived experience and from carers and loved ones who have cared for people living with dementia, the better we all are. This makes for better informed policy responses and care plans for Australians living with dementia and those who will be diagnosed going forward. We can all learn from one another, and it's important that we do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the event today we also heard from Dr Rowena Mobbs, who talked about CTE, which is a brain condition linked to repeated injuries or concussions which lead to dementia. It's often associated with trauma to the head and with people involved in contact sports, but it's not just contact sports. It's road trauma, it's domestic violence, it's cyclists and it's basketball players who have been affected by head trauma. It can be that knocking to the head—not just concussion, but the repeated knocking. In a domestic violence situation where a woman is being slapped around repeatedly, you can imagine that shaking of the head. We know how terrible it is when little babies die from being shaken by a perpetrator. It's just like that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also heard from the sporting great Wally Lewis AM, former Australian professional rugby player and better known, as I understand it, as 'the King'. I did confess, at the event this morning when I spoke, that I'm an AFL girl and I don't really understand that game, but I know who Wally is and I know what a great player he was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also on that panel today we heard from Lynn McGregor, Robin McGilligan and panel facilitator Pat Walsh, who informed us about what a CTE diagnosis means and what living with CTE means day to day. And I have to acknowledge Wally Lewis and those people who spoke on the panel. It takes a great deal of courage to open up and talk about the things that you are experiencing on a day-to-day level. And when you think of someone like Wally Lewis—and this happens to everyone, not just celebrities or great sportspeople—you become so vulnerable; you really do. You've had an inspirational life as a rugby league legend. He relived some of the embarrassments that he's been through, like the severe pain and the memory loss. In his workplace he was very fortunate because the television station has supported him all the way through. But when crossing from a live event—you're reading a script and then you go live—he couldn't remember whether he was at the beginning of the presentation, in the middle or at the end. This is what happens, and this was the beginning of the disease and how it's manifesting itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His short-term memory has left him, and he now relies on a daily diary, and he's so proud of that diary. He is very fortunate, because he has a very supportive partner and family to get him through those days. He advocated great education and understanding for those wishing to play a contact sport so that everyone understands the risks associated with continuing knocks to the head. And it's important, as he said, that you don't have this conversation with young players just after their first season; you have to continue to educate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to place on record my deep appreciation for the fact that Wally has taken on the role of our newest Dementia Australia ambassador. The story of the heartbreaking cycling accident which led Robin McGilligan to be diagnosed with probable CTE was also harrowing. This man had his life changed after a cycling accident that left him with severe headaches, confusion and anger behaviour. He changed from a competent corporate lawyer and a loving father to a man he didn't want to be.</span>

Senator McGrath made a ruling earlier because when we went to adjournment tonight there was not one senator on the five-minute list in the chamber, so he quite properly went to the 10-minute speakers and then reverted to the five-minute speakers. Senator Pratt has explained that. Senator Polley has the call. I'm going to give her the call.</span>
