         â€”Despite opinions expressed in recent times by coalition members, including the Treasurer (Mr Costello), as to the appropriateness of the Commonwealth being involved in education, there is no doubt that the Australian public expects our national government to ensure the proper education of our youth. After all, it is literally an investment in our future. It is unquestionably the main factor which will determine the destiny of our nation. You get education right or you go under as a nation.

        Australians specifically approved federal involvement in education in 1946 by approving an amendment to the constitution to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         include section 51(xxiiiA), which gives the Commonwealth the power to make laws with respect to the provision of benefits to students. In addition, section 96 of the constitution gives the federal parliament power in respect of the funding of states through tied grants.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is only in relatively recent times, however, that the Commonwealth government has become involved in the funding of education. The debate regarding Commonwealth funding became particularly heightened during the 1960s. During that time in particular, the extent of overcrowding in Catholic schools became public knowledge, as did the dilapidated state of buildings and the standard of teachers in those schools.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There was a realisation that Catholic schools in particular had very much become an integral part of the mainstream education system, catering for nearly one-fifth of students. Given the size of the Catholic school system and the fact that the Catholic school system had catered for students from all socioeconomic backgrounds for over a century, the argument became compelling that they should be assisted in undertaking the task of educating young Australians. Indeed, it was realised at that time that, if the Catholic schools released their students to the state system, it would have caused very real difficulties.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Commonwealth's first contribution to funding education was with the States Grants (Science Laboratories and Technical Training) Act 1964. But since the early 1970s the debate as to the appropriateness of state aid for non-government schools has become effectively a non-issue. All sectors have worked extremely effectively and cooperatively in the allocation of resources to educate our youth for the benefit of our nation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The current level of federal funding is such that we will be spending approximately $3.2 billion directly on schooling, with $1.8 billion going to non-government schools this year. The bulk of these funds will be paid as general recurrent grants, with $117 million going towards capital works funding.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A significant part of the cooperation that has developed over the years since the early
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         1970s has been in the nature of long-term planning through the new schools policy, which has existed since 1985. In order to establish a new school, those applying had to satisfy specific planning criteria. State planning committees, including representatives of government and non-government school authorities, provided advice to the Commonwealth as to whether the applications satisfied those criteria. Those which failed to satisfy the criteria were ineligible for Commonwealth funding.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It made sense that, in order to receive taxpayers' money, the applicant had to establish its viability and consistency with educational resources already allocated to the locality or the selection zone. Despite these requirements, the majority of applications succeeded. Some succeeded after consultations with other school authorities in the planning processes and mechanisms. In other words, those consultations assisted the applicants to get their acts together in order to get a school regime which was satisfactory and compatible with the rest of the state.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        By way of example, since 1985 about 95 per cent of applications from Catholic schools have satisfied the criteria. Have existing private schools suffered as a result of the new schools policy? The answer is clearly no, they have not. The non-government schools sector has grown substantially and has done so within a policy framework that promoted planning principles and procedures.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1995 a review of the new schools policy was established and chaired by Professor Ken McKinnon, a former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong and a former Chair of the Commonwealth Schools Commission. The committee reported in respect of the criteria which new schools should meet in order to be eligible for Commonwealth funding.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Those criteria included, very sensibly, the need to establish that the approval of the application will not have a significant negative educational impact on existing government and non-government schools in the catchment area of the proposed school. One would consider that that criterion is essential.
       </para>
       <break page="5496" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another criterion was that the proposal promotes rational and economic use of educational resources in the area. Unfortunately, the government's bill is a totally irrational and nonsensical approach to the funding of education. Literally, those criteria of rationality and forward planning have been thrown out the window by this bill. The main action proposed by the bill is:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . to the establishment and funding of non-government schools . . . The Bill abolishes the previous government's New Schools Policy from the beginning of 1997. This means that, from that time, those wishing to establish new schools will only have to satisfy minimum State/Territory registration requirements. As well, the current policy that restricts new non-systemic schools to Category 6 recurrent funding is to be removed. Under the new arrangements non-systemic schools will be able, if eligible, to access funding from the full range of categories.
        </para>
        <para>
         Again, that is eating into the overall education cake.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The abolition of the new schools policy reflects a complete lack of understanding of the need for complex and long-term planning to cater for changes in birth rate, immigration and population movements. It will have the effect of requiring public schools and the students and teachers to adjust continually to the effects of decisions made by unregulated private schools in receipt of substantial public funding but with no corresponding public responsibility for planning as currently exists.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The coalition has ignored the social responsibilities that should be attached to all schools drawing upon public funds. Access to the public purse should involve those responsibilities. The coalition's decision will ultimately promote disharmony between sectors and reopen the bitter and regrettably sectarian debate as to state aid for private schools. On the subject of choice of parents, as this government tends to have as its catchcry, the McKinnon review said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Growing cooperation among those involved in schooling, both government and non-government and teachers and parents, is unlikely to continue if these cutbacks persuade interest groups to think it is necessary to fight for a better share of a shrinking pool of schooling resources.
        </para>
        <para>
         In other words, choice is choice at an expense. The expense is going to be the loss of
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          cooperation and confrontation in respect of the diminishing school cake. For instance, it will mean that the cake has now to be spread, presumably, to include at least the 65 applications for new schools, which themselves plan to cater for 33,000 students. In other words, the funding blanket is going to be spread so thinly that it is itself going to be vulnerable to injustice and hardship, which will inevitably occur.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Many existing private schools, and indeed public schools, will find that they will have to introduce more composite classes as a result of the drain of students. Many courses currently taught may lose viability as a result of the lack of numbers. Basically the system will move from one which is based on forward planning and cooperation to one of Rafferty's rules. It allows anyone to set up schools without any real check on how it is going to affect the viability of those schools already operating in the area.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The coalition fundamentally intends by this bill to encourage the exodus of students from government schools to private schools. It intends to do that by taking money out of the public school system. The method of funding under the bill has been analysed by Louise Watson from the Australian National University. She notes:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Federal government provides an annual grant of $406 per student in government schools. In comparison, it provides an average grant of $2091 per student in non-government schools. Thus when a student moves from a government school to a non-government school, the Federal government saves $406, has to outlay $2091. The transfer of a student between sectors is therefore a net cost to the Commonwealth of $1685 per student.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is equivalent, in practical terms, to one desktop computer.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         If enrolments in non-government schools increase by 80,000 students over the next four years, as the government predicts, the net additional cost will be $150.4 million.
        </para>
        <para>
         However, the government plans to pay for that additional charge by taking money away from kids already in government schools. Louise Watson also notes:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The major offset will be obtained by cutting $1712 from the government schools' Recurrent Grants Program every time a student enrols in a non-

          government school. This offsetâ€”euphemistically entitled "the Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment" . . . is expected to recover about $128 million from government schools' recurrent funding . . .
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The second offset will be the average Federal grant of $406 per student saved from not funding a student in the government school, which will saveâ€”

         about $30 million over the four years.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Given the differences in Federal funding levels between government and non-government schools, the reduction of $2118 will not be a one-for-one adjustment in per student funding.
        </para>
        <para>
         As Louise Watson points out, effectively every time a government student moves to a non-government school, it will mean a reduction in federal funding equivalent to an extra four students in government schools. That, quite simply, is an outrage.

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         Right under our noses, the government school system is being privatised, but few seem to realise or care. With all the attention on Telstra, the Federal Government's changes to school funding have escaped debate. Yet they are as radical as anything proposed for the phone company.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is radical at the expense of kids in government schools. To continue:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The quality of government schools, already suspect, will surely deteriorate with the projected 25 per cent cut in Federal funding over four years. The Feds provide, it is true, only 13 per cent of State school funding, but $150 million is an amount the hard&amp;hyphen;pressed system can't afford to lose.
        </para>
        <para>
        </para>
        <para>
         But there is a bit in it for everyoneâ€”that is, except the kids in government schools and the teachers who are trying to do their best for them with the resources that they have. In his second reading speech on 19 September, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) referred to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the fact that it is cheaper for the government to educate children in private schools than in government schools. He outlined how the government intends to hold back 50 per cent of net recurrent savings to a state or territory from students shifting from government to non&amp;hyphen;government schools. The government is not content merely to strip the public school system; it is sending in the looters to finish the job.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Those funds they withhold should immediately be allocated to the public school education system. The government's gutting of the public education system by the measures contained in the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996 is in addition to the huge cuts to untied grants to the states announced at this year's Premiers Conference. Those cutsâ€”$1&amp;half; billion over three yearsâ€”equate to about $300 million in reductions to the states' discretionary funding for schools.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Moreover, it is a gross misrepresentation to suggest that the government's literacy program is a creation of this government. The program was introduced by Labor in the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) in 1995 and it was based on the 1991 white paper,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australia's language: the Australian literary and language policy

         , and the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training report,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The literacy challenge

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition, the students with disability program was again a creation of the Labor government, in the 1995 bill. But, in respect of that later program, it has been noted that there is another broken promise to students with disabilitiesâ€”one of the most educationally disadvantaged groupsâ€”with the Howard government's commitment to increase funding to those students by $16&amp;half; million being abandoned.

That will be a very great tragedy in Australia's historyâ€”a very great tragedy indeed.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I am reminded of reports from a member of the government who said that the fact that students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds were more prevalent in universities suggested that children from such backgrounds were more intelligent. Those statements to that effect are to be condemned. There is no such thing as inherited intelligence. Unfortunately, there is such a thing as inherited disadvantage. This government is doing nothing whatsoever about inherited disadvantage. Education is the one area where society can be evened up. It is the one area where opportunities can be redressed and made a little more equal.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This government is winding the clock right back. It will be only those children from more well&amp;hyphen;off families that are going to access those schools with the majority of resources. Those schools, under this government, will be the private schools. The public school system is being laid to waste by this government. It is being turned into something which is residual and, unfortunately, second class. This is one of the most unfortunate bills the government has brought into the House since it was elected to office this year.

        The State Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill provides some specific funding details, the lion's share of which will go to government schools on the basis that this is where those particular funds are needed most. But without doubt the one area which has been most warmly welcomed has been the move by this government to provide a direct working and training link between secondary schools and business with an eye to generating more apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities for those people who choose not to immediately pursue tertiary education.

        A few days or so before the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training arrived in Townsville, I happened to catch the end of a radio talkback interview a local station was conducting with a senior board member of the Townsville Chamber of Commerce. A question was raised about apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities in society to which the chamber of commerce member said that it was an avenue of employment opportunity which had been neglected for so long by successive governments at both state and federal levels that centres such as Townsville had a chronic lack of young tradespeople and specialists. This is certainly the case in the industry I come from where it is very difficult indeed to get young people to join the industry.

        Under the previous government, apprenticeships fell to their lowest level in 30 years. This is disgraceful. This government is 100 per cent committed to turning this around.

        I do not think anyone in this House would dispute the need to address the problem of illiteracy in society. In his second reading of this bill, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) described illiteracy as `the worst form of poverty' and `a blight on our society'. It is a blight on our society, and a needless one at that. It is difficult to imagine that a person can go through years and years of primary and secondary school teaching and come out at the end with literacy and numeracy skills that are either inadequate or next to being non-existent. But it does happen. It has been estimated by some that the whole problem of illiteracy costs Australia anywhere between $3,000 million and $6,000 million a year. This too is a needless cost.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I guess that one of the biggest problems in the fight against illiteracy is the number of different and conflicting theories surrounding how best to approach the teaching of literacy skills. Some people advocate the use of phonicsâ€”the sounding out of written wordsâ€”as the best tool to teach people to read. Others again say that this approach is not a universally good teaching method as not all words sound the way they appear on paper. Some blame teachers and schools for not putting enough time into actual literacy studies, and others that children are being overwhelmed by a myriad of different subjects and that it is not the teachers' fault at all.

Some 9,000 students from 450 primary schools throughout Australiaâ€”4,500 year 3 students and 4,500 year 5 studentsâ€”took part in this survey. According to the minister's press release, the survey assessed a range of skills including reading, writing, speaking, listening and viewing skills. Results from the survey are expected early in 1997 and will form a significant part of establishing Australia's first national literacy goalâ€”that is, establishing certain national literacy benchmarks for year 3 and year 5 students and ensuring that every child leaving primary school can read and write to an appropriate standard. I look forward to that report being presented. The coalition's benchmark proposal also has the cooperation of the state and territory governments. This national approach to tackling illiteracy as a problem is a first for Australia, and a long overdue one at that.

        The last point I turn to in relation to this bill is the languages program. This bill has given priority to Asian languages, and with good reason. Despite what Pauline Hanson thinks, Australia depends on Asian markets for the vast majority of its trade. South-East Asia is a dynamic and growing region, and Australia is in a good position geographically to take full advantage of this. Certainly my electorate, based in Townsville, is very well positioned in this country to take advantage of the supermarket to Asia strategy recently introduced by the government.

Far from stealing our jobs, increased trade and interaction with this region will stimulate employment and economic growth in North Queensland.

         â€”The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill now before the House contains measures that will have a profound effect on the provision of public and private education in this country for many years to come. By abolishing the previous Labor government's new schools policy, by giving new non&amp;hyphen;government schools access to higher levels of recurrent funding and by giving all non-government schools access to recurrent funding for new students, the government has ensured a further expansion of non-government schools in Australia, and that is likely to be at the expense of the public education system in this country.

        I am not sure whether all members of the Howard government's backbench fully understand the dimensions of the long-term changes to education in Australia that are foreshadowed by this coalition bill. They ought to take some time to reach that understanding because this bill will have a profound effect on the provision of a quality public education to the sons and daughters of the majority of their constituents.

        For over a century Australia has built one of the best public education systems in the world. It has been that public education system that has underpinned the economic and social progress of this nation throughout the 20th century. The public education system has given the sons and daughters of working people access to personal, economic and social opportunities. It is that quality public education system that stands to be most affected and diminished by this legislation now before the House.

        Primary and secondary education in Australia has traditionally been the responsibility of state and territory governments. However, since the Second World War, and more particularly since the 1960s, we have seen a
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         greater Commonwealth funding involvement in these areas of education. This process began in 1946 with amendments to the Australian constitution after a referendum which expanded Commonwealth power under section 51 of the constitution and extended Commonwealth involvement in the education area. The Commonwealth has also used section 96 of the constitution to grant `financial assistance to any state on such terms and conditions as this parliament thinks fit'. That led in 1964 to the process of direct Commonwealth aid to the non-government sector.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The expanded role of the Commonwealth in funding non-government schools was not without vigorous debate within both the major political parties of this country and the general community at the time. It was a very divisive and sectarian debate, and it raged for some time on the issue of state aid to non-government schools. It is that debate, sadly, which will be revived over time by this bill now before the House.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The essence of that debate at the end of the day acknowledged two key propositions as far as primary and secondary education in Australia were concerned. The first was that the state had a responsibility to ensure access to and the viability of a sound public education system in Australia. The second acknowledged the right of the non&amp;hyphen;government sector to exist and to be supported by the national government to ensure that adequate educational standards are promoted and maintained throughout the education sector in this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Labor in government was able to get that delicate balance pretty right and, while the principle of choice was upheld and expanded, the public education system was supported and the cherished principle of children having access to a decent and quality education regardless of race, religion or political belief was upheld also and promoted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are several elements of this bill that are of particular concern to the opposition and they raise serious questions about the future of public primary and secondary education in this country. The foremost change directed by the bill is the abolition of the previous Labor government's new schools policy. That policy
        <break page="5502" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         was originally introduced to provide a planning framework for the establishment of new schools and to preserve in an area the viability of existing educational infrastructure. While there have been some criticisms directed at this policy from very narrow and sectional interests from time to time, it has provided a fair and equitable way of guiding the development of new educational facilities in this country.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The abolition of that policy by this government alters radically the dynamics and the overall parameters that guide the establishment of new educational institutions in various communities throughout the length and breadth of this country. This bill will allow any group to set up a new school as long as it satisfies very minimum state and territory registration requirements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The implications of this particular policy are twofold. It will further stimulate the movement of students from the government to the non&amp;hyphen;government sector. The effect of this will be to weaken the viability of government schools and undermine the viability of some non&amp;hyphen;government schools as well.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill also effectively dismantles the planning framework that has prevented the undue fragmentation within the educational sector and offers the prospect of eventually diminishing curricula offerings in established non&amp;hyphen;government and government schools in particular communities. Another significant change which is outlined in this bill provides non&amp;hyphen;systemic schools, if eligible, to access funding from the full range of categories.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The sting in this bill for the public education system in this country lies in the manner in which the government intends to finance the changes to primary and secondary educational funding through this bill. It proposes to do this through its enrolment benchmark adjustment. Simply put, the Howard government intends to fund this expansion by taking money out of the public school system. To put it even more simply, for every new student who moves to a private school from January 1997, the Howard government will cut its funding for four government school students.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is indeed a very dangerous policy in social terms. It will lead to further movement of students from the public school system and it will eventually lead to a massive run-down of that sector in this country. Effectively, this means that the quality of public schools will diminish even further as funding is cut by, we estimate, some 25 per cent over the next four years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There has already been a significant shift of students from the government to the non&amp;hyphen;government sector in Australia. Enrolment in non&amp;hyphen;government schools in 1983 stood at 24.4 per cent. In 1995 that had increased to 29 per cent, one of the highest levels in the OECD industrialised countries. Since 1988, for example, the growth in enrolments in non&amp;hyphen;government schools has been in the order of 9.3 per cent while government enrolments have only increased by 0.5 per cent.

         On the question of funding of private education in Australia compared with other Western countries, the OECD reported in 1992 that an analysis of the level of public subsidies to private education in 12 industrialised countries ranked Australia as the fourth highest level in granting subsidies to the private sector.

         What do the general community and general commentators on education think about the bill that we are debating in the House today? I want to quote to the House the views of a recently formed group called the Australian Schools Lobby which has very prominent educationalists associated with it. It said that the bill before the House will `fundamentally change the structure of Australian schooling without consultation or public debate'. That is what this government is really on about, changing the nature of primary and secondary education in this country, substantially withdrawing funding from the public education sector and transferring it to the private education sector and doing it without adequate public debate and without consultation with the most important constituencies in that educational community. This is what the Australian Schools Lobby had to say about these changes:

         This is a government that prides itself on trying to achieve budgetary efficiencies and some degree of fiscal responsibility.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian Schools Lobby went on further with very strong language about the enrolment benchmark adjustment, which underpins the government's transference of money from the public education system to the private education system. They had this to say:

         As I have already outlined, the changes in this bill, especially the abolition of the new schools policy, will exacerbate that movement from the public to the private education sector in this country. This will result in a fall in the educational capital which is available to government schools. They will increasingly become schools for the poor and in the end may very well become ghetto schools. This is in no-one's interestâ€”not in the government's interest, not in the opposition's interest, not in the interests of the wider community of this country. Any move in this direction ought to be opposed on both equity and social justice grounds. Education must be firmly based on a strong public sector, open to all and repre

         Another problem that is associated with this bill will be the establishment of new schools in areas already well served by government and non-government schools. This will result in massive wastage of resources. It is madness to have existing structures in which the community has invested considerable resources over the years standing underutilised while at the same time allocating Commonwealth moneys to new educational enterprises in communities.

         The right of parents to have a choice of education available is not denied, but it is not unlimited. It is economically sensible that the choice of the range of educational options to be made available in any community should be made early in the development phase of any new community. The range of schools should generally be established as a community grows and thereafter should not change much, except in exceptional circumstances.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There is also a danger that a significant number of the expected explosion in new schools will represent a very  narrow range of sectional and religious interests. In the past, the educational offering made by such groups has often been very narrow and even quite discriminatory, for example, against women. There is no guarantee that the registration processes in some states will provide sufficient safeguards against the establishment of second-rate educational institutions.

While we were in government, there was a strong recognition by Labor of the special problems and the need to lift the standards of outcomes in certain areas of education. In 1994-95 we provided substantial funding to overcoming illiteracy.

        Research indicates that as many as one in five children cannot read and write adequately when they finish school. I find those statistics absolutely appalling. We do have a quality education system, as the previous speaker said, yet that system is failing up to 20 per cent of our students. If we do not teach them to read and write adequately at school, then we are literally sending them off to join the dole queue.

        If they have no literacy skills, if they cannot take down a simple phone message, read an occupational safety sign, fill out a job application, read the newspapers or job boards for vacancies, then they have limited job opportunities available to them. If they do not manage to find a job within a year of leaving school, they face a very real prospect of becoming long-term unemployed. This frequently leads to anger, frustration, depression and all sorts of other social problems. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released in August show the youth full&amp;hyphen;time unemployment rate at 27.1 per cent. In some parts of my electorate of McEwen youth unemployment is as high as 40 per cent.

        One of the ways in which we as a society can help to address the youth unemployment problem is by ensuring that students finishing school to join the work force can read, write and communicate at a suitable level. The previous Labor government certainly did precious little to address the youth unemployment problem during its 13 years in power. In fact, when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was minister for employment, Australia's unemployment rate reached its highest level since the Great Depression, and youth unemployment nationally reached a level of just over 32 per cent.

        When addressing the literacy problem, we as a government must ensure that the unique challenges of providing literacy services to rural communities in particular are addressed. Research shows that literacy problems are higher in some rural areas, particularly where isolation, limited job opportunities and poverty can be a disadvantage. Throughout my electorate, a number of adult and community education centres run adult literacy programs in the community or act as a referral point for courses in neighbouring towns.

        From speaking with these groups, I understand that there are three major obstacles facing literacy program providers in rural areas: first, public awareness of literacy programs; second, access to those programs; and, third, the social stigma which continues to surround the problem of illiteracy. Most people with literacy problems in rural areas do not know about the programs available to help them because they do not live in the world of print. They cannot read pamphlets, newspaper articles or community notice boards which may publicise availability of literacy programs. Television and radio are the best method of communication, but this is costly and can be difficult for many in rural areas to access.

        Access to centres which provide literacy programs is another hurdle which is difficult to overcome for country people. It has taken the efforts of this government to begin to correct that.

         In many small rural communities, people with literacy problems are either too shy or embarrassed to seek help because of the stigma which surrounds their problem. Morrison House is a community centre which provides literacy programs to young people and adults in the Yarra Valley, in my electorate of McEwen. The centre has offered to provide courses to many towns in McEwen, such as Healesville. However, it has been found that local residents prefer to travel to other towns to attend classes where they are not known.

I am proud to say that this is yet another promise which the coalition is delivering in full. The strategy aims to ensure that every child develops at least adequate literacy and numeracy skills by the end of year 3 by focusing on children who need extra support.

         The responsibility for literacy does not belong with governments alone. Parents have an important role to play in the literacy of their children by reading with their children at home, supervising homework, encouraging conversation and helping to develop life skills, particularly as it is believed that most of our learning happens outside the classroom. Our educators must also play their part in helping to provide literacy standards. It is vital that the basic fundamental skills of reading, writing and communicating are achieved and developed during the first years of schooling.

I believe it must also be recognised that many people with literacy problems have those problems because they did not learn the usual way in the school system. As Jan Simmons states:

This is a very significant piece of legislation. It provides funding security for Australian government and non-government schools for the next four years. It increases funding by some 17 per cent to government and non-government schools. One would have to say that this is an excellent outcome for Australian schools and Australian students.

        I thank members who have participated in this debate for their very thoughtful contributions. I instance particularly the government members who have referred to the fundamental importance of literacy for Australian students. In the view of the government, lack of literacy and numeracy skills are perhaps the greatest educational disadvantage that any student can suffer. If they fail to acquire these skills in the course of their schooling years, particularly, as the member for McEwen has just mentioned, in the early years of schooling and the first three years of schooling, the chances are that they will be disadvantaged for life.

        Therefore, our literacy emphasis and literacy programs are a key element of the government's approach to equity in education. We hear the use of the term `equity' from the other side of the House on many occasions. Yet when we review the record of the last 13 years and listen to this debate, we cannot help but come to the view that they have absolutely no idea what equity in education really consists of. If students do not have educational programs which provide them with the fundamentals on which they can build their lives, they have been treated most unfairly. We have just been through a period of 13 years where no progress whatever has been made in the solution to the literacy program. It was a government that refused to measure literacy outcomes. There have been no significant measures of literacy outcomes for the last 16 years until this government introduced the first national English literacy survey.

         In many ways, this debate is quite a historic debate.

We have seenâ€”and I will demonstrate this by going through the details of what the opposition speakers have put before the Houseâ€”the utter confusion, the inaccuracy and the damaging nature for public schooling in this country of the proposals which are being put forward by way of amendment in this debate by the opposition speakers.

Let me now go through and detail the errors, the misconceptions, the confusion and the failure to learn from experience of the shadow minister for education and youth affairs at the table, the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin), and the colleagues behind him who have spoken in this debate.

It is new money to encourage vocational education programs in schools, money that would not otherwise have been available to Australian schools to encourage them to offer relevant programs for the 65 per cent of students who are not going on to university or full&amp;hyphen;time TAFE and who are dropping out of school and going onto the unemployment queues because of the complete failure of the previous government to put in place programs that would offer assistance to these students. So much for the empty rhetoric of equity that we hear from the other side.

It never advocated policies that would give the government school sector the flexibility and the capacity to adjust. It never argued for policies that would demonstrate the quality in the government school sector to parents. It allowed a black market in imperfect information to exist among parentsâ€”a whispering campaign perhaps that distorted the quality in the government sectorâ€”because it would never measure outcomes. It simply refused to allow the government schools to give information to the parents about the quality of the education that was occurring in that sector.

         Let us look at the policy that the Labor Party still supports. Its policy sought to restrict parental choice.

         This was another inequity in this policy because it damaged most children from low income families. We have removed that.

          The average saving for state governments when a pupil moves from a government to a non-government school is $3,400. The Commonwealth is saying to the states, `You have, over the last decade or so, made savings of the order of $3 billion as a result of this outflow.' Listen to this, Shadow Minister: the states have had, under your policy, a very big incentive to shift students from government to non-government schools. I do not know whether that incentive has influenced their policies, but it may have, because it is a very big financial incentive under your policies.

The fact is that the per capita funds remaining for every government school student as a result of this policy actually increase. There is more funding per student for every government school student after the result. There is more funding, and that greater funding allows the government school sector to improve the quality of what it offers to its remaining students. It is a stabilising factor in the flow. Think it through clearly. You are utterly confused on this point, and your proposed amendments will be quite counterproductive.

            â€”They are utterly myopic in their ability to really address the issues of disadvantage, inequity and injustice. They are the kinds of friends who have actually damaged over the last 10 years government schooling in this country. They want to increase the outflow. They want to double the position in this legislationâ€”the incentive for state governments to cost&amp;hyphen;shift. I urge them to rethink this nonsense before they reiterate it in the Senate.

           They also, apparently, do not like the decision of the government to dismantle the bureaucracy of their new schools policy to which they are emotionally devoted. They say that, if we do so, we will somehow or other erode the capacity to plan the development of education. In this legislation there is a strategic judgment by the Commonwealth government. We do not intend to micromanage Australia's school systems.

           The states have full capacity to plan the development of the schooling systems in their states. The responsibility for granting registration to new schools exists in the states. It lies with the states, not the Commonwealth. It is a matter for the states to consider whether planning for new schools is required. Australian taxpayers do not need to pay for the Commonwealth to come in and try to perform

            the functions that the states have got a full capacity to perform. That is the level of government which is actually running the school systems. The rest of the amendments we are seeing put forward by the opposition in this debate simply reconstruct this old musty bureaucracy which failed to achieve the objectives that they wanted, which was to prevent this flow between the government and the non-government sector.

         There are two major aspects which the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has referred to in his summing up speech. The first amendment seeks to preclude the government from cutting $128 million from government schools through the minister making a determination under the act to pay less than that prescribed by the formula. We heard some extraordinary logic from the minister here today. The unambiguous reality is that the effect of our amendment is to provide $128 million extra for government schools. That is the difference that it makes. No amount of carrying on by the minister can disguise that reality.

         It is interesting to hear the minister rationalise his position. I stand by everything I said in my speech during the second reading debate. Every point that the minister made was demonstrably rebuttable. It is interesting to see the points that he fails to address himself to. I made the point about the reduction in FAGs that has been imposed on the states on top of which this is a further impost.

         He talks about this windfall that the states have had over the years in terms of this enrolment shift. If you are going to talk about that, you cannot divorce that consideration from a broader consideration of what has happened to general revenue assistance to the

          â€”Well, you are trying to say that there has been a windfall; what I am saying is that it is not possible to argue that there has been that sort of windfall. The minister also says that per capita funding of government school students is going to improve. The other point that he does not address is the fact that these savings, which are said to be realisable as a result of that shift from the government to the non-government sector, are based on an average cost comparison. That is simply not relevant for this particular purpose. The New South Wales state governmentâ€”as I am sure he would be awareâ€”claimed that it will end up out of pocket on the basis of that adjustment alone, without even factoring in the FAGs adjustment on top of that.

         I stand by every proposition I put forward in my speech during the second reading debate. The amendments I have moved in this context relating to planned educational provision and trying to restore a semblance of that into the policy draw to a considerable extent on the review of the new schools policy carried out by Professor McKinnon. There are some elements drawn from the guidelines that previously existed. Some substantial elements, particularly the overall philosophy of what we are seeking to do, draw heavily on what Professor McKinnon had to say.

         The amendments we have moved here today are complex. The government will no doubt vote them down in this chamber.

No doubt we will make some drafting alterations as a result of that. As a result of consultation, we may choose to make some substantive alterations to what we have put forward here.

Let him go back to the states after his government has already imposed a $1.5 billion FAGs reduction and tell them what a terrific thing it is that they think they have had this great windfall. Now, as a result of that, they are in a position to sustain a further $128 million cut in the funding available for government schools.

        I pointed out to the shadow minister that the effect of his amendment is actually to double the incentive for state governments to move students into non-government schools.

        He talks about a cut of $128 million to government school funding. What he is referring to is a sum of money which is half the total windfall gain to state governments as a result of projected movements over the next four years between the sectors. Those movements may or may not occur, but what he is saying is this: that Australian taxpayers should be funding students in schools they do not attend. He is opposing the position of the government that we should fund students where they are, that funds paid by governments for education should actually go to the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         schools where the students are being taught. What he is saying is that, although a student has left the system, the funding for the system should be left there. That is what he is saying.

        This again shows the utter confusion. This is not a cut to government school funding. In fact, government school funds for the students in the system increase as a result of this policy. Dollars for every student in the government school system grow as a result of this. There is every opportunity for government schools to improve the quality of education, to cut the flow and to stabilise the situation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under our policies, they will have the flexibility to do that. They will be in a position to tell their communities what the quality of the education is that they are offering to students. They could never do that under the previous government. That is why we are working so closely with the government primary and secondary school principals, whom the previous government never spoke to. They were so busy discussing it with their mates in the education unions that they forgot the people who were the leaders of the schools.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition is not a defender of the government schools. This side of the House, the Howard government, is the defender of government schools, because we are putting in place policies that will produce real quality in the government school sector. We do not have a bias between government and non-government schools. We will fund parents where they send their children. If they send them to the government schools, we will fund them there. If they send them to the non-government schools, we will fund them there.

        What we want to see is quality education for every Australian child. What we are hearing from the other side of the House is nothing more than the know nothing, narrow ideology that has dominated education policy in the Labor Party for the last 13 years, which is nothing more than an expression of the narrow institutional interests of the unions who support the Labor Party and who trot out their ideological compatriots to try to present themselves as if they are defenders of the system. If they knew how to defend the

Why are they now moving amendments which will double the incentives for the states over and above this legislation to actually move students from the government schools into the non-government schools? We have never seen such appalling confusion.

        What this historic debate is demonstrating is the difference between the government on this side of the Houseâ€”which is prepared to look at the facts and register them and do something to provide quality education for all Australian studentsâ€”and the narrow factional institutional ideology that has dominated policy in the Labor Party when it was on this side of the House for the last 13 years.

        The states have realised very substantial savings. It is quite true that there is a variation between the states in their capacity to realise savings. Do not think the New South Wales governmentâ€”which has failed to give its public schools the flexibility to respond effectivelyâ€”has not grizzled to us about its incapacity, because of the bureaucrat regulations it has in place, to fully realise the savings. Of course the New South Wales government has made that point to us. It should get on with reform and help the public schools, the government schools, adjust to the realities of the choices that parents are making.

         The New South Wales government have apparently provided the opposition with a paper on the cost implications of these measures. The paper shows that the current arrangements result in windfall savings of $24.5 million a year to New South Wales for a two per cent shift in enrolments between the sectors. The New South Wales government are fully in a position to realise savings on the flows. They can say what they like to the opposition. We know that the Trades and Labour Council there are reading the riot act on an almost weekly basis to Mr Aquilina, the New South Wales minister, on his policies for education and training.

Let me point out that Ms Watson has incorrectly, I am advised, measured the absolute increase in estimated non&amp;hyphen;government enrolments. Firstly, the enrolment benchmark adjustment is calculated on the proportionate shift, recognising that a share of the estimated increase in school enrolments

         Secondly, Ms Watson is wrong in saying that the enrolment benchmark adjustment will increase the incentives for cost shiftingâ€”a point, I understand, acknowledged even by the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) when she referred to cost pressures that have caused states to push students to non&amp;hyphen;government schools. This is a matter on which I have already made a number of remarks in the course of this debateâ€”remarks which reveal the nonsense of the amendment being proposed by the opposition.

         The member for Fremantle also referred to the shift to non&amp;hyphen;government schools as having the potential to siphon the elite and accelerate the push toward non&amp;hyphen;government schools. The fact is that my department estimates that by 1999 some 2,200,000 students will be in government schoolsâ€”some 69 per cent of school enrolmentsâ€”and that these students will be receiving quality education. This can hardly be categorised as `residualisation', one of the fresh new concepts that has been thrown into this debate by the left&amp;hyphen;wing allies of the shadow minister at the table and the Australian Education Union. The government sector has been residualised when 70 per cent of students are there! We are putting in place in this legislation policies that will provide for quality education.

         â€”Let me try to explain a very simple point to the shadow minister. He is saying that we should leave with the states the full average saving of $3,400 per government pupil when the pupil moves to the non&amp;hyphen;government sector instead of the $1,700 that we are actually leaving with them because of the enrolment benchmark adjustment. So we have got fewer pupils and, for every pupil who has moved out of the system, there is an additional $1,700 million. Admittedly it is not the full $3,400, but it is $1,700. Let us spread that $1,700 amongst all the remaining pupils in the government school sector. That is more per capita than existed before the shift. There are additional dollars there for every government school student. Rather than cutting spending for government school students, there are in fact more funds in the state coffers to provide for those students.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That sum of money has another role in the system as well. It is also an incentive to the states because they can make that saving and, of course, the state treasuries can come in and take that saving if they want to. The state treasuries have got twice the incentive to costshift to the Commonwealth and move students into the non-government schools if the figure is $3,400, which is what the shadow minister wants it to be. We would like that figure to be $1,750, and we would like to see that money go from the states to improving the quality of government schooling in the states.

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         So his argument that government school students are worse off is utterly fallacious. There are more funds there as a result of the financial consequences of that shift and the savings the states make, but he wants to double the incentive for the states to costshift. We saw the effect of that during the period the Labor Party was in government. The flow from the government to the non-government schools actually sped up under the policy it put in place to slow it down. The policy was totally ineffective.

        <para first-indent="16">
         His solution, because the unions tell him that and because it is left&amp;hyphen;wing ideology, is to put all the bureaucracy back into the legislation, to do the same thing again. They tried it for 10 years and it did not work. He now wants to put it back and do it again. He fails to address the need for reform in the government school sector to provide the government schools with greater flexibility, to respond to parents' choices, to provide them with the diversity they want.

         He never put in place, and does not now propose to put in place, policies to encourage them to publish their outcomes in a way in which parents can see the quality of the education that is being offered in the government schools.

They did none of these things. There were no amendments to actually help build up the government school sector, to equip it to address this issue of the flow.

         No, they are only interested in one thing: putting in place the bureaucracy, putting back the regulations, dipping again into the taxpayers' hand to duplicate state functions at the Commonwealth level. Ultimately, why? It is because the misguided people behind themâ€”the unions and their left&amp;hyphen;wing matesâ€”who think that in some way they are defending the government schools by this, want these policies. They have established lobby groups now to put them into place and to defend them before the Senate.

         â€”Yes, I think that is right. It is very convenient and easy to fill up some speaking time by retreating into hollow rhetoricâ€”and it is, indeed, hollow rhetoric. In the next few months the minister will find himself receiving an inundation of representations from parents and teachers. Those teachers may or may not be members of the relevant teachers unions. I am not sure of the union coverage of teachers in public schools,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          but I think he will find that the representations come from both teachers who are and teachers who are not members of unions. To typecast the fact that concerns are either left-wing motivated or trade union motivated is shallow and offensive.

        The fact of the matter is that in his second reading speech in this House the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), on behalf of the minister now in the House, stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Against this background, the government has decided to preserve for the Commonwealth 50 per cent of net recurrent savings to a state or territory from students shifting from the government to the non&amp;hyphen;government sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is preserving for the Commonwealth, preserving for consolidated revenue. There is no suggestion that the 50 per cent so preserved will be redirected into the public education system. Indeed, that is the thrust of these amendments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If one were to read the minister's comments in this debate, one would assume that was to be the intention; that is, that the 50 per cent preserved would be redirected to public education. If that is the intention, it should be made clear in the billâ€”and it most certainly has not been made clear in the bill. Indeed, from the second reading speech, it will be preserved for consolidated revenue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe the minister can anticipate that in the coming months he will be receiving many representations from other states when they find out the effect this bill will have on them. Of course, a state government cannot make a saving every time a student moves from the public sector to the private sector. They will still need to maintain their infrastructure. Just because a class size reduces from 29 to 28 does not mean that you sack the teacher. But it will mean that there are more composite classes. It will mean that there is a reduction in classes offered, as a number of courses will have to be discontinued. It will mean the removal of a number of additional benefits which help kids in public schools to adjust in many ways. For example, access to sporting and physical education facilities may have to be removed.

        If the minister is saying, `This is what flexibility is available,' what he is talking

         about is compelling state governments to remove the standard of education of kids in public schools. If he is saying that, he should be honest: flexibility means cutting back standards. If the minister cuts back standards, there will be a massive increase in the exodus from public schools to private schoolsâ€”and we stand by our comment that the public school system will be very much residual.

         â€”This bill is a very slim volume. All it does is change several numbers in the schedule. It is a slim but fairly important bill since the numbers it changes relate to the quantum
         <break page="5524" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of funds to be provided for vocational education and training for 1996, 1997 and 1998.

        The VET Funding Act, which this bill amends, provides the great bulk of funding for vocational education in this country and we see some significant changes. When set against currently legislated amounts, the bill increases funding for 1996 by $13.4 million and reduces it for 1997 by $58.6 million.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What underpins these changes? The second reading speech, which runs to about half a page in length, certainly does not provide us with much enlightenment on that score. It simply points out that the 1997 amount still exceeds the 1996 amount by $10.6 million, notwithstanding the reduction on amounts already legislated. This typifies the presentational approach of this government as it seeks to minimise the impact of its cuts to education. Whether it be higher education, schools or vocational education, the approach is to focus on year to year variations rather than on the only relevant comparisons if we are to judge the impact of this government's decision; that is, the comparison with what already sits in the forward estimates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What does underlie the funding changes? As I understand it, the change for 1996 simply reflects the impact of price changes and as such is innocuous. However, 1997 is a somewhat different story. The difference between the currently legislated 1997 amount and that proposed in this bill reflects two budget measures in particular: the elimination of the five per cent real growth provided by the previous government and the imposition of a five per cent efficiency dividend on TAFE funding.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        By examining legislation like this we start to get a more realistic sense of this government's ballyhooed commitment to vocational education. According to the portfolio budget statement, these two measures cut vocational education by $91 million and $66 million respectively over the four years of the forward estimates. This, together with other savings measures, such as cuts to ANTA, comfortably exceeds the additional funding being made through the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system. That is before you factor in the massive cuts to labour market
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         programs, which I will have more to say about in a minute.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is interesting to note that TAFE is being expected to absorb an even bigger efficiency dividend than other Commonwealth own purpose outlays and specific purpose payments. The general impost is three per cent in the first year with an additional one per cent applied cumulatively for each succeeding year. TAFE is being expected to cop a five per cent cut from the very first year. In fact, the amount specified in the vocational education and training measures table in the portfolio budget statement is the additional slug to TAFE over and above that on other areas through the general efficiency dividend on Commonwealth own purposes outlays and specific purpose payments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Where is the axe to fall? According to the department, the impact will be split between recurrent and capital activities. I am informed by the department that in the recurrent area the main cuts will likely be in the funds available to ANTA for national projects and interstate cooperative projectsâ€”the former to be almost halved, according to a chart I have been given by the department entitled `Preliminary planned expenditure 1997 VET funds', and the latter to be cut to zero in 1997, from $10 million in 1996.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There will also be cuts in total capital from $227,644,000 to $200 million. Obviously cuts of this sort will have a significant impact. You have to take into account the impact of these sorts of decisions when making overall assessments of what the government is doing in this area.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A variety of things is being funded under national projects. I do not believe that final decisions have yet been made as to which national projects are likely to be affected. I have a list of things which are funded under national projects. There is a whole variety of activities at a national level that relate to research, things like research and evaluation, training market development, national vocational education and training system developmentâ€”and that includes some equity measures and curriculum development. Just exactly
        <break page="5525" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         what the impact of these changes will be remains to be seen.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Likewise, I am advised by the department that interstate cooperative projects are going to be substantially affected by this reduction. This includes a whole range of activities which take place generally in close proximity to state borders. Therefore, it is considered to be appropriate that the projects be implemented through a cooperative arrangement between states, rather than any particular state assuming responsibility.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have a list of interstate cooperative projects. The proposition is that funding for this area will fall to zero and, I understand, be replaced by bilateral arrangements between the states. It seems to me there must be some risk that some worthwhile activities are going to be sacrificed. An example of the sorts of things that are funded under this arrangement is the cross&amp;hyphen;border Gold Coast&amp;hyphen;Tweed Heads project. This is a joint New South Wales&amp;hyphen;Queensland project which provides for the delivery of training in office studies, retail, travel, hospitality, fashion marketing, computing, business, Aboriginal and disability studies in the cross&amp;hyphen;border areas of Queensland and New South Wales. That costs the best part of $1 million.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is also the Wide Area Learning Project which is, again, a joint New South Wales&amp;hyphen;Queensland project. This involves delivery of services to isolated and disadvantaged communities with little or no previous access to further education and training. There is a whole list here. I will not go through all of them, but those are a couple of examples of the sorts of things which are funded under this particular program. It remains to be seen the extent to which those cooperative cross&amp;hyphen;border activities will be picked up by bilateral arrangements between the states.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Obviously, the cuts in capital funding are also quite significant. TAFE capital covers TAFE buildings, child&amp;hyphen;care centres, general equipment, skills centres and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander capital projects. I am not sure where the brunt of the reductions in capital funding is likely to fall but, again, it seems inevitable that some worthwhile activities are going to lose out.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is the impact of this bill. As I said, it is a very slim volumeâ€”just one sheet which changes two or three numbers in a scheduleâ€”but what underlies it and what it reflects is the impact of some of the government's decisions that are designed to cut costs. When you take into account all these cuts and look through the budget measures table as it relates to the vocational education and training program within the DEETYA portfolio, then you do not get the sort of increase in commitment to this area that the government likes to trumpet. The additional MAATS funding is there, but it is exceeded by the cuts that have been made in this sort of area.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At this point I think it might be useful to review where things have gone in the vocational education and training area in recent times. If you were to listen to this government's rhetoric, you would think that everything worth while originated as a result of the current minister's initiatives. Things like reform of the entry level training system, the introduction of vocational education into schoolsâ€”all these activities, in so far as the Commonwealth is involved, you would think were solely the result of the great beneficence and wisdom of the present Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In actual fact, there has been quite a deal of policy development and implementation in this area over the past few years. Clearly, it is predominantly a state responsibility but in recent times, particularly under the former Labor government, the Commonwealth has assumed a greater role in ensuring the coordinated development of our national vocational education and training system. Throughout its life, the Labor government paid considerable attention to this area, but particularly so since about 1990.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Honourable members will recall in the late 1980s the federal government undertook a major review of higher education, leading to the production of a white paper and a green paper. Those decisions resulted in a major boost to funding to higher education and a major expansion in the system. Perhaps one of the valid criticisms that might be levelled against what we did in government was that we did not adopt a sufficiently holistic and
         <break page="5526" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          integrated approach to the development of tertiary education. In retrospect, we should not have necessarily done that higher education exercise in isolation.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no doubt that with the end of the binary system in higher education and the incorporation of more and more types of vocational studies, there is a degree of overlap between what higher education does and what vocational education does. The sort of training and education that is provided in TAFE colleges overlaps to an increasing degree with university courses in areas like police studies, information technology and business studies. There is a great deal of overlap and it is not entirely clear where the boundary between those two sectors should be.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         An interesting survey was conducted recently involving school leavers. It showed a considerable degree of confusion on the part of many school leavers about what the respective roles of the systems are. Students had the opportunity to look at prospectuses of courses in the sorts of areas that I have mentioned, offered by TAFEs on the one hand and universities on the other. They really could not see a clear, logical distinction between them, apart from the notion that university studies are in some sense more prestigious. So, at the time, we should have thought more about these relationships.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In so far as there was a flaw in our policy making processes at that point, it was well and truly addressed from about 1990 onwards, when a number of major reviews in the  vocational education area were undertaken. In the first instance, we had the Finn review of post&amp;hyphen;compulsory education and training for young people. That was a major undertaking, the result of which was that the government and the states committed themselves to achieving certain key targets for participation by young people in post&amp;hyphen;compulsory education and training by the year 2000. The idea was to try to make it almost universal for young people leaving school to receive some worthwhile training or education after the compulsory years. The Finn review was really a major galvanising event that led to a good number of other commitments and decisions by government.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In the One Nation statement back in 1992, the former government agreed to commit itself to a major expansion and enhancement of vocational education. We committed ourselves to provide an additional $70 million in growth funding each year for several years to underpin a new national framework which was to be embodied in the creation of ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority. It was given substantial responsibility for the overall coordination and development of vocational education in Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another related activity was the so-called key competencies exercise, undertaken by a committee chaired by Henry Mayer. A bit further down the track was the work of the Employment and Skills Formation Council, which was part of the NBEET structure chaired by Laurie Carmichael. It considered how you might go about modernising in a comprehensive way the entry level training system. A very important set of proposals came out of that, originally termed the Australian vocational certificate training system but later shortened to the Australian vocational training system.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It envisaged a thoroughly modernised system of entry level training, much broader than the traditional apprenticeships and existing traineeships. There would be an attempt to get into industries which are currently poorly serviced by entry level training arrangements and to redevelop the courses to put them on a competency basis, which is absolutely crucial. The Labor government went about undertaking a number of measures to give effect to these sorts of propositions.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          At the time of the change of government, a range of activities was in hand. There was a broad national framework and agreement on how the Australian vocational training system should be progressed. A major body of work was being undertaken under the auspices of ANTA to redevelop courses and curricula to make them consistent with AVTS principlesâ€”developing a competency basis and developing a more flexible set of arrangements so that courses could be more flexibly delivered in contexts other than the traditional college environment, which obviously goes to the
          <break page="5527" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           delivery of training in workplaces and in schools.

          The next significant development was the Working Nation statement. It gave considerable attention to entry level training, introduced the national training wage, and created Nettforce and the network of industry training companies, which had the involvement of a variety of players in industry and was designed to encourage the expansion and establishment of entry level training arrangements in new areas.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Contrary to what the current minister would have us believe, a significant amount of attention was given to how to get vocational education options into schools. The former government committed $38 million to the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation, which was designed to support initiatives to provide vocational education and work experience for school students. The jobs pathway guarantee was another significant initiative which aimed to smooth the transition from school to work. There was a range of things being done.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Mr Aquilina, the New South Wales education minister, told me recently that some 40,000 students in New South Wales schools are undertaking vocational studies. So it is not as if this whole area had been neglected.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Having said that, I think that what the current minister is doing by strengthening vocational education in schools is good. I support it. When I made the point in the education debate about the $20 million a year being applied to MAATSâ€”modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship systemâ€”in schools, I was not wanting to be churlish. While it is not new money in one senseâ€”in effect, money is being earmarked that already exists in the vocational education programâ€”it is an appropriate priority to develop these school based apprenticeships and traineeships. What is being done in that area is an initiative of which we would be broadly supportive. I simply wish to make the point that it is not as if we, when in government, had disregarded this area. It is an important area, and we were giving it more attention.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It could be said that we should have done it a lot earlier. That applies to all Australian
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           governments. We have never in the past gone down the route of trying to develop the kind of structure that exists in Germany and some northern European countries where a comprehensive suite of vocational options in schools is provided. We are going to have to move more and more in that direction given the much higher retention rates in the last two years of school. We have to develop appropriate options. There is a range of issues about the right way to properly provide and properly integrate vocational options in schools. That said, it is an important direction. It is good that it is being pursued.

          Turning to entry level traineeships, again, the current government seeks to disparage a lot of what was done here, particularly the Working Nation entry level training initiatives. It is interesting that the report of the evaluation of Working Nation that was issued earlier this year, which looked at all the different Working Nation initiatives, was pretty positive on the whole about what was done in the entry level training area. It made the point that things were slow to get started in the 1994-95 year, but it also made the point that that had largely been corrected and the number of traineeships was pretty much on target for 1995-96. Page 73 of that report, talking about the entry level training initiatives associated with Working Nation, states:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Traineeships are expanding into new industries and occupations, for example, as a proportion of all commencements, commencements in manufacturing and finance, property and business services expanded considerably between 1993-94 and 1995-96. Many employers, often those who have never taken on a trainee before, are taking up traineeship packages. They are particularly interested in packages delivered entirely on the job.
         </para>
         <para>
          It goes on to say:

         <para font-size="-=2">
          Employer acceptance is vital for the success of traineeships. Employers who have taken on trainees are quite positive in their attitudes to the system and individual trainees. Some have described the traineeship system as an excellent program that deserves much better publicity and promotion.

          There were some significant achievements as a result of Working Nation in this broad area of entry level training. Once in a while it would be nice if the present minister were to give credit for that.

           The current government and the current minister are pursuing a range of initiatives in this area, most of which we would broadly support, possibly with some reservations in some areas. I understand that there is a good deal of work going on to try to rationalise the whole system of recognition of courses and to get a better relationship between courses that are developed and the competency standards which are developed by the national training bodiesâ€”the ITABS. I think that is important. It is envisaged that the ITABS will have a greater role, not just for developing the standards but also for areas such as curriculum development, recognition and so forth so that total packages can be developed with the ITABS much more in the driver's seat. By and large, I think that is good. We support that sort of direction that the current government is taking.

           Another important aspect is the so-called user choice concept where you try to achieve a greater degree of relevance to the training provided by industry needs. This is something that we were pursuing in government too. In fact, last year in government we had secured broad agreement from the states to the basic concept of user choice, and a number of pilot projects were in the process of being pursued. This has the potential to yield benefits if it has the result that we end up with training being provided by a variety of providers that are properly attuned to industry needs. The one reservation I have about itâ€”and I think it is a significant reservation and it has to be properly addressedâ€”is that we do not end up with industry driving the whole thing to too great an extent.

           The fact is that our vocational, education and training system is about doing more than meeting the needs of particular firms. It is about providing broad generic competencies and capabilities that will serve people well throughout their working lives. We do not want people being provided with training which is very specifically attuned to the needs of particular employers.

            that eventuates and that we do not end up with a situation where, as a result of user choice, public funds provided for vocational education and training end up being just another kind of industry subsidy. It is very important that the purposes of our system are broader than that.

           The last matter that I would like to comment on in the time available is the proposed cuts to labour market programs. This interacts with what I might term the mainstream vocational education and training system in a number of ways. The first point I would make is that we do not accept the rationale that the government has put forward for those cuts. They are very substantial cutsâ€”about $1&amp;half; billion over the forward estimates years. That will have a very severe impact on the prospects of some of the most disadvantaged people in our society.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The point of labour market program interventions is to avoid the creation of a large underclass of people who are more or less permanently alienated from the labour market and alienated from the world of work, where we have a situation where unemployment becomes a generational thing passed on from one generation to the next. We have to avoid that. A very central part of the rationale for labour market program intervention of the scale that we undertook was to avoid precisely that kind of scenario.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The government, in seeking to justify the cuts, has made reference to the evaluation of Working Nation that was done by the department. I have read that evaluation. It does not support the government's conclusion, in my opinion. The government has taken the fact that this report has drawn attention to a range of shortcomings in the way some of these programs were being implemented as a justification for a massive cut. That does not follow. In fact, the evaluation report says that in terms of the impact of these sorts of programs on the long-term unemployed, it is simply too early to make a proper evaluation. It proposed a considerable amount of further research in order to get a better sense of what the long-term impacts are. Even if you are looking for cuts, it seems entirely premature to be carving up Working Nation on the basis
           <break page="5529" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

           We never disputed the need to finetune and change substantially in some cases the way these programs are implemented and structured. This is an area where, as a nation, we do not have a great deal of experience. Labour market program intervention on this sort of scale is quite new and undoubtedly there were mistakes made in the way many of these things were being implemented. That does not warrant throwing the baby out with the bathwater. We continue to maintain that programs of this sort have a very important role to play.

Cuts in TAFE staff, and consequential reductions in TAFE infrastructure flowing from the non&amp;hyphen;availability of substantial amounts of labour market program funding, are going to be quite significant.

         â€”One of the saddest things about Labor's 13 years in office was how they neglected young Australians. Over the past six years, the number of apprenticeships has fallen from approximately 62,000 to 50,000, the lowest in 30 years. It is little wonder that youth unemployment hit over 50 per cent in some areas. My interest in education stems from my background as a teacher. In my maiden speech to the House I emphasised the importance I place on education, particularly vocational education. The previous Labor government seemed content to keep young people at school until year 12 without any real consideration for their needs or desires. I believe young people should be able to consider their future path at year 10 and be able to apply to do an apprenticeship or a TAFE course, or enter the work force or continue to year 12. Whatever these young people decide, we as a government should make it as easy as possible for them.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Young people who choose to enter the work force will quickly learn the work ethic that a full day's work is required if one is to earn a full day's pay. They would learn that some aspects of their job must be done whether they like it or not. They would also learn there is a great feeling of self&amp;hyphen;achievement after completing a day's work. Young people
        <break page="5530" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         who choose to enter an apprenticeship would learn these ethics on top of their trade skills. By the time they reached 18, they would have begun to understand about the working world. Unfortunately, the current system has put off too many employers who see it as rigid and complex. As a consequence, many young people are left unemployed with no prospect of obtaining work. We need to redevelop the training ethos in Australia and in Australian employing industries.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As the government, we will promote the value of investment in further education and training. We will be providing assistance for those who wish to access education and training opportunities. The previous government's indenture system for apprentices was far too complex. Apprentices spent large blocks of time at college. Many of the employers in my electorate complained of this because, when tendering, particularly on construction type jobs, they were unable to plan and price their jobs because they were not sure whether they would have their apprentices available. The system was unattractive to small and medium business because of the burden of paperwork and the impost placed on employers to organise the TAFE courses for their apprentices, and also the inability for apprentices to move easily between states, particularly in the border areas.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But now, under the coalition, there is some good news about apprenticeships. A key objective of the government is to provide real jobs for young people. The modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship systemâ€”MAATSâ€”will provide individuals with the opportunity to obtain world&amp;hyphen;class skills and enterprises with training that meets their needs and contributes to their future income.

        As a result of the government's new income support scheme, the wages of apprentices and trainees will be guaranteed at a higher level than unemployment benefits.

        Young Australians deserve a fighting chance and this government is delivering on its election promises. The only way to create real jobs is to involve small and medium business.

Under the scheme, job brokers will be able to tender for government funds to secure suitable employment for school leavers. Public and private training providers, community organisations, and public and private employment agencies are some of the groups that will be eligible to tender for funds.

        Another beneficial training initiative in the electorate of Lilley is the development of an integrated race training centre. Lilley is known as the racing capital of Queensland. Within the electorate fall most of south&amp;hyphen;east Queensland's major race tracks. Almost 1,000 thoroughbred horses, a big percentage from Queensland owned and operated stud farms, are trained within the electorate, with the suburbs of Hendra, Hamilton and Ascot also providing a traditional base for the stabling of horses in south&amp;hyphen;east Queensland. The racing industry is strategically important to Queensland. It is the state's fourth largest industry and contributed $404 million to the state's GDP in 1990-91 and it directly employs 23,000 people.

The export potential of the project has already been demonstrated with the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre already marketing the courses in Asia.

        The courses run by the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre utilise the expertise of leading personnel associated with the breeding and the racing industry. Foreign students are able to study English at the same time as they undertake their vocational course. The intake of 57 Japanese students in January 1996 has been very successful.

        Best of all, these foreign students are excellent advocates for promoting our racing industry. It is estimated that within the next five to 10 years at least 10 new racetracks will be opened in China alone. This will require the purchase of more than 10,000 horses and expanded infrastructure in a country with no racing expertise. We, therefore, have the opportunity to educate people who will eventually become influential in the South&amp;hyphen;East Asian, Chinese and Japanese racing industries.

         Finally, the development of an integrated racing training centre in south-east Queensland with the support of the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre will be an excellent platform for the Australian racing industry to seek out further markets in South-East Asia. A competitive training system is vital to Australia's future prosperity. The government's apprenticeship plan will create real, lasting jobs for young Australians instead of trying to hide the problem of youth unemployment. This plan will provide the solution.

         Too often under Labor young Australians completed one training course after another with no chance of getting a job at the end of them.

The government's focus on apprenticeships will help create jobs by delivering new types of apprenticeship and other quality training qualifications for existing and emerging industries; updated and modernised apprenticeships in traditional areas; school based apprenticeships for young people, especially for those not going on to university or full-time TAFE; more multiple workplace apprenticeships and traineeships through group training companies; off&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;job training chosen by the enterprise and the trainee; and expanded training opportunities for regional Australia. I have no hesitation in commending this bill to the House.

        This bill really breaches all the government's rhetoric in the lead-up to 2 March about wanting to do something positive to tackle youth unemployment in Australia. The situation has become even worse since 2 March. I refer in passing to the employment figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics just a week ago for the month of September. Not only did we lose 31,400 full-time jobs in a monthâ€”not an inconsiderable number of jobsâ€”but youth unemployment has now blown out to 28.1 per cent. That is the national figure. It is worse in some regions and some suburbs of metropolitan Australia.

        I suggest that, if the member for Lilley is concerned about the needs and aspirations of young people, she ought to consider the fine print of the bill and consider the fact that the current budget strategy of the government is a no-jobs budget. It offers no hope to young people with respect to job opportunities and it really reduces their opportunities to pursue realistic training aimed at ensuring that they can open the door to meaningful long-term job opportunities.

        So to use the minister's wordsâ€”and they were words used recently by the minister, Senator Vanstoneâ€”it is a cruel hoax. I suggest that her bill is a very cruel hoax. I know she likes to fantasise at the moment about some of these cruel hoaxes. She has, if anything, been caught with her pants down in the Senate estimates process in recent days with respect to some of those examples she likes to lay out for public consideration, but this is a factual situation.

         This bill really is a cruel hoax. It misleads the Australian public. The bill fails to implement the undertakings given by the government to the Australian public prior to the election and it effectively, unfortunately, also impedes cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states. I think that is very important. I believe that cooperation, be it at a workplace level in the community or in our own home, between governments is important if you want to make progress. I think there is nothing more important at the moment than making further progress in the reform and streamlining of vocational education and training in Australia.

         Whether the ministers responsible for vocational education and training like it or not, the real losers today are the young people. They will be the real losers if this bill is passed by the parliament. Ministers Kemp and Vanstone really have been trying recently to convey the impression, and it is a false impression, that all the states unanimously and completely agree with their so-called reform agendaâ€”the modern Australian aprenticeship and traineeship system, MAATSâ€”and its associated reforms. I know they are casting around looking for a new name at the moment. For some strange reason, all of a sudden MAATS is no longer acceptable as a name to the ministers responsible for this bill.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I will tell you why. The truth of the matter is that not only is there no agreement with the states but the government has to search for a new name because it realises that the electorate is starting to see through its MAATS con. It ought to examine its performance with respect to these matters as a matter of urgency.

         I want to raise in passing today the real problem confronting Australia at the moment with respect to unemployment. It is a national problem, but it is fast becoming a major regional problem. Let's just take a couple of regions in which youth unemployment is an issue of concern. It is an issue of concern to the local council and the state members but, unfortunately, in some instances it is not an issue of concern to the federal members who represent those regions in this parliament.

          I will go firstly to the region of Richmond, Tweed Heads and the mid&amp;hyphen;north coastâ€”the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales. We have a couple of new members, but I cannot hear, for example, the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) standing up and thumping the table about the question of unemployment. But when he goes back to his seat tomorrow night, he ought to think seriously about the question of unemployment, because the unemployment queue in that region has jumped dramatically. In one month it has risen from 15.1 per cent to 16.7 per cent. That means that in one monthâ€”and the region takes in Richmond, Tweed Heads and the mid&amp;hyphen;north coastâ€”unemployment has grown. That means that 2,800 people in that region have been thrown onto the unemployment queues.

          That means that, unfortunately for those membersâ€”and they are new members: people like Mr Causley, an experienced politician, and the new member for Richmond, Mr Larry Anthonyâ€”they have to start explaining to their region when they return this weekend why it is that no region other than their region has had such a sharp increase in unemployment. I might say in passing that that region was one of the real beneficiaries of the Labor Party's reform agenda when it was in government, not only in respect of vocational education and training but also in respect of implementation of Working Nation.

The new member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) has a lot to say from time to time, but he has not got much to say at the moment about the question of unemployment. I can understand why. Let's have a look at the unemployment figures, which were released just recently, with respect to Townsville and Mount Isa. They take in towns such as Townsville, Charters Towers, Mount Isa and Normanton. What do you find? They are one-sixth of the way through a full term of government. It is not as though they have not had time, because their budget strategy is going to fix it all. Their workplace relations bill is going to fix it all.

          The fact is that the member does not seem to be concerned about the issue of jobs and creating opportunities for young people. He ought to start being concerned about it, because unemployment numbers have jumped every month since July. Local unemployment was then seven per cent. It increased in August to 7.2 per cent. But it gets worse. What is the September figure? It has jumped dramatically to 8.3 per cent. So in July there were 7,600 people unemployed in that region. There has been an increase in two months to 9,600 people.

          Then we have the new parliamentary secretary, Mr Ronaldson. Let's just go to his region, because he does not think unemployment is a real issue at the moment. Let's just have a look at what is happening in regional Victoriaâ€”another area which really benefited from the Labor reform agenda. The Labor government cared about regional Australia. The Labor government was prepared to intervene and do something to try to reduce unemployment and give people a second opportunity in life. It did not matter what age bracket you were in, whether you were young, mature aged, unemployed or whatever.

          So let's go to the central highlands and the Wimmera region. I hope the new parliamentary secretary, Mr Ronaldson, is listening because he is going to have to explain to his region why it is thatâ€”in an area that includes towns such as Ballarat, Ararat and Horshamâ€”they have lost some quite significant employers in the last couple of weeks in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. For example, they lost Holeproof at Horsham, and last week Jockey Australia announced that they are going to close down in Maryborough by the end of the year. Another 59 jobs will disappear. He is going to have to explain why, despite all the promises of the new government that it is all going to be fixed, unemployment is still rising. They have everything right: they have a reform agenda, they have a budget strategy and they have changes to industrial relations.

           Unfortunately for them the con has been exposed. That is why the states themselves are resisting the changes, as are the state training authorities. The passage of the bill will only make matters worse. Let us go to the large state of New South Wales. It has publicly stated, contrary to what the minister would have the Australian public believe, that it is opposed to MAATS. It has signalled its objections not only in ministerial meetings but also in the public arena so as to ensure that the Australian public understands that it is a con. It ought to be exposed for what it is: a con.

           The New South Wales Minister for Education and Training, Mr Aquilina, recently stated after a meeting of state training ministers that MAATS will disadvantage trainees and apprentices. He also said fairly and squarely that it will no longer deliver benefits for employers. I listened to the member for Lilley. She quoted some wage rates. Mr Aquilina produced the goods. He produced them out there in the public. He put them on the table for the people of New South Wales to have a look at and to examine the fine print. But we know they cannot read the fine print. Ask Senator Short. It even looks as if some of the people who sit in the House of Representatives, such as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), have difficulty reading the fine print at the moment. I wonder if the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) can read the fine print. They said that it means lower wages for apprentices and lower quality training. It is there in the fine print: lower wages for apprentices and lower quality training.

MAATS will water down the accreditation procedures for training. It will mean that some employersâ€”listen to thisâ€”can utilise young workers as cheap labour.

         â€”When I heard some of the remarks of the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin), I thought that some humility had entered into this debate on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill from the Australian Labor Party. The honourable member made the quite significant concession that the previous government had failed to take an integrated approach to training. In addition, we heard the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who has just finished speaking, concedeâ€”and it was a concession, as I will illuminate in a secondâ€”that the level of unemployment amongst youth now is 28 per cent. Throughout the election campaign, the Labor Party said it was seven per cent. Paul Keating said, `It's not 27 per cent at all; it's seven per cent.' He went all over the countryside saying that it was seven per cent. So at last we have heard the truth from the Australian Labor Party that it actually is 28 per cent and not seven per cent. That figure has gone now.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is interesting to bear in mind some of the remarks the honourable gentleman made. He developed irrationalism to dizzy heights. He said to the Houseâ€”certainly not tongue in cheekâ€”that the government had all these

       <para first-indent="16">
        Interestingly enough, when I went around the electorate on this issue during the election campaign and as I do now, the two biggest issues in relation to the employment of young people were the cost of labour and the unfair dismissal legislation. Wherever I went, the same story came from business people everywhereâ€”the cost of labour, the unfair dismissal laws and the lack of flexibility. If you put all that together, you can say, `Is that something we did? Is that something we should have fixed?'

       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us have a look at some even greater statistics, more illuminative of the farcical nature of some of the opposition comments on this matter. In March 1996, 242,800 teenagers were seeking full-time employment. That was almost the same as in March 1995. Notwithstanding all the schemes the Labor Party had running to try to ensure their re-election, they still did not make an imprint in real terms in the unemployment situation over that period.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Even worse is the statistic in relation to apprenticeships. The number of apprenticeships and traineeships that commenced in 1994-95 was the same as in 1984-85â€”10 years ago. So in 10 years they did absolutely nothing to improve the level of apprenticeships and traineeships in this country. That is really what we are here about. Now the member for Batman is getting into us, having been here five minutes, to try to change this mess that we have been bequeathed. He is saying, `You should've done something.

        Industrial relations arrangements have hindered schools and local industries in creating pathways to real jobs. There are rigid restrictions on the mix of training and work students can undertake, and the consequences of those restrictions on combinations of work and training are that employers have been discouraged from providing more than one day of training a week, students have not been able to undertake apprenticeships while enrolled at school and those seeking part&amp;hyphen;time training and work under an apprenticeship, such as women returning to the work force, have been unable to do so. So those are the restrictions that we have been bequeathed and that we are, through the policies of this government, seeking to redress, subject to the bloody&amp;hyphen;minded attitude of the opposition and the Democrats in the Senate.

        The bill before the House sets funding levels for vocational education and training for 1998. It will be remembered that the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 gave effect to an agreement, announced by the then Prime Minister on 21 July 1992, between the Commonwealth, states and territories for the establishment of ANTA. The objectives of the agreement include the establishment of national vocational education and training systems, closer interaction between industry and vocational education and training providers, an effective training market and improved cross&amp;hyphen;sectoral links.

        Given the concession of the member for Sydney, it appears that in those objectives there has been an inflexibility, if you like, in relation to training. It is that inflexibility that has not assisted with the efficacy of the ANTA system. Under the procedures that are

         being put in place by this government, and under the policy of the modern Australian apprenticeship and training system, MAATS, it is ensured that there will be the sort of flexibility that has been outlined by the minister and also that has been encouraging particularly schools and also other educational institutions in various electoratesâ€”in my own electorate of Dickson I refer to the Pine Rivers High Schoolâ€”to develop a training system that is going to help people on the ground.

        It is no good having training unless you have something for them to go to. Sure, we need people to be better trained, but there also needs to be a job placement for those people and a work opportunity. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said last October when he spoke to ACOSS, we need a more competitive and a more efficient economy if we are to have a more compassionate society. So it gets back to the total approach of getting the economy going and having training that is directed to training people into the sort of work that is in demand.

        In my own electorate, for example, that lacuna, if you like, in the link between trained people and available work is felt more often than not, it seems, in the panel beating and automotive industries where it is extremely difficult to get people who are qualified in those areas of panel beating and motor mechanics whereas there is a surfeit of trained people in some of the other areasâ€”and that is reflected particularly in the construction area at the present time. But that has been the trend, unfortunately, in the past 10 years or so. The trend has been to train people in the construction type areas and, unfortunately, the jobs have not been there. On the other hand, people in the technological side of training have been hard to find.

        It is important, in looking at the question of training overall, to look first of all to the past. In my view, there has been demonstrated a dilution in the value of apprentices and trainees. It seems that over time we have developed a culture in society where the value of those apprentices and trainees has somehow been undermined. You get the culture of people saying, `I am only an apprentice, I am
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         only a trainee,' as opposed to someone doing a graduate course that would entitle them to a degree and letters after their name. That, I think, has been an unfortunate development in the overall economy, because that has caused people perhaps to move into the more esoteric areas and the less productive areas of our economic and social make&amp;hyphen;up. I am not trying to downgrade the social side of degrees and so forth, but we do need trained and skilled people.

        The fact that we are finding such a shortage of those good and highly skilled trainees and people who have come through the apprenticeship system is reflected in some examples I have struck in my own electorate. For example, in a cabinet making shop in my electorate the proprietor has had an enormous difficulty in obtaining a skilled cabinet maker. For some time he had been advertising, but the level of skill was just not what he was requiring and the person had to be let go. This went on for a period of months. Finally, a person from the United Kingdom walked into his shop and he turned out to be the best tradesman that this particular constituent had ever had. However, he was only visiting the country and, unfortunately, had to leave at the end of 12 months. The proprietor has since contacted me and sought my help with a view to getting this fellow permanent residency in this country. He showed me some of the work of this trained person and then compared it with some of the work that he had been getting from some of the other people whom he had employed and there was, it would seem, a marked difference between the work.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That made me think. What has happened to training in this country? Have we devalued training? Have we lost the ability to ensure the standards that we need in these sorts of skills? When I was doing my apprenticeship it seemed to me that the people who had been trained in Europe had a greater level of skill and a greater level of ability to impart those skills than some of the local tradesmen. I hate to say it, but that seemed to be the case.

        I wondered about that then, and I wonder about the fact that that seems to have continued to some degree. We must look at the levels of expertise that we have brought to

         this country through the migrant programâ€”and I welcome that. We must not be afraid to draw on that experience, but we also must use that experience to help us improve our own standards. We can learn a lot from the standards that have been set. Perhaps we should look harder at the training methods that we employ and compare them with the training methods of people from overseas in order to develop the expertise that we need to improve our standing here.

        I do not think that there is anybody on either side of this House who understates the importance of vocational education and training to Australia. It is fair to say that vocational educational training has always been a second cousin to university education.

        We still have a long way to go to make inroads on that perception, but it is very important that we do and that young people understand that there are many pathways to employment.

        The Australian economy has in recent years changed dramatically in its structure. The traditional sectors of agriculture and manufacturing have declined and we have seen a massive growth in the services sector: in tourism, education, banking, transport and information technology.

        I go back to my own upbringing in agriculture. We have seen massive changes to the structure of agriculture. Once upon a time in dairy farming, when you ran a herd of cows and produced milk from the farm, it would have to be done with the assistance of some six to eight people involved in the harvesting of hay and in the production of milk itself. But now the structure has changed to the point where one person, possibly two, can milk a herd of 300 cows and essentially do the hay harvesting by themselves. It has become a very capital intensive activity and the demand for labour has been significantly reduced. Of course, the demand for new management skills, an ability to handle information technology and the ability to apply new production techniques have all created a new set of demands on the agricultural work force. But we have seen a massive contraction of that work force.

        It is in this context that Labor in government moved to massively expand the vocational education sector in this country. In 1992 we saw the creation of the Australian National Training Authority, and that occurred after lengthy negotiations with the states. A major task given to ANTA was the creation of a genuinely national system of vocational education in this country, and we have walked a long way along the path to achieving that objective. To do that, we had to increase the expenditures to the sector, and it is those expenditures that the government is reducing here today.

        The objectives that were enshrined in the legislation which set up ANTA really are most critical when you look at the needs of the Australian economy and the need for that economy to remain competitive in a global sense. There were four main objectives. One was the establishment of a national vocational education and training system. As I mentioned, we moved quite a way down the path to achieving that in our time in office. Another significant objective of that particular legislation was a closer interaction between industry and vocational education and training providers.

I will share with those members from the other side, a little later on, some very interesting statistics comparing the Victorian and the New South Wales TAFE systems.

         It is not a matter of increasing funding in order to achieve effectiveness, it is a matter of how you restructure the TAFE system, the vocational education system, to respond to those needs. Money does not solve the problems of our society but, of course, the previous Labor government failed to understand that and we are now burdened with over a $10 billion bankcard debt. Their answer was to throw more money at it. Who pays for it? The taxpayer pays for it. What are the results? Nil.

         Vocational education and training funding by the government has two main objectivesâ€”to ensure young people are trained and to ensure that the training is recognised by employers. This fits neatly into what employers are saying about the prospects of employing young people. As I have moved around the electorate and around the country, I have come across three main concerns. The first one is the risk associated with employing young people. I notice that earlier on we had some school groups here and I know that they will be taking a great interest in future employment prospects under this government.

          Employers have doubts because of the risks of employment. These doubts will be allayed by the workplace relations bill and by abol ishing Labor's unfair dismissal provisions.

         The second concern that employers have expressed is about the cost of employment itself. Through the MAATS program and the workplace relations bill, we are offering incentives to employers to put people on. The incentives offered to small and medium sized businesses through MAATS include a commencement payment of $1,250 when taking on an apprentice or trainee, and a bonus payment of $250 per apprentice or trainee taken on and above the last year's intake. Employers will also be entitled to an additional progress payment. This is an incentive for the employers.

         The third concern that employers have about putting young people on is the inability of our education system to prepare young people for the transition to work. At the moment, young people have two choices: they either go onto the dole queue and become unskilled or they go to university. A whole group of young people out there do not have any other choice. The honourable member for Corio said that choices are important and that we need to have pathways which will lead to more than two choices. I welcome his endorsement of that particular strategy.

         In recent years the pathways have disappeared. Many have asked why. There are two main reasons why the pathway for our young people moving out of school into employment has gone. Firstly, secondary schools across the nation are unable to prepare our young people for their working lives. For many years, until the late 1980s, Victorian teenagers wanting to pursue a trades based career attended their local technical school. From there they went into an apprenticeship. Many have lamented the passing of the technical school system. I certainly am one of those. I know there are a lot of parents in my electorate who also lament the passing of the technical school system.

         Under Labor, vocational education and training suffered. Working Nation did not deliver what it promised. The apprenticeship system was virtually abandoned under the previous government. In recent years, the number of apprenticeship commencements has been the lowest for 30 years. It was a disgraceful performance by the former government. Labor Party representatives talk about apprenticeships and the lack of opportunities, and yet they are partly to blame. The lack of growth in commencements is directly attributable to the former government's fiscal mismanagement, the general failure of its economic policies and, in particular, its neglect of the apprenticeship system.

In addition to the strengthening of the traditional trade areas, new&amp;hyphen;style apprenticeships, new&amp;hyphen;style traineeships, will be offered to newer industries making up the service sectorâ€”for example, information technology and multimedia.

          That brings me to discuss the effects of funding. The Labor Party, as I mentioned earlier, believes in throwing money at the problem. Let me give a comparison between the TAFE systems in New South Wales and Victoria which shows how well Victoria performs with less money. These statistics from ANTA on benchmarking the performance of the vocational education and training sector in 1995 were put out in July 1996. On three of the four indicators, Victoria comes out not only superior to New South Wales but above the national average.

          In 1995 Victoria received $177 million from the Commonwealth; New South Wales $213 million. What do they get for this? According to the employers, who are critical to this, their view on the availability and accessibility of training shows that Victoria far outstrips New South Wales in terms of satisfaction, 59 per cent compared to 44 per cent. In terms of incorporating on&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;job training, which is what employers are after, New South Wales is slightly better than Victoria. In terms of the flexibility of course content, it is 59 per cent Victoria versus 47 per cent for New South Wales.

Apprenticeships have for many years provided valuable opportunities for young people and the business employing them. The system has worked well for generations of Australians. It is important that it continues to function in years to come. I suggest a number of members and former members of parliament would have started their working lives as apprentices. In fact, in this House, we have the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) who joined this House as members who have served apprenticeships. I am sure that they are proud of their achievements and I would love to see more kids out there able to receive apprenticeships, work their way through the system and achieve the goals which they are after in life.

This government's attack on the TAFE system has been breathtaking in its scope. When I look at the terrible effects in my own state of New South Wales, it brings home in graphic terms just how vicious has been the government's attack on people who dared to keep the ALP in power for 13 years and also on those presently unemployed and those school leavers who may have difficulty finding employment in the future. In the state of New South Wales alone, the TAFE cuts will mean that 4,000 student places will be lost in many regions of the state, including rural areas that are supposed to be looked after by members of the National Party, who quite clearly are not doing their job.

         â€”On 9 October 1996, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) asked me a question relating to the Speaker's Chair in the provisional Parliament House. The chair was a gift in 1926 from the United Kingdom branch of the then Empire Parliamentary Association to the parliament for the representative chamber in the provisional Parliament House. Last week the 70th anniversary of that presentation was celebrated in the chamber during a visit by a delegation from the United Kingdom branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The decision to leave the Speaker's Chair in the House of Representatives chamber of the provisional Parliament House and to design and fabricate a new chairâ€”this chairâ€”for this chamber was made by the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House. The committee recognised the significance of preserving the integrity of the chamber in the provisional building and felt that to remove the chair from that location would completely destroy the character of that chamber and diminish its value as an historical testament to Australia's parliamentary development from 1927 to 1988.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Having taken part in the 70th anniversary celebrations ceremony in that chamber last Friday, I have to say that I am much more fully appreciative of the reasons behind the joint standing committee's decision not to relocate the chair. It is the centrepiece of that historic chamber. It sits very comfortably there, and in many respects it would seem a shame to unsettle the ghosts of the past. There is no doubt that without the chair the chamber would lack a focal point and would be incomplete, empty and devoid of much of its history. However, there is also the view not only that the chair symbolises our parliamentary heritage and traditions but also that its use by generations of Speakers provides a living link between the past and the future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In my response to the honourable member, I said that I was happy to raise the matter with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). I am advised that the Prime Minister has indicated that the possible relocation of the chair is a matter
        <break page="5551" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         which could be reviewed by an all-party committee appointed for this specific purpose. I have no objection to this course of action. As far as I am concerned, the future of the chair is ultimately and properly a matter of decision by the members of this House. I am therefore prepared to be guided by the wishes of the majority of members in this regard.

There is another group that has that view. It happens to be the CFMEU.

Mr Speaker, you would be aware that this was the government that broke the cycle of defeat, neglect, deficit and debt that had been established by Labor in its failure throughout the early 1990s.

This is a man who was thrown out as a has&amp;hyphen;been and a failure on 2 March, and, because he is a lousy sport, he is trying through the help of a preference deal to come back through the back door.

         Let me make it very clear that the statement contained in that letter is completely and utterly misleading. In my letter of 13 September to the premiers and chief ministers, I made it perfectly clear that existing public tenants would not be financially disadvantaged by the reforms. This commitment was reiterated by state and territory housing ministers on 20 September. It was spelt out in detail in the Commonwealth's housing issues paper, which was distributed to the states and territories last week.

         What has happened is that Craig Knowles of the New South Wales Labor government has given Ross Free the housing commission list, and he is writing letters scaring the daylights out of decent, hardworking, low income Australians. That is basically what he is doing. That is precisely what he is doing. Everyone knows that. It is obvious from the looks on the faces of those opposite that that is precisely what is happening.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The hypocrisy of this is that, at the same time as Craig Knowles is handing out this list, his boss, Bob Carr, is endorsing the thrust of Commonwealth policy. Not only are they deceiving and misleading the people of Lindsay, not only are they taking the battlers for granted again, and not only are they behaving contemptuously to hardworking, decent people in the electorate of Lindsay, but also they are lying through their teeth in the process.

         â€”This happens to be a very serious issue which you failed to address in government. The government recently completed the first national English literacy survey for 16 years and that survey contained a subsample of 800 indigenous students. The purpose of this survey is to benchmark, for the first time, literacy amongst indigenous students and to provide a baseline against which the effectiveness of future policies can be measured. I am pleased to say that it is a survey which has had very wide support amongst indigenous communities.

        The particular purpose of my visit to the Northern Territory was to make sure that the government response to the results of this survey, when they come out, will meet the aspirations and hopes of indigenous parents for their children. I was fortunate on this visit to meet with a number of groups of indigenous parents and, without exception, they told me that they wanted their children to be literate in English. I visited the Yipirinya Community School, Yirara College, Gillen Primary School, which was in fact one of the schools that participated in the survey, and the remote community of Yuendumu, which was the community that the member for Oxley did not visit.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this community, I had the opportunity to discuss with the dedicated teachers and the students' parents their hopes for their children. I asked them how they saw the relevance of the government's national literacy goal that every Australian child should be literate by the end of primary school, that they should be able to read, write, spell and communicate. They told me that that was indeed the hope that they had for their own children.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They want their children of course to be proud of their cultural heritage. When English is not the first language of the children, as it is not in many casesâ€”many of these children speak Aranda or Warlpiri or Pitjantjatjara as their first languageâ€”they want their children to have the opportunity to become literate in their vernacular language as well as in English. They made the point, which I thought was a very sound and reasonable point, that literacy in their vernacular language would indeed be supportive of their literacy in English.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It became apparent to me in the course of this visit that for many students the key to literacy is having skilled teachers in English as a second language available in the classroom. The parents and teachers whom I met also made the point that it was important to have an Aboriginal person in the classroom, either as the teacher or as the teacher's aide, someone with whom the Aboriginal students could identify. Everyone I spoke to also emphasised the important need to lift attendance rates at schools, because of course these skills will not be acquired if the students are not attending school. The government is determined to put in place policies which will meet the aspirations of Aboriginal parents and their children. The recent budget contained a very substantial lift in funding for Aboriginal education programs and, indeed, lifted expenditure in this area.

         The government increased spending on Aboriginal education programs by $35 million to $300 million in the budget.

        This funding translates directly into higher standards of facilities and more places in nursing homes and hostels. In the latest round of funding, nine grants worth more than $700,000 will create more than 120 residential care places, and 61 of these are specifically for veterans.

         Professor Doherty's Nobel Prize has quite rightly been hailed as the greatest day in Australian science for 33 years. Only three other Australians have won the prize for medicine: John Eccles, Macfarlane Burnet and Howard Florey. It is an enormous incentive to other scientists and young scientists. Professor Doherty is a true champion in every sense of the word. Just as we recognise our Olympic and other athletic heroes, this government is determined to ensure that Professor Doherty's achievements are recognised.

        You, Prime Minister, know that superannuation funds in their regular annual reports will scarcely refer to any of the hundreds of companies they are likely to be involved in because they do not think it relevant to do so. They do not regard themselves as being in a position to necessarily control interest in them. They are in them primarily as investors.

        This firm in its annual report refers to the `totality of companies' in which it investsâ€”the whole lot. Each one of those interests is a controlling interest. And what is the evidence that they are a controlling interest? It is because each one of them has directors in common. If you go to the Companies Act to look up what constitutes a controlling interest, one of the things they put down is chairmen and directors in common. That establishes it. It is one of the criteria of going to whether or not a controlling interest is established.

        What we have here is a set of companiesâ€”a set of companies related to this one company, Bligh Ventures, in which they establish, via their directorships, controlling interests in what in these circumstances are quite substantial holdings.

        The point here of those guidelines is when there is a potential conflict of interest. And the point too about those guidelines is not to trap people who are in relationships to companies a million miles from their particular investments. The mere existence of a set of shareholdings that might conflict with what a minister does is not of itself a sufficient ground for that minister to dispense with his sharesâ€”it never has been.

        There would be two grounds on which a minister should act and make himself vulnerable if he fails to. The first ground on which he should act is if a particular decision came across his desk which was not a normal decision but a decision which directly impacted on one of those companies and he failed at that point of time with an investment in that company to pass the decision relating to it to another minister or to a public servant or someone else. Alternatively, if a particular operation was so deeply embedded in the totality of his particular portfolio, at that point of timeâ€”seeing it so deeply embedded in the totality of his portfolio and every single

        Your minister decided to do that. This is the central point when you come to this. The person who makes most of my argument is not me; it is not our spokesman, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). The man who argues my case is the minister for industry. The minister for industry, looking at the nature of his portfolio, understanding the structure of his creation, understanding how it relates to his portfolio, said, `All and sundry, I resign my shareholding in this operation; I will dispense with this shareholding.'

        There is a defence being mounted of him, I notice, by one of the commentatorsâ€”who I think is a stockbroking friend of the gentlemanâ€”along the lines of, `How could you blame John Moore for all of this, because the decisions being taken by John Moore or this government are wrecking the value of Bligh?' He came down for the old G&amp;T in the tennis club and said, `Jolly bad form. You can't really oblige the old chap to dispense this, because the decisions that this government has been taking have been devaluing the value of Bligh.' I would say to that stockbroker, `Precisely.'

        That amplifies this simple pointâ€”this simple point that you cannot answer. Active decisions being taken by your portfolio are calling into question the value of the shares in the entity that you operate. The fact that the government as a wholeâ€”as opposed necessarily to yourself, as we do not know what your particular role wasâ€”was taking active decisions which affected the value of those shares, as that stockbroker pointed out, is precisely the point of conflict of interest that you know of, why you declared yourself on this as potentially having a conflict of interest so many weeks ago and for which, as you are Prime Minister now, a whole new set of criteria has been invented to set to one side.

No, I do not believe that is why you did that, and I am not going to claim that level of venality from you. But the point is: you were in there batting and the consequences of your advocacy and the consequences of the decisions being taken by you and your government were, front and centre, impacting on the value of the shares in that little cell of companies, sharing directorships, sharing chairmanships, that you have been party too.

        Thus far, as far as one can see, looking back through the nature of the shareholdings of the relevant minister and when he acquired them, he is still about 30c or 40c away from the value of the share to realise his initial investment. From him and from what we know of him and his wealth, the notion that he should wait around for a share price that exactly suits him is an absurdity. Go out and tell the battlers of Lindsayâ€”since you have decided that you will raise the battlers of Lindsay hereâ€”that you are prepared to sacrifice your guidelines for a hundred grand for one of your ministers or for the protection of as much of that hundred grand as he can possibly protect.

And then pathetically you get up here without having properly read the document that you had there to defend yourself and hung him. You hung him, Prime Minister, and he is hanging you.

         I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to the House that there are three or four fundamental questions that have to be asked and answered to determine whether the high moral ground sought to be taken by the Leader of the Opposition in this debate is sustainable.

         The first proposition that I put to the House and the first question that has got to be asked in this debate is: `Has any member of the government personally gained as a result of their behaviour in the matters that have been under debate?' That is the first question. They may now demur, but I have it time without number on record from the Leader of the Opposition that he himself does not assert they have personally gained. So don't now come into this House and say that they have personally gained. The first thing that we have established in this debate is that Jim Short, John Moore and Brian Gibson have done nothing dishonest and they have not personally gained. That is point No. 1.

        We know the reason he will not move against the member for Ryan. The member for Ryan was involved in a little leadership plot a couple of parliaments ago. The Prime Minister could dispense with Jim Short and Senator Gibson because they do not pose a threat to him in factional terms within the leadership, but the member for Ryan does. Did we notice yesterday that the only time the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) rose to support a minister in a censure debate he did not support the Treasurer (Mr Costello), he didn't support the Prime Minister; he supported the member for Ryan, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourismâ€”probably some tidy little deal about some other numbers there, some shared interest, I suspect.

        Let me just remind the Prime Minister, because it is against him that this censure is moved, of what he was really trying to set up as tests in terms of the interviews over the last couple of days. He has repeated an important thing: the guidelines as they stand are still in place. The current guidelines still apply. What do they say? They say quite clearly that ministers should act to `avoid giving any appearance of using public office for private purposes'.

        He repeated that in his interview today on the Pru Goward program. He said that it was the appearance of conflict of interest that both Jim Short and Brian Gibson left. It was not that they had done anything wrong, but there was the appearance of conflict of interest. That is what we are asserting against the minister for industry.

        The Prime Minister has put on an extra qualificationâ€”a number of extra ones, and I will come to each of them in turn. He says that the ministers were not directly enriching themselves by any of these decisions. We already know that Senator Short stood to get $9,000 off the sale of the bank shares. Isn't that enriching oneself? Is it just that $9,000 does not mean anything? Don't the people of Lindsay think that $9,000 would be a tidy

         â€”Mr Speaker, I have a question that I want to ask of you and it relates to the way in which a matter ought to be handled. Previously, when I was a member of the Senate, I was threatened by the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the House with being garrotted. Today I have been threatened by Mr Brereton, the member for Kingsford-Smith. I find that sort of behaviour offensive. He also threatened a colleague of mine in this place, and I wonder if you could advise me whether or not that behaviour is acceptable in this place. I suggested on the last occasion that the then Senator Gareth Evans required psychiatric treatment. Perhaps I could say the same to Mr Brereton.

        Coming from an electorate in Queenslandâ€”around three times the size of Victoriaâ€”I know only too well that services in rural and remote Australia are often missing or many miles away. The motivation for developing this policy stems from this government's election commitment to ensure the needs of people in rural and remote Australia are not forgotten. Unfortunately, often what makes good policy sense in a metropolitan context is impractical and unworkable in the country. Government must take account of this fact and frame policy accordingly. This is what the people of Australia who elected us, especially those in rural and remote areas, expect us to do.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This policy is a down payment on the coalition government's commitment to meet the requirements of veterans living in rural and remote areas. Of the 337,000 veterans, war widows and dependants currently entitled to health care through my department, over 31 per cent live outside the major metropolitan areas. It is in areas with smaller populations and in the remote locations that the problems are greatest. They often have none of the services the rest of us take for granted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition, although health care services may be lacking close to home, veterans may have considerable difficulty in travelling to the larger centres to receive appropriate care. The majority of veterans are now aged over 70 years. This ageing is creating further demand for a wider range of health care and support services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The veteran community also includes many younger veterans who served in Korea, Malaya, Vietnam and in more recent engagements including UN peacekeeping missions. Their needs and those of carers and indigenous veterans are quite different from those of older veterans.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This government is committed to honouring the debt of gratitude owed to those who fought for today's freedom. Rural Australia was a great source of recruitment. It is an important goal of this government to ensure
        <break page="5583" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         equity of access and entitlement to all veterans regardless of where they live.
        </break>

        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Health Policy for the Veteran Community in Rural and Remote Areas
        </emphasis>
        goes a great distance in achieving this goal. This policy:

       <para first-indent="16">

        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In short, this policy spells out what we can do to make health care services easier to get to, to promote awareness of preventive care measures and to improve our communications with the veteran community and health care providers. The policy looks to the total health service delivery framework including Commonwealth and state governments, private and community&amp;hyphen;based organisations, and looks to capitalise on opportunities for joint arrangements with them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This policy is about what is achievable and realistic. It comes up with practical solutions that we can implement now within budget constraints. It flags what we can do in future to enhance provision of health care for rural and remote veterans. It is, however, just the first stage.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Underpinning the development of this policy are wide ranging consultations with veterans, war widows, doctors, nurses, other health and community care providers, carers, ex&amp;hyphen;service organisations and others in Rockhampton, Thursday Island, Roma, Alice Springs, Bunbury, Geraldton, Cobar, Bourke and Echuca.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Consultations made clear that, veterans living in rural and remote areas cannot and generally do not expect to have the same level and range of locally available health care services as people who live in cities. The policy acknowledges this reality but, through better focusing and targeting of programs and services, I believe the veteran community can still expect the best possible deal.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Outlined in this policy are national, state and local initiatives, many of which are pilots, testing innovative approaches to service delivery and information provision. These have the potential to become the basis of practical, cost&amp;hyphen;effective, on&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;ground solutions right across the country.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I would now like to highlight a few examples of some of the initiatives. The veteran community told us that access to health care and support services is an issue of concern. At a national level my department will:

         â€”I did interject that earlier, Minister. The document which the minister has released, and which he gave me some access to earlier this afternoon, is indeed an excellent document in terms of drawing together those programs and those initiatives which have been announced in the budget and which have specifically targeted those people in rural and regional areas and remote areas.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no doubt, as the minister has said, that many peopleâ€”and veterans of course are specifically catered for in this statementâ€”living in those sorts of areas do have difficulties of access. They do have difficulties in the most basic forms of access to information. What the minister has announced todayâ€”with some of the extensions of the programs and pilot projects which he has also announcedâ€”hopefully will address many of those sorts of issues.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact that closer working relationships are also being investigated between the Commonwealth and states and local government and community organisations is a very logical extension of the way in which the various levels of government and community organisations that work in these areas bring some degree of information certainly, but also a degree of service, to veterans living in these areas. It is a very commendable suggestion.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no doubt that, when you look at opportunities to perhaps have one&amp;hyphen;stop shopsâ€”as the minister has rightly describedâ€”where veterans might come from more remote
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         areas to larger urban environments, they certainly have access to those sorts of sources of information and also expert advice in a whole range of areas, whether it be in health or in entitlements. The minister again uses an example of some of the benefits that perhaps people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background have not really accessed at this stage. I think it is important that that sort of information is made available.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Therefore, the fact that what the minister has announced is encapsulated in this one document is also very important. It is all part of a process where the communities in rural and remote areas of Australia do get equal access to information and do get equal access to the provision of services, whether it be medical advice, specialist attention or whatever. The minister indicated in his speech that most veterans today are around 70 or 75 years of age, with the exception of those who fought in the Korean war and those who fought more recently in Vietnam, in the Gulf conflict or wherever.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no doubt that many of those people do require some special services. There is no doubt that as people get older they do require a much higher level of care and there is a need for much greater responsibility being taken for them. The veterans system, which has been developed in this country at a bipartisan level over many years, I think is certainly the best in the Western world, if not the world, and offers support for those people that have given so much on behalf of their country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The goals which have been outlined in the minister's statement are very commendable indeed. I note that a number of the proposals he has outlined are pilot projects. I would hope that if those pilot projects prove to be successful then the information which the minister and his department gain will form the basis of the minister's submissions in coming ERC rounds next year leading up to the budget so that he can achieve what he did this time with some extension of funds to some programs in the area of veterans' affairs. If these projects in rural and remote Australia prove to be successful, then there is no reason to say that those principles need not apply in
        <break page="5588" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         other parts of Australia. Having spoken with the minister about these processes in the past, I think he probably has that idea in mind where, looking at the information that does come from the pilot projects, he will be able to do so.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I said, I think some of the accesses that are going to be provided through a variety of mechanisms in this health policy, particularly picking up Vietnam veterans' counselling services, annual health care plans and so on, are very commendable. There is no doubt that these sorts of plans, the advice network which is established and the various other services which go into rural and remote areas are going to be well received.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will comment briefly on the transport question. I think it is important that we recognise that whereas in urban environments, in major cities, the transport issue is not of major concern, clearly in rural and remote Australia it is. Whilst people in their twilight years do try to stay as long as they possibly can in their own accommodation, regrettably there may come a time when they need to have the benefit of nursing homes, hostel care or whatever. They get the best of that because of the system that is provided in this country. If you live in an urban environment, clearly you have a greater access to those facilities. On the other hand, if you are in rural and remote areas often it does mean tearing yourself away from family, friends and loved ones and going many miles away from what is your own known and local environment. The concept the minister outlined in his statement about providing transport options and so on to assist people as part of that process I think is very commendable.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no doubt that, as I have said, this policy is one which will be welcomed by all veterans in rural and remote areas of Australia. There is no doubt that it is something we on this side of the House certainly welcome. Regrettably, there are not as many members on this side of the House from rural and remote Australia these days as perhaps we would likeâ€”I fully understand why the people you commended in terms of who you consulted with came from your side of the parliamentâ€”but there is no doubt that a
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         number of our senators in particular that do look after rural and remote Australia will welcome this policy statement. I think it is something we in this parliament will all commend you for.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me conclude where I started, by again saying that policy statements such as this, where the bipartisan nature of the veterans' affairs portfolio can be demonstrated, make it easy to accept recommendations that flow from them. I thank the minister for making the policy statement available to me for a couple of hours before he tabled itâ€”actually a little longer because of the proceedings of the House today, which gave me a chance to read it several times. It has proven to be a great initiative and I commend him and the government for taking this step.

        This is the principal bill in a package of three bills which implement a number of the government's important policy initiatives within the immigration and multicultural affairs portfolio. The measures contained within the bill are consistent with the government's commitments to better manage the migration program, to increase cost recovery in this portfolio and to enhance the value of Australian citizenship.

        Firstly, this bill seeks to provide the government with the authority to deliver a planned, orderly and balanced migration program. To be able to do so, the government must have the authority to determine the number of people in each category of the migration program. This is not possible under the current legislation.

        It is Australia's sovereign right to decide the total level of immigration to Australia. It is also Australia's sovereign right to decide the balance between the various immigration categories. The proposed amendments will enable the government of the day to determine, if necessary, the number of people in every migration category able to enter Australia each year. The amendments will thus assist the government to implement its migration program, announced on 3 July, and will contribute to the restoration of the balance between the family and skilled streams

In the context of the Lindsay by-election, which we are going to be dealing with in a very short period of time, it demonstrates the unwillingness of this opposition to grasp very reasonable prospects to ensure that this migration program can be delivered in the way in which it has been announced.

        Members will recall that in 1995-96, Labor allowed the immigration program to get seriously out of control and out of balance. The family stream had grown by 27 per cent in 1995-96. It had come to represent almost 70 per cent of the migration program. The spouse category had grown by 32 per cent, and the number of parents had increased by 74 per cent in that year alone.

However, even the best planning cannot predict every possible variation in the number of visa applications that will be made for the many different visa classes.

        These amendments will enhance the ability to manage the program by allowing applications to be carried over into the next financial year. The only mechanism currently available requires the termination of existing applications. The new provisions would have the effect that, in some years, visa issue in some parts of the family stream may be queued into the following year. This is a much more equitable outcome for these parts of the program.

        In order to minimise inconvenience to the bulk of persons affected, it is essential that the government can undertake this finetuning in the most flexible and equitable manner possible.

        I note that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has indicated that the opposition supports the level of the program the government has announced. The achievement of that program level, and the restoration of the balance between the family and skilled categories that is the key to community support for the program, requires all the measures contained in this bill.

        As recently reiterated by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the government is absolutely committed to a migration program that operates on a non&amp;hyphen;discriminatory basis. The measures in this bill are completely consistent with that principle and enable the government to deliver a planned, orderly and balanced migration program.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government is concerned at evidence that too many visas in the past have been
        <break page="5591" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         granted on the basis of relationships that are not bona fide. Such abuse threatens the integrity of the migration program by allowing the entry of people who would not otherwise be eligible for migration. It also operates unfairly by taking up places in the migration program which might otherwise have been given to people who satisfy the criteria for other visa classes.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition's immigration policy statement clearly signalled our intention to introduce measures to reduce the abuse of migration based on fabricated or non&amp;hyphen;bona fide relationships. These measures are the extension of the current two&amp;hyphen;year probationary period for onshore applicants to offshore applicants, limiting serial sponsorships, more rigorous assessment procedures, and requiring a two&amp;hyphen;year cohabitation period for de facto and interdependency relationships. Each of these measures is integral to the overall success of the package in reducing abuse of Australia's migration program. To fail to pass any one measure puts at risk the government's migration program numbers and its composition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A key feature of migration entitlements based upon relationships must be that those involved have a long&amp;hyphen;term commitment to each other. Short term or transitory relationships should not provide non&amp;hyphen;Australians with the lifelong right to live in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is therefore a major defect in the existing legislation that it does not impose a minimum period of cohabitation in order for people to qualify for a visa to migrate on the grounds of being the de facto spouse of an Australian citizen sponsor. As a result, visa applications are being made where couples have only been together for short periods, sometimes only a matter of a few weeks. Such relationships can provide very little evidence of the necessary long&amp;hyphen;term commitment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        An evaluation of onshore spouse provisions at the beginning of this year provided empirical evidence that this is an area of concern, with de facto relationships being twice as likely as de jure marriages to break down during visa processing alone. The government considers that requiring evidence of a relationship that has existed for at least two years
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         is necessary to ensure that only couples who have already demonstrated their long&amp;hyphen;term commitment can be granted a visa. The provisions in the bill will enable regulations to be made establishing a two&amp;hyphen;year cohabitation requirement and enabling exceptions to occur to that requirement where there are good reasons for doing so. For example, the government does not propose to require two years' cohabitation if there are children from the relationship.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government considers that it is unnecessary to impose a two&amp;hyphen;year requirement on married couples because of the different legal consequences of marriage. This amendment will mean that the migration regulations will be able to specify the nature and incidents of the relationship between two people which are required to establish a `de facto' relationship, notwithstanding the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. It was outlined in the coalition's election commitment that de facto spouses will be required to cohabit for a period of two years before their relationship can be recognised for the purpose of visa applications. As there will be no similar requirement for married spouses, such a provision would create a distinction on the grounds of marital status, and this is presently prohibited by the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. This amendment will exempt the migration regulations from the effect of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in so far as it applies to the status or condition of being the married or the de facto spouse of another person.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I note that, in relation to the grant of visas, interdependency relationships are not covered by the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 or any other equivalent Commonwealth legislation. As a result, no amendments are required to principal legislation to enable regulations to be made requiring a minimum two&amp;hyphen;year cohabitation period for those relationships.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="5592" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         The government believes that the mischief of bogus and short&amp;hyphen;term relationships is sufficiently serious to warrant an exception being made to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 for visa applications based on de facto spouse relationships. We believe that this measure will contribute to the range of initia tives we are taking to renew public confidence in the integrity of this component of the migration program.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I shall now turn to the provisions relating to the proposed visa application charge. The government considers that the present system of payments for Australian visas is unnecessarily complex. Not only is there a visa application fee, but some applicants are also liable to pay the English education charge and the health services charge. These fees and charges are imposed and collected under three separate pieces of legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The present system also imposes a burden on Australian taxpayers because the indirect costs to government of handling visa applications and providing post&amp;hyphen;settlement services cannot be recovered on a fee for service basis. This means that a proportion of government services that are provided to visa applicants are currently funded from general taxation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This situation is not consistent with the government's stated election policy that `the coalition endorses . . . cost recovery of immigration procedures and services . . . to ensure that taxpayers are not called on to subsidise the processing of applications for migration.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government proposes to simplify the processing of payments for visa applications by implementing a single visa application charge that will be payable by applicants for visas. This will be imposed by the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996. The new charge will replace the existing system of visa application fees, the English education charge and the health services charge. The new scheme is very closely modelled on the existing charge schemes, which were introduced by the previous government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Valid visa applications that are made before the commencement of the visa application charge will continue to be subject to the existing fee and charging arrangements. The visa application charge is designed to recover both direct and indirect costs of processing visa applications, and to recover an increased proportion of the cost of providing post&amp;hyphen;arrival and settlement services to permanent visa holders.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amount of the charge will be prescribed in the migration regulations and will be subject to the ceiling set out in the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996. A similar legislative ceiling mechanism is already in use for both of the charges that currently apply to visa applications. The regulations will reflect the fee and charges settings already announced in the budget context.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There will be appropriate flexibility to exempt certain persons from the application charge, or from part of the application charge. In some circumstances, such as refugee and humanitarian applicants, the charge will be nil. The regulations will also provide for waiver of the charge and for refunds in appropriate circumstances.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill also amends the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 to ensure that a person is permitted to have only one entitlement of up to 510 hours of English language tuition under that act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The final measures in this bill relate to Australian citizenship. The government is strongly committed to recognising the national significance of Australian citizenship. It represents our commitment to a common future and formal membership of the Australian community, and brings with it the responsibilities and privileges of that membership.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government remains firmly committed to the general principle that a person granted citizenship after making a full and frank disclosure of all relevant factors should be on an equal footing with any other Australian citizens.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the government is equally determined that the value of Australian citizenship should not be undermined by allowing the grant of citizenship to stand where it has been granted as the result of fraud or deception. Yet the current provisions for deprivation of Australian citizenship in these circumstances are limited.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break page="5593" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          There is currently no provision for depriving a person of Australian citizenship if it was obtained by fraud at the time of immigration. For example, a person who migrated to Australia on spouse grounds cannot be de prived of citizenship if it is later discovered that there was never any intention of a genuine union. Also, a person who committed fraud when applying for citizenship cannot be deprived of that citizenship if prosecution for the fraud is not commenced within ten years of its occurrence.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government considers that this is unacceptable. People should not be able to hide behind Australian citizenship which was obtained following fraud. To allow them to do so weakens the meaning and value of Australian citizenship.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Therefore, in accordance with the government's pre&amp;hyphen;election policy commitment, the proposed amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 and the Migration Act 1958 will allow deprivation, without time limitation, of future grants of Australian citizenship obtained as a result of fraud, whether at the time of immigration or of application for citizenship. I commend the bill to the House.

        The English education charge is prescribed by regulations which are subject to a statutory ceiling. The bill will increase this ceiling to $5,500â€”a figure which more accurately reflects the true cost of providing English language tuition to migrants who do not have functional English.

        The raised ceiling is consistent with the government's election commitment to achieve greater cost recovery for migration&amp;hyphen;related services.

         â€”When my speech on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill was interrupted prior to question time, I was referring to information provided by the New South Wales Minister for Education and Training, the Hon. John Aquilina. My speech related to cuts in funding to TAFE. About 40,000 of these students would have been attending labour market program courses in TAFE institutions outside Sydney during the next four years. In country areas, where the majority of labour market programs were run by TAFE, unemployment runs from two to five times the urban rate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        TAFE institutes statewide have estimated that the cuts in labour market programs will cost each of them between $2 million and $6 million this financial year. Institutes can expect to lose between $1 million and $2 million per year in salaries and operating costs. TAFE campuses will also suffer from a $25 million total reduction in funds for building works during the next three years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The funding cuts to TAFE will clearly add severe strains to a system which is beginning to buckle under the loss of labour market programs. To further emphasise the point, I again refer to information provided by the New South Wales state Minister for Education and Training. The document is a press release, and it reads:

        That is a fairly big impact. Many of the activities of TAFE in training our young people both in direct courses and in labour market programs associated courses must now be under great threat. We simply will be unable to expect TAFE to deliver training programs to assist our young people into the work force when they are unable to provide staff and equipment to do so.

        Does the government perhaps wish to go back to another era when our grandfathers had to have their parents pay employers for the privilege of having an apprenticeship and be trained? Surely that is not in the Howard government's thinking. How are young people to get their training unless it is to become the sole responsibility of each set of parents?

        The numbers of have&amp;hyphen;nots are going to become greater and greater. Australia has been a marvellous country in the past and its people have never begrudged paying as a collective group for the collective gain of all its people. The new policies that are emerging via this bill and so many other parts of the government policies make it clear that what we are being redirected to think about is only `What is in it for me?' and `How can I get an advantage without helping my next door neighbour?'

        What about the students at places like Evans High School at Blacktown, Blacktown Boys and Girls High, John Paul II and all the other 11 high schools in the electorate of Greenway or the 36 primary schools? What training future can they expect if TAFE is to be so cut and restricted? Are we now to expect that mum and dad are going to be slugged, that they will have to find buckets of money to pay for their children's TAFE training? Do the children now also have to go and try to negotiate a contract under the new workplace relations bill to earn a dollar to help mum and dad pay the TAFE fees? Can you just imagine the types of contracts that these young people will be forced to sign, born out of their desperation to get TAFE training? In its submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, the Brotherhood of St Laurence said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The very real problems for young unemployed is that there remain too few jobs for those who want to work and there appears to be little prospect of change in this situation. It is of enormous concern to us that the government seems to have abandoned its commitment to the goal of returning Australia to full employment and indeed has no targets for reducing unemployment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that in this area of TAFE cuts it is clear that not only has the government abandoned the unemployed, as so eloquently stated by the Brotherhood of St Laurence, but it appears to have abandoned any pretence of support for a community supported training system in the long run.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government tries every economic trick in the book to fiddle the statistics in an attempt to hide its appalling behaviour in this area. But the fact remains that it has cut $66.25 million from vocational education training grants to the states and territories. It has reduced the Australian National Training Authority's operating expenses by $12.81 million. There has also been a reduction of $91.41 million, representing the abolition of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the five per cent real growth on base recurrent TAFE funding. This amounts to the challengeable figure of $170.5 million that this government has cut from vocational education and training.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government says that it supports traineeships and apprenticeships, yet in the traineeship area it shows up quite clearly that there is to be a steady cutting of funds in this area, as exposed in item 2 of schedule 1 of this bill. The Australian trainee system was one of the most imaginative schemes ever introduced in this country and has provided training and jobs in so many varied areas of Australian life for thousands of young people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Traineeships cover many occupations that were not previously covered by apprenticeships and were an excellent way for small business to train new employees in the specific skills those employers required. Now we are starting to wind it back. What an indictment of any government that allows such things to happen to the very people it pretends to care aboutâ€”the young, the unemployed and the training hungry youth of this nation. Add to this the $1.8 billion cuts in labour market programs. No amount of wriggling or misuse of statistics can enable the government to escape from our scrutiny.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the issues that has been raised in this debate by people on the other side has been unfair dismissals. They have failed to understand that, in the area of labour market programs, the new work opportunities and traineeships that fall under the national training wage were not affected by the unfair dismissal provisions of the previous arbitration act.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is our intention to hold the government clearly responsible for the absolute downgrading of training for our young people seeking work and those who will be shortly seeking work. The debate on this bill, which exposes its cuts to TAFE and its many ramifications, enables us to expose its nonsense. I can assure the House that those who were so swayed by the Howard rhetoric prior to the election are now clearly regretting their decision to support the government.

        The problem for the government now is that it can no longer hide its meanness and unfair

         programs behind its attack on the previous government. It now has to stand up and be counted on its own policies and performances. So far on every countâ€”whether it be ministerial standards, child care, nursing homes, the unemployed, labour market programs, racial discrimination or TAFE trainingâ€”it comes a miserable and lamented last, which is where it has always belonged.

         â€”I rise tonight to address the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1996. Vocational education and training is a very important topic in the dying years of the 20th century. It is important for Australia because we need to do our very best to give our young people skills that will take them forward into the next century, skills that they can use in industry, skills which are portable, skills which are realistic and skills which are relevant.

        It seems to me that some of the things that we just heard from the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) need to be discussed. The member for Greenway says that this government has no object to increase employment and, in fact, it is acting to increase unemployment. I reject those comments in the strongest possible terms.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This government when it came to power found an untenable budget situation. Fair dinkum, how can you keep on year after year spending money that you do not earn? If the member for Greenway tried to run his household that way, I think he would find that, firstly, he would lose his furniture, his lawn mower, his car, his TV set and then, finally, his house because you cannot keep spending forever what you have not earned, what you do not have. So we have to live within our means as a nation.

         If there is one thing that will help boost employment in this nation, it is to get high interest rates off our back, get high interest rates done and finished with. If we have to live with a high interest rate regime for the remaining years of the 1990s to 2000 and beyond, then we will find that industry, business and commerce simply give up the hard job of trying to expand their operations and trying to compete with companies over seas that supply the same products and the same services that they do.

        When ANTA was conceived, it was done on the run. As I recall, the then Prime Minister got himself involved in this debate in 1992 ahead of the 1993 election. He finally came up with this convoluted method of taking money from the states and putting it into a new bureaucracyâ€”the Australian National Training Authority. The Commonwealth government put their money into the same bureaucracy, and then ANTA distributed the funds back to the states and to the individual TAFE organisations via the state. I was highly sceptical that this mechanism would be effective. In fact, it has worked, and I respect the work that ANTA does. They do a good job, and they are helping us to help the system devolve in nature.

        I have mentioned before that the Outer Eastern College of TAFE, which is just on the border of my electorate, has done some highly innovative work with industry, for instance, with Mercedes Benz.

        Then Mercedes Benz turned around and paid TAFE instructors to leave the college, go to the plant itself, work on the assembly line itself, actually assembling trucks and training employees in assembly techniques. That was highly innovative. TAFE, in that institution, was acting as a private provider for a private company in order to enhance the skills of the private company's employees. I applaud them for that. We need flexible institutions. We need flexibility across the system.

        I recall that back in 1990 some of our private training institutions in Victoria trained apprentices or trainees and then had to send them off to TAFE in order to have them examined to see if they had learned what their curriculum was supposed to have taught them. It was an absolute nonsense. There was no reason on earth why the private provider could not be credentialled to certify what young people had achieved and what their skill levels were. ANTA receives the money and ANTA distributes it. It seems to me that what we have now is an increasingly flexible system, where states are starting to compete with each other for the prize of who is doing the job best, who can get more people into active training programs and who has real outputs that gets people real jobs.

As I said before when I referred to the Finn report, we cannot send every child to university. So, if we aim to send 25 per cent or 30 per cent of our young people on to university, that is a wonderful objective. The rest need skills.

        What this government is all aboutâ€”particularly with the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system and some of the new innovative programs that we are putting into placeâ€”is increasing the flexibility of the system to allow people to do what they believe is best to achieve the highest outcome. An important ingredient in all of this is to give industry a real voice in curriculum, standards and what they expect of performers. It is a nonsense if we have one government financed institutionâ€”let us say, Oxblinn TAFE in Outer Woop Woopâ€”saying, `We know better than our employers what skills the young people need.' That is an attitude that has been around for a while. Thank goodness that attitude is disappearing rapidly. The TAFEs have woken up and realised that industry, business and commerce are the sectors hiring the people. They know what skills they need now, and they should have the vision to know what skills they are going to need in the future.

        The nature of work is changing so rapidly. The member for Greenway talked about our current inquiry into the factors influencing the employment of young people. Many people have told us that the whole nature of industry is shifting. I recall that the Banking and Insurance Industry Advisory Training Board came along and talked to us. One of the things that really fascinated meâ€”I had not thought about it beforeâ€”is that there are not very many jobs in the banking industry or in insurance offices any more. I recall that 20 years agoâ€”and I am sure you do, Madam Deputy Speakerâ€”if a young person left school at 15 or 16 they were almost assured employment in a bank or in an insurance

         office. As long as they had reasonable English skills and reasonable literary and numeracy skills, they could go along to a bank or an insurance office and learn to be a teller, a clerk or a clerk/typist. They would start off on a junior wage and gradually progress over time with the organisation. Those days are gone. With modern electronic banking and the way the insurance industry has evolved, technology has taken over. Those kinds of jobs are just not with us any more. Young people who want to get into those industries now need to follow a skills training path that gives them the relevant qualifications that those industries are looking for.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All sectors of our educational establishment are now focusing more on skill acquisition than I believe they have ever done in the past. This, of course, includes schools, TAFEs, universities and private providers out in the private marketplace. It is the intention of this government to allow them as much flexibility as possibleâ€”without imposing draconian bureaucratic control on themâ€”to set their own course structures which meet industry and minimum standards. It is also the intention of the government to allow them to increase the level of flexible vocational education and training in schools, whether it is apprenticeship programs, whether it is traineeship programs or whether it is simply the schools programs themselves. Whether they are old tech schools or whether they are modern schools dedicated to academic studies, they will gradually take on some aspects of vocational training in their curriculum. They might add business studies or computer studies. They might, for instance, offer some of their young people an introduction to communications or the media. If they are really innovative, they might go back and pick up some of our old crafts and trades. They might pick up carpentry, automotive skills, fitting and turning, horticulture or hospitality skills, which is a growing course in high schools.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The focus on skills acquisition has shifted remarkably in the last few years. We have shifted it back into secondary schools. There is no uniformity across the states in this respect. Every state is treating this issue
        <break page="5600" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         differently and every state is coming up with different bureaucratic mechanisms. I suspect that that is positive. Those who are most successful will have the best outcome in getting their young people jobs in their state. The other states will then say, `Hey, what a good example that is to follow. I'd better do something about changing my system too.' The days are gone when we could have government funded institutions with huge bureaucracies trying on a day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day basis to direct how people are taught and directing their skill acquisition.

        One of the aspects of that on which I think this government is doing an excellent jobâ€”and I note the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is in the House, and I congratulate him on thisâ€”is the modern apprenticeship and traineeship system. Essentially, it is all about allowing industry to help set the pace for training provision.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no sense in having a 35&amp;hyphen;page book on the curriculum that is necessary for a structured course in fitting and turning that says, `This is exactly what you have to learn because somebody learned that 35 years ago.' Today there is a need for a more flexible course where you learn some aspects of mechanics. Perhaps you need to know a bit about carpentry and electrics too in the kind of job you will be going into.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So we will introduce into the system some flexibility to allow the industry advisory training boards to more quickly approve new courses, new structures, and allow them to be certified so people can get on with offering advanced and enhanced skills training. At the same time, it will offer young people the opportunity to go to work for an employer and the employer decides, `I'd like for you to accelerate the course you are doing. I want you to be fully qualified in two years instead of three.' You know we are moving to competency based training and away from time based training, and that is very positive.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So the new system would allow the employer, in agreement with his employee, perhaps to have the employee at work three days and at school two days. If he wanted him to do it quickly, the employee could have two days at work and three days at school,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and why not? If the young person under that system cannot earn enough to live on, the government will pick up the tab to make sure they have minimum wages, which will allow them a reasonable living standard. Increased flexibility is what this government is all about to offer high quality training to young people and to adults more relevant to industry, business and commerce so we can help promote new jobs, new opportunities and give people the opportunity at satisfying employment.

        Since I have been in the chamber and fortunate enough to hear the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) making his remarks, could I just thank him again for the very broad vision and deep knowledge that he brings to this subject.

        The bill before the House represents a very firm commitment on behalf of the Commonwealth to maintain a strong vocational education and training sector.

Australian businesses are competing in that global economy now on a daily basis.

         It is critical that Australians be able to bring to the workplace, to their employment, skills and knowledge which are equal to the best in the world. The government's programs in this area are designed to ensure that young Australians coming into the work force, leaving school, in the work force or who have been out of the work force for a significant time and who are wishing to re-enter the work force, have access to a training system where the quality of training is world's best. We talk about world's best practice in terms of our industries. We also have to think about world's best practice in terms of our training system.

         A significant feature of this bill, to which the member for La Trobe drew attention, is the fact that it increases expenditure through the Australian National Training Authority on vocational education and training over the years covered by the bill. It is true that the bill does incorporate some cuts against forward estimates. These reflect the unfortunate fact that when this government came into office it found itself faced with a budget deficit of over $10 billion. Quite clearly, this deficit could not be allowed to continue for the health of the Australian economy, for the wellbeing of Australian businesses and for the future employment prospects of Australians. It had to be addressed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The savings issue had to be addressed. We did that. We went carefully through every sector of expenditure to ensure that the way in which these savings would be made would be fully consistent with the objectives of the government. In this area, as I say, the objectives are designed to ensure that we continue to build up the quality of our training system and expand the opportunities for Australians, young and old, to participate within this system. Therefore, the vocational education and training expenditure was not quarantined in these discussions and certain efficiency cuts were made to the forward estimates.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Despite this, expenditure by the government in this area will grow under this piece of legislation. I draw particular attention to the fact that, for the 1997 year, there will continue to be $70 million of growth funding in the budget. All the growth funding which has
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          been put into the budget for vocational education and training over the last few years is retained in the base for funding this very crucial area of government activity.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In the debate the claim was made by the shadow minister for education and youth affairs, the member for Sydney, that the previous government had made significant progress in this areaâ€”and I was pleased to get his broad support for much of what the present government is doing. I am pleased to acknowledge that there were reforms made by the previous government in the training area which we supported and are pleased to build on. I refer particularly to the move to competency based training in industry, which we see as being a key reform to breaking away from the traditional time based character of apprenticeships and traineeships in particular. It will certainly help Australian industry to focus its training effort on the specific skills that are required and to deliver these skills in the most efficient and effective way possible.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfortunately, the systems set in place by the previous government did become exceedingly complex. Many businesses were put off from accessing the training system because of the duplication between the Commonwealth and states, with the need to get approvals at both levels of government; and the complexity of the procedures which had been laid down, including the persistence of old, very outdated procedures such as the declaration of vocations which dates from Victorian England and which, unfortunately, was left in place by the previous government alongside the reforms to the training system which it did put in place.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the other elements of the previous government's policies in this area, I believe regrettably, was to link the training system very closely to the industrial relations system. While I understand that a political party which represents the trade union movement in this parliament would want to do that, the consequence of doing so was that many small businessesâ€”most of whom, of course, do not have unionised workplacesâ€”perceived the traineeship system as being one which was supervised by the trade union movement. They were unwilling to bring a trainee into
         <break page="5602" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the workplace because they feared that to do so would also be to bring a union into the workplace and to subject themselves to pressure for the unionisation of the business.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think it is important we recognise that, if business is to have a sense of ownership of the training system, if the training is to be appropriate, it has to be a system which is seen by businesses as being accessible to them and one which is divorced from the complexities of the industrial relations arrangements. The provisions that the present government is putting in place, particularly through the workplace relations legislation in the Senate, will ensure that this is so, and under that legislation training arrangements and agreements will be able to be approved by training authorities, not industrial relations authorities. That will be a very significant step towards breaking the nexus between the industrial relations system and the training system. The consequence of that, we believe, will be that the small and medium sized business sector will be much more willing to enter into some of these training arrangements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government is, of course, placing a great deal of emphasis on reform of the apprenticeship and traineeship system. Again regrettably, over the last 13 years the apprenticeship system was largely left on the shelf as an out-of&amp;hyphen;date, time based system confined to traditional trades and subject, as indeed all training arrangements were, to the process of the declaration of vocations which was established over a century agoâ€”and which is really the old, outdated system of training which the new national training arrangements are designed to replace.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am pleased to say that in our discussions with the states we have been able to get some very important agreements within the national training framework to move the system away from its rigidities and out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;date features, modernise it, bring it up to date and simplify it. One of these has been the agreement of the states to move, from the beginning of 1998, to a system of user choice for off&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;job training associated with apprenticeships. From that time all states have agreed they will have in place arrangements under which the off-
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the-job training for an apprenticeship can be chosen by the employer and the trainee. They will be able to choose that from the appropriate providerâ€”that is, the provider who they believe will offer them the customised and tailored package of off&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;job training which will best help their business. The public dollar will flow to that provider, whether a publicly funded TAFE college or institute, or a private provider.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At the most recent meeting of the state ministers, we were also able to get agreement from every state, except New South Wales, on the abolition of the old process of the declaration of vocations and to put the whole national training system on a completely new and consistent basis within a national framework under the National Training Authority. I regret the fact that New South Wales has not agreed so far to take that step. It has not taken it for perhaps two very simple reasons.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One reason is that the Trades and Labour Council in New South Wales is putting enormous pressure on the minister in that state not to agree to reforms of the Commonwealth government at this time; secondly, the New South Wales Premier, Mr Carr, has apparently issued directions to his ministers that they are not to agree to anything that requires legislation. The stasis that is therefore developing in New South Wales, the freeze on development and modernisation of the system, is of great concern to the business community in that state. I have no doubt at all that the New South Wales government will be hearing, in no uncertain terms, from both national and state business organisations about their attitude, their refusal to move with the rest of Australia towards the further modernisation of the training system.

        <para first-indent="16">
         These have been very significant moves taken by the new government. They have been taken because we are determined that young people in Australia will have access to training which leads to real jobs. Perhaps one of the clearest conclusions of the Jobs for Young Australians conference, which occurred in Adelaide in August last year during the time of the previous government, was the very strong resolution out of that conference by the young people there that they were sick
         <break page="5603" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          and tired of being recycled through short-term, six-month training programs which did not lead on to jobs but which left them back at the end of the unemployment queue. The evaluation of Working Nation did show that for most of these programs unfortunately a majority of young people did go back onto unemployment queues.

         We just cannot continue with this situation. They were very expensive programs and they did not work.

         Part of the reforms, therefore, that are being undertaken out of the expenditure that is dealt with within this legislation is an agreement by the states to use $20 million of the 1997 allocation specifically to encourage the development of vocational education in schools. At the present time, something like 30 per cent of students in the senior years do not complete year 12. They drop out before the end of year 12. Of those who do complete year 12, some 30 to 40 per cent do not go on to university or full&amp;hyphen;time TAFE. In other words, only a minority of the students in the senior years of schooling go on in the academic stream.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It remains a factâ€”in some ways an unfortunate fact, although we certainly want to encourage students who have the desire and the capacity to go on through that academic streamâ€”that our schools have been encouraged in recent years to compete with each other according to the TE scores that their students get. What that says is that schools are judged by the number of their students who go on to university.

        Beaches and oceans have long provided Australians with free leisure. We have discovered recently that the coasts can also provide some real economic benefit. Since commercial whaling activities were banned in Australian waters, there has been rapid development of the whole new industry of whale watching. The industry now contributes $9.3 million annually to the economy.

         In keeping with the promise we made to govern for all Australians, there will be assistance to reverse the degradation of farm lands. Farmers in this country are forced to do it tough because of the unfortunate regularity of drought. On many occasions, it is only a flood that brings relief. This of course places great strain on farmers to maximise their production when they are able to which, in turn, places pressure on the land.

         An Industry Commission study has estimated that billions of hectares of Australian agricultural land is degraded and requires treatment. Just how many billions is hard to tell because the research process has been progressive and rather drawn out with some of the data as much as a quarter of a century old. Degradation costs the nation about $1.5 billion each year in lost production. That is about the equivalent of six per cent of agricultural output.

          John F. Kennedy gave a speech to the University of California at Berkeley in 1962 about world peace and how the clamour of daily events tends to interfere with our view of the great movements of history. To illustrate his point, he told the story of the French marshal who once asked his gardener to plant a tree. The gardener complained, telling him that the tree was slow to grow and would take a century to reach full maturity. `In that case,' the marshal said, `there is no time to lose. Plant it this afternoon.' President Kennedy concluded his speech with words that are perhaps even more appropriate to this issue than to his: `We have no time to lose, let us plant our trees this afternoon.'

         â€”The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill seeks to establish the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, into which it is proposed that part of the proceeds of the sale of one-third of Telstra will be paid. It is intended that these proceeds will fund very important environmental projects, such as the national vegetation initiative, the national land and water resource audit, the Murray-Darling project, the national river care initiative, the coasts and clean seas initiative, and the national reserve system for biodiversity.

        These are essential programs, necessary for the protection and repair of Australia's natural environment. They are initiatives that were committed to by the previous Labor government. They were committed to as part of the normal budgetary processes of government, as any area of government activity should be, and were not made contingent upon the sale of Telstra. This makes a mockery of the government's claim that the trust projects are somehow innovative or even their own idea.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The conserving natural Australia package announced by the previous Labor government committed $173 million for the protection of biodiversity in Australia, including $80 million over four years for the national reserve system. This is the same $80 million that the government would have one believe is some innovative idea to be funded from the trust.

Under the previous government's sustaining rural Australia policy an extra $176&amp;half; million had been earmarked for the landcare program. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you well know, landcare is about getting local involvement in the repair of degradation and taking measures to have the individual land users bear responsibility for the way that they utilise the land. The main challenge is to educate land users that they must adopt practices which ensure that the land is treated as a sustainable resource.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The success of landcare demonstrates that funded groups `at the coalface' are often best placed to tackle these major problems. The government has allocated $8 million to landcare in the budget. The rest of the funding is conditional on Telstra's sale. Full landcare funding must come unconditionally from consolidated revenue and not rely on the sale of Telstra. As a core function of government, landcare funding should come from the budget.

The various levels of government of the federation had already spent $300 million on this protect. The initiative covers 1.6 million square kilometres, one-seventh of the area of the continent. It is the largest integrated catchment program of its kind. The aims of the Murray&amp;hyphen;Darling Basin initiative are the promotion and coordination of planning and management to make sure that the land and water resources of the basin can be used sustainably. It is another core project and it should continue to be funded as part of the normal budget process, not have its future made contingent on the sale of Telstra.

         The difference between the government and the opposition on these issues is in the strength of the commitment to the environment.

         The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) claimed in his second reading speech that this bill `demonstrates this government's commitment to ensuring a cleaner, greener and more sustainably productive Australia'.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Should the sale of Telstra not proceed, there is no commitment to any of these worthwhile programs. It is ironic that the government now parades itself as some kind of environmental guardian, given the coalition's woeful track record on major environmental issues in the past and its lack of commitment to the environment in the budget. The list of steps undertaken by the previous Labor government
         <break page="5611" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that were opposed by the coalition is seemingly endless. Logging in the wet tropics would never have stopped; the Franklin would have been flooded; and mining at Kakadu would have been allowed to proceed, as it seems it might yet. Is the vastly reduced environment program of the department to be the only environmental expenditure if the Natural Heritage Trust is not established? One might ask, Mr Deputy Speaker.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The level of expenditure on the environment that we can expect from the trust is a matter of grave concern. In his second reading speech the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy spoke of an initial capital of $1 billion. However, there is no commitment in this bill for a replenishment of the trust once the nearly $700 million proposed in these measures has been exhausted. Only $300 million is to remain in the trust and, presumably, the interest from this money would finance additional environmental schemes. Is this to be the only expenditure on the environment? Are environmental initiatives ever again going to be funded from the budget? If not, the interest on the remaining $300 million in the trust would be sadly inadequate to provide for all the environmental programs necessary for Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill also raises serious questions about the government's philosophy in committing funds to important national responsibilities. It is inevitable, given its pathological obsession with privatisation for privatisation's sake, that the government will attempt at some stage in the future to divest itself of its remaining shares in Telstra. Indeed, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) has already confirmed this. When the government tries to do so, will it also try to link that sale with some other government outlay? Will the government try to link that sale with the Commonwealth's obligations to, say, the health system, or to aged care or transport provisions?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This attempt to generate a link between the sale of Telstra and the funding of a series of government programs establishes a dangerous precedent. Will the day come when the parliament is blackmailed into supporting

         Even while the government is attempting to dream up environmental credentials for itself, the budget tells a different story. Environmental organisations such as the Australian Conservation Foundation have expressed their reservations about the trust simply replacing the money already cut from environmental programs. As Michael Krockenberger from the ACF said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The billion dollars of course has to be funded in its own right. It can't simply be a case of replacing other cuts.
        </para>
        <para>
         Yet with the inclusion of projects that had already been committed, combined with the cuts to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, this is precisely what it amounts to. In the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Lateline
         </emphasis>
         interview I referred to earlier, Professor Kitching says he is concerned that, because of the trust, the usual recurrent funding will just `drift away in future years'. The Minister for the Environment responded:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         That would be wrong and that won't occur.
        </para>
        <para>
         But the budget papers seem to indicate otherwise. The funding drift appears to be occurring anyway, whether the trust is established or not. The total environment program within the environment, sport and territories portfolio has suffered a dramatic cut from $212.3 million spent in the last financial year to $96.2 million in four years time, in the year 1999&amp;hyphen;2000. This represents a massive cut of some $116 million over four years in the annual expenditure. But if we go to a table which is appendix 2 on page 35 of the document entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Investing our natural heritage: a statement by Senator the Honourable Robert Hill, Minister for the Environment
         </emphasis>
         , released on budget night, we can look at the decline in funding over the next four years. The decline in funding in the environment portfolio alone in those four years, including this financial year as the first year, is some $268.9 million. That is not even looking at the decline in the funding that we would find in the primary industries portfolio which would cover such things as the Murray&amp;hyphen;Darling Basin expenditure, landcare expenditure and other expenditures. If we match that large
         <break page="5612" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          amount of money against the amount of money proposed to be spent out of the trust fund, we start to see that, as Professor Kitching says, funding will just drift away in future years.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Among the cuts in the budget are the $5 million cut to the Australian Heritage Commission, mainly because of the discontinuation of the state and territory component of the national estate grants program. This small component of the NEGP allowed people to work locally on projects of state and territory significance to protect and conserve the environment. None of the projects included for funding under this program are included in those to be funded by the Natural Heritage Trust. So the government cannot even claim that the trust measures will replace this program.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian Nature Conservation Agency has been slashed by $36.1 million over the next four years. This agency declares and manages parks and reserves on Commonwealth owned or leased land and in Commonwealth waters.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So, while the government trots out the line that the Natural Heritage Trust is the greatest environmental undertaking ever, it shows its true colours by seeking to implement severe cuts to the environment programs of the department. These cuts demonstrate that little has changed in the coalition's attitude to the environment over the years. Each of the projects covered by the trust are worth whileâ€”I do not think that in the course of this debate there has been any argument about thatâ€”and they deserve to be funded in their own right, not made dependent on the sale of Telstra. They are core initiatives that require to be funded off the core budget.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the real concerns about the way in which environmental funding has been treated in the budget is that the promised additional $84 million for the environment in this financial year 1996&amp;hyphen;97 was to be seen as a transitional arrangement before the take&amp;hyphen;up of the proposed trust. Not even that was fulfilled
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          in the budget. So we have this contradiction that, because the government believes that the Natural Heritage Trust is in doubt because of actions of the Senate, it will not even put forward the full $84 million that it promised.

         If we go to Budget Paper No. 1 and look at `Environment protection' on page 3-125, we see a footnote against a number of the items for funding for the year 1996&amp;hyphen;97. Footnote (e) says:

         Those programs include the national feral animal control strategy, the national weed strategy, funding for the national landcare projects, the Murray-Darling 2001 project and additional funding to improve natural resources management. As I have said, these are programs each of which stands in its own right and should be funded. They should be funded now. The whole question of environmental funding, as some commentators have said, should not be put into some sort of holding pattern, as if problems of getting the Senate to agree with measures has first arrived this year under this government.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It has been a recurring problem over many years and was a recurring problem for the previous government. This government should have taken it into account. It should not be used as an excuse for not providing in this financial year sufficient funding for environmental protection to be able to continue programs that have been commenced and that are worth while. Environmental protection funding even in this year, before it was intended to have the trust take up the funding, should not be held to ransom. I support the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence).

        The government should also close Essendon airport and allow the transference of jet cargo activity to Avalon.

It must move immediately in conjunction with the Victorian government to encourage potential users of the airportâ€”be they aviation manufacturing operations, aircraft maintenance and refurbishing operations, or airfreight operators and distributorsâ€”to stimulate employment growth in the region.

Dynamic decline is usually triggered by the withdrawal of a major employer in a town. As a result, jobs are lost, household incomes fall and the local economy becomes depressed. Local businesses lose revenue and become no longer viable and more jobs are lost.

        The young and those who can afford to leave the town in search of greener pastures do so. Older Australians with no desire to move and those without the necessary finances to move remain. The banks desert their customers who have been loyal to them for years. Governments begin to claim that the critical mass no longer exists in the township to support vital services and they withdraw them.

        This process is repeating itself all over Australia. It is happening in towns in my electorate. One interesting case study is the town of Weston in my electorate.

Visits to the doctor are supposedly up $2, but there was no such decision taken in the budget.

        I understand that 10,000 executive summaries of the document have been distributed and that the first run of the book was 7,000 copies. I believe that the executive summary is something that should most definitely be even more widely disseminated. It should form important discussions even at local community level about the way that we can tackle our environmental problems. One thing is clear: the state of the environment is a question for the national government. But, because of the way in which our federation is put together, it will require not only action by the national parliament and the national government but also the cooperation of the states and territories, local government and, indeed, local communities.

       Superannuation: Mr Ronald Poole

         â€”This evening in the adjournment debate I would like to bring to the attention of the House some concerns of a constituent of mine who has been corresponding with me for quite some time over an issue that concerns him greatly. Mr Ronald Poole of Port Macquarie is a superannuant receiving superannuation payments from Comsuper. His grievance is that his superannuation is called a pension. He indicates to me that he does not agree with this description and takes umbrage at the fact that the Commonwealth calls his superannuation a pension.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Poole retired from the Commonwealth Public Service in 1958 on the grounds of invalidity and thereby became entitled to an invalidity benefit under the provisions of the Superannuation Act 1922. However, Mr Poole has struck a number of obstacles, leaving him unable to have a happy retirement. Mr Poole's complaint stems from an alteration in the Superannuation Act 1976 which provides superannuants with a lump sum to retire on. Mr Poole claims the act of 1976 excludes those under the 1922 act and, therefore, he has had to live on a so&amp;hyphen;called superannuation pension paid fortnightly into his account under the Commonwealth superannuation scheme known as Comsuper.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is this payment to which Mr Poole strongly objects, as he believes the word `pension' is being incorrectly used in place of the word `superannuation'. According to Mr Poole, the term `superannuation pension' used by Comsuper to describe his entitlement is incorrect as the two words have entirely different definitions. Mr Poole refers to
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Webster's Dictionary
        </emphasis>
        , which defines a pension as `an annual allowance of a sum of money to a person by government in consideration of past services' whereas superannuation is defined as being `a sum of money contributed or paid for, granted for life'. Because Mr Poole's entitlement is the subject of a superannuation scheme, any reference to the word `pension' he finds offensive.
       </para>
       <break page="5619" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Poole also refers to a clause permitting suspension of fortnightly super payments which he believes is totally inadequate after his entitlements were suspended on two occasionsâ€”one spanning three years from 1989 to 1992 and the other for a 12&amp;hyphen;month period shortly after. Comsuper claims the payments were suspended after Mr Poole refused to accept his payments after he closed his bank account and did not advise of his preferred method of payment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, Mr Poole is adamant that he should be subject to the changes associated with the 1976 Superannuation Act allowing him to be paid out a lump sum for his retirement. During the time in which Mr Poole's payments were suspended, Mr Poole claims he was denied the going 12.5 per cent interest rate leaving him without approximately $10,000 in interest. Mr Poole also complains of the failure by Comsuper to issue him with a group certificate during that period.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, Mr Poole believes a review should be conducted into the Commonwealth Superannuation Act as he claims the acts of 1922 and 1976, which are part of the current act, discriminate against some superannuants over others. On behalf of Mr Poole, I take this opportunity to thank the House for its indulgence this evening. I have taken the opportunity of conveying Mr Poole's concerns to the relevant minister, but he also wished, as his representative, for me to convey his concerns to this House.

         Bishop Belo returned to East Timor in July 1981 after being ordained to priesthood in Lisbon, Portugal, the year before. He has issued a number of statements and pastoral letters on the situation in East Timor calling for changes in the treatment of the East Timorese population by the Indonesian auth orities. He has also given refuge to youths being hunted for their alleged role in protest demonstrations in favour of democracy and self&amp;hyphen;determination.

        Bishop Belo has been described in the media as a man who can `pack a political punch' and who has a well&amp;hyphen;deserved reputation for courage and stating the truth. Because of the stance, and the risks, he has taken in defending his people, he has come under increasing pressure from the Indonesian authorities. I note from a recent front page report in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian
        </emphasis>
        newspaper that President Suharto would not even offer his congratulations to Bishop Belo when they met in Dili during a presidential visit this week.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Jose Ramos Horta is currently in exile in Australia, working as a lecturer in the law faculty at the University of New South Wales. He was East Timor's Minister for External Relations and Information before the bloody invasion by Indonesian troops in 1975. Mr Ramos Horta heads the national council of East Timorese resistance and is a permanent representative to the United Nations for the East Timorese independence movement. I note that he has stated he wishes he could share the award with the Fretilin leader, Xanana Gusmao, who is currently being detained by the Indonesian forces.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Since the invasion, Jose Ramos Horta has continued to work tirelessly for independence out of Portugal, then the United Nations and now Australia. The awarding of these two Nobel peace prizes is a strong and stirring political symbol of which we in positions of political influence in Australia should take note. It is highly encouraging that such an important international statement has been made on behalf of the people of East Timor and their fight against the Indonesian authorities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        While the public hears little of what is happening in East Timor, we cannot turn a blind eye to the massacres and bloodshed that have occurred to the East Timorese at the hands of the Indonesian authorities since 1975. Mr Ramos Horta has said that Australia must be part of a concerted international effort to persuade Indonesia to withdraw troops from East Timor. It is significant that
        <break page="5620" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the United Nations and, indeed, most countries do not recognise the takeover.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I urge the members of this House to consider the plight of the East Timorese and to assist these two Nobel Peace Prize winners in achieving their dream of independence and the halting of violence against their people. This is an important human rights issue and history will certainly judge our role in its development.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is significant that Australia has a particular responsibility, given the role that Fretilin and the East Timorese had during World War II in protecting Australian troops after the Japanese invasion of Timor. The Timorese suffered many thousands of casualties while defending and protecting Australian troops in Timor. Unfortunately, Australia's record in repaying that debt to the East Timorese leaves much to be desired.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I pass on my congratulations not only to the two individuals but also to the East Timorese people as I believe the Nobel Peace Prize award is not so much a recognition of those two individuals. Whilst that is important, it is also a recognition of the struggle of an entire people, and I think the Nobel recipients would agree. They are an entire people who have much in common with Australia being a Christian nation to the north of us. They have much in common with many Australians and I think this is an important recognition, one which the House should not let pass without some recognition of it. That is the reason for my raising this matter here tonight.

         â€”Last Friday, I visited Perry Matthews and his wife. Perry Matthews and his wife have a young family. Perry, unfortunately, was diagnosed on 21 May 1996 with terminal cancer. He had previously taken out a policy with the AMP in September 1995, but the AMP declined to come good on the policy on the basis that he had not disclosed the fact that he had had a melanoma removed 2&amp;half; years before. That melanoma has no connection whatsoever medically with the lung cancer.

         In the short time available, I have looked at the material in relation to this case. Certainly, there is a potential legal matter pending but, in my opinion, having regard to the statements made by the agent at the time, AMP should reconsider this matter in the light of all the evidence. It should consider the Matthews family as a worthy one to make some sort of ex gratia payment to them having regard to all the circumstances of this particular case, in particular the fact that Mr Matthews and his family are going to be left destitute as a result of the decision of AMP to decline on their policy. In these circumstances, I call on AMP to look at the matter again with a view to assisting this sad family's situation.

        The second of the cognate bills is the Income Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996 and is intended to amend other Commonwealth acts that contain references to the income tax law, to ensure that they reflect the amendments proposed in the Income Tax Assessment Bill. It will also close off the application of provisions of the 1936 act that have been rewritten in the assessment bill.

        These bills were introduced in the House on 19 June 1996 and were referred for consideration by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.

        I would like to refer to nine specific items included in those three cognate bills. First of all, and not in any order of importance, is the tax rebate for low income aged persons. This amendment is to implement an election commitment to provide a rebate to certain persons of pension age who are in the same taxable income range as pensioners who are entitled to the pensioner rebate. The second of the items refers to rebatable annuities, and the losers in this will be the members of the superannuation and insurance industries who are marketing products that take advantage of the loophole that currently exists. This item will close off that loophole.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Some additional points in regard to these amendments are that the measures maintain the current treatment of certain annuities purchased on or before 12 January 1987, and the
        <break page="5623" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         measures apply from the date of the press release announcing the amendment. This approach was necessary as a prior warning of the closing of the loophole, which unfortunately may have resulted in last&amp;hyphen;minute activity to take advantage of the anomaly.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The next item that I wish to raise is the medical expenses rebate which is a very important initiative of the government. The medical expenses rebate replaced the concessional expenditure rebate for medical expenses in the 1985&amp;hyphen;86 income year. Originally, the rebate was calculated at the rate of 30 cents in the dollar on medical expenses in excess of $1,000 in an income year. Between 1985&amp;hyphen;86 and 1991&amp;hyphen;92 the rate of rebate was reduced progressively to 20 cents in the dollar on the excess above the threshold. There will be no additional compliance costs in regard to this measure as taxpayers will not be required to keep additional records and, to qualify for the rebate, taxpayers will have to keep records of medical expenses as they do under the existing law.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The next item is the sale of mining rights. There is no policy justification for providing an incentive for the metals and minerals currently listed and not providing similar incentives for the discovery of others. Equity investment in small and medium enterprisesâ€”small businesses, medium sized businessesâ€”will assist small and medium enterprises to obtain finances and the winners will be the SMEs and the institutions which make such investments to the SMEs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The general outline for cooperative companies is that the measure will repeal paragraph 120(1)(c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to remove the tax deduction that eligible cooperatives have been entitled to, in respect of certain government loans used to purchase assets. The reason for this amendment is to repeal the paragraph, which is consistent with competitive neutrality principles and the government's policy of removing anomalies from the tax system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The next item is the tax exempt entities which will give effect to measures first announced by the previous government on 1 July 1995 to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act and to allocate incoming and outgoing gains and losses to the periods before or after the exemptions to which they belong. The amendments will apply to entities that become taxable on or after 3 July 1995.

        The other two points I wish to raise are housekeeping measures: the infrastructure borrowings and research and development activities. That is all I would like to raise in regard to these bills.

        With regard to this package of bills, it is the first instalment of the rewrite of the income tax law under the tax law improvement project. The project was established in 1994 by the former Labor government to restructure, renumber and rewrite the income tax law in plain English. This was obviously a very important measure; public trust in our laws in Australia relies on the ability of citizens to understand the law. Many Australians, of course, feel that they have not got access to tax accountants, tax lawyers, shelf companies, unit trusts, offshore trusts, family trusts; they have not got the same access in the taxation system as those who hold wealth and high income in this country. As they have trouble comprehending the complexity of the income tax laws, this undermines public trust and confidence in the system.

         Average citizensâ€”average PAYE taxpayersâ€”are not able to get across the huge complexity of these laws, while other citizens have access to those resources that bring them within the ambit of tax minimisation and tax avoidance. I noted with interest, trawling through the declaration of members' interests, that the Liberal party, and certainly the members in this place, have shown far greater attachment to family trusts than family values in their rhetoric and I think this is indicative of the double standards that apply within the Australian taxation system. The average citizen is struggling hard to understand the complexity of these laws, while other citizens have the resources available to them to use the best lawyers and accountants to take advantage of tax minimisation possibilities.

         The Income Tax Assessment Bill proposes to replace major sections of the existing legislation, the Income Tax Amendment Act 1936. Further tranches of replacement provisions will be enacted in the future, probably on an annual basis. The government has some significant further draft legislation which has already been released in the public arena for comment which builds on the set of reforms started by the former Labor government. Exposure drafts 7 and 8 have been released which cover important areas such as depreciation and capital allowances for primary producers. In due course, the opposition looks forward to these measures and rewrites flowing through into firm legislative proposals.

          In conclusion on these matters, the opposition supports these bills because they will improve the legislation that business and the rest of the community have to deal with, hopefully leading to a better business environment with lower compliance costs. It is also worth remembering that these bills are the result of the tax law improvement process that was initiated and undertaken during our time in office. In essence, this is a Labor initiative that we trust the government will carry well into the future. We also trust that it will not find any handicaps or mishaps under the administration of the Treasurer, Mr Costello.

Jim Short, Assistant Treasurer, is goneâ€”Costello curse. Mr Gibson, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurerâ€”gone the same way. The Premiers Conferenceâ€”spoiled; we moved from cooperative federalism in Australia to destructive federalism through the Treasurer's actions. Of course, the incident with Mr Greenspan has ricocheted around the financial markets of the globe. The government's relationship with Senator Harradine has been sullied by the Treasurer's imprudent remarks in the House not so long ago and, of course, the Development Allowance Authority and the tollway concessions have been the subject of an enormous backflip by the Treasurer. This is a litany of maladministration within the Treasurer's portfolio.

He is not so cursed as his boss, the Treasurer, and I look forward to a successful program being brought to its conclusion.

         â€”I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate about these three bills that we are in the process of dealing with cognately, but most of my comments will be restricted to the exercise which has been undertaken in relation to the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996. As the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) indicated, and others have indicated in connection with this question, it arose initially from an exercise which was undertaken by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in the previous parliament, when a recommendation was made by that committee that the opportunity be taken to rewrite and to simplify the existing tax act.

        That proposal was accepted by the government and then the exercise was undertaken by the tax law improvement project. I acknowledge the presence in the advisers' box of Mr Brian Nolan, who was the convenor, coordinator and leader of that particular improvement project. I want to acknowledge and place on the record again my appreciation, and that of the
        <break page="5626" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         committee and of the parliament, for the efforts of Mr Nolan and those other people who are here today who also participated in one way or another in that exercise. It was to my mind, and to the minds of the committee members, a very valuable exercise. We would hope that the purposes for which that exercise was undertaken will be achieved when the bill, when it becomes an act, becomes operative and becomes available to all of those people who are involved with it in one way or another.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Naturally, I harbour reservations about the extent to which the ordinary taxpayer will refer to it. Ordinary taxpayers did not refer to the previous act, nor will they refer to this act. Nor will many of the advisers refer to this act, as they dependedâ€”quite understandablyâ€”upon the handouts from the taxation department previously. But the thing about it is that there is no doubt that ordinary taxpayers will, if they wish to go to the act, better understand its provisions, and be better able, hopefully, to more correctly relate their activities and the conduct of their affairs to it. And it is to be hoped that those tax advisersâ€”people in the professional tax industryâ€”will refer more frequently to it because it is more understandable.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The exercise was undertaken because the original tax act, which this one now replaces, is the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, so it has been 60 years since any exercise of this kind has been undertaken. During those 60 years, as one might expect in an increasingly complex economy with increasingly sophisticated arrangements on the part of business and on the part of taxpayers arranging their affairs, governments, responding to those changing circumstances and seeking to clarify some aspects of the tax law or seeking to close loopholes which develop in the tax law, have introduced changes from time to time. That has been going on for 60 years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When the previous government was elected in 1983, the Income Tax Assessment Act was 1,100 pages long. I remember being critical of the government that we replaced in 1983 because of that. I can understand why people like the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) is now being critical of the previous Labor government, because that 1,100 pages has grown to 3,300 pages over that 13&amp;hyphen;year period. If we also include the legislative provisions which have became part of the Income Tax Assessment Act, it is closer to 5,000, and maybe even over 5,000 pages.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So it was necessary for this exercise to be undertaken. For those people who want a simple and easy reference to the way in which some of these apparent complexities have been overcome and the way in which the act has been simplified, there are any number of examples at the end of the explanatory memorandum. Let me place one of them on the record.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For the provisions of the act in relation to division 43, for example, the new law is contained within division 43&amp;hyphen;10.

         It restates the provisions of the existing act, the previous law, which were contained within the following parts: 124ZC(1)(a) and (b), 124ZC(2)(a) and (b), 124ZC(2A)(a) and (b), 124ZC(3)(a) and (b), 124ZC(4)(a) and (b), 124ZC(4A)(a) and (b), 124ZH(1)(a) and (b), 124ZH(2)(a) and (b), and 124ZH(2A)(a) and (b).

       <para first-indent="16">
        I said to the previous Assistant Treasurer, George Gear, that if the exercise being undertaken to simplify the tax act was to make it more attractive for me to read before I went to sleep, then perhaps this one might serve the purpose. Certainly, Mr Deputy Speaker, neither you nor I went to sleep pondering that ponderous previous Income Tax Assessment Act. So it has been a very useful exercise. The work that was undertaken by the tax law improvement project team, together with the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, was very valuable.

       <break page="5627" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The exercise was designed to a large extent to reduce the problems of compliance and the costs associated with it. That is very difficult to estimate. The estimates vary from between $3 billion and $6 billion every year. We can do more with funds of that kind than having them going into the professional tax industry in order to clarify, interpret and apply the tax law.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Hopefully, this particular exercise will overcome that and those $3 billion to $6 billion every year will be applied to other more productive and useful purposes, including my constituents, many of whom could do with that sort of funding to replace a lot of the programs that are disappearing at the present time. There has been a need to overcome the complexity, ambiguity, uncertainty and, in some places, the apparent self&amp;hyphen;contradictions that existed within the old act. We all hope that this present exercise will achieve that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was called the tax law improvement project. I do not want to make too much of that, but there is a suggestion in that title that the tax law was to be improved. That was not the purpose of the exercise. Neither Mr Nolan nor those people who worked with and for him in connection with it believed that that was the case. The exercise was designed to improve the way in which the tax law is statedâ€”not to improve the law but to improve the way in which it is stated. That has been the result of it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to make this observation: the problems of cost of compliance will not be overcome in any tax system, including Australia'sâ€”however we might rewrite the tax lawâ€”until the inherent underlying complexity of the tax system itself is overcome. This does not do it. Nor was it designed toâ€”I am not suggesting that that was a deficiency in the work that was undertaken or of the rewritten tax act which is now made available to us; that was not the purpose of that exercise. But we do need to address it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know that one of the really big, contentious issues in this area was one which developed prior to and in connection with the federal election in 1993, and that was the question of a goods and services tax. It was believed that that would simplify the system. Yes, it would. So people might be entitled to say, `Well, Bob Brown, why don't you support it? You want the system simplified.' I will tell you why I would not support itâ€”and this is relevant to this whole question.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would not support it because, to my mind, the goods and services tax, in shifting the emphasis of tax from income tax to when people spend, would necessarily fall more heavily on those people who spend most of their income. And who are they? They are my constituents. What about those people who do not spend most of their income, those people whose income is such that they are able to accumulate wealth and hold their savings, their investments, their portfolios, in various types of security arrangements? There was no provision for an additional tax there. That is the main reason I opposed it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have always been of the opinion, and continue to be of the opinion, that one of the great difficulties inherent in that tax act and one of the basic underlying reasons for the complexity of it is the fact that we tax income. And in order to tax income you have to define income, you have to say what income isâ€”and that is the problem. What is income? What things do we include in income? We used not to include capital gains. We used not to include fringe benefits. So any person who was able to arrange their affairs in such a way that the accumulation of their wealth came in non&amp;hyphen;monetary forms avoided tax. That was quite apart from the sharks who evaded it and those people who deliberately manipulated the tax act to avoid it. Quite apart from them, there were people who were legitimately able to minimise
         <break page="5628" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the tax they paidâ€”and that is a legitimate practice and a sensible and necessary oneâ€”by arranging their affairs in appropriate ways.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So there is the whole question of identifying income. But we can overcome that to a large extent by saying, `It does not matter where the income comes from, it does not matter what form it comes in. Apart from giving it away or burning it you can only do one of two things: you either spend it or you hold it.' And that can be identified. With a very sophisticated market arrangement you can tax when they spend. That is the GST, but let me add something: you tax what they hold as well. So you do not just tax my constituents who spend most of their income, you catch those people on the North Shore as well, the people who are able to put most of their income aside.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If we do thatâ€”if we tax what people spend and tax what people holdâ€”I will endorse it. You do not then have to define what income is because it does not matter. That is my position, and I will continue to oppose indirect taxes being imposed on expenditure until we hit the wealth that people are accumulating at the same time. When we choose to tax both of those I will support it. That will remove the fundamental underlying complexity, ambiguity and uncertainty, and the self&amp;hyphen;contradictory elements, of the Income Tax Assessment Act, however we might choose to restate it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In relation to this exercise, let me refer to and put on the record some of the particular problems that the public accounts committee had to face in this exercise that it undertook. Firstly, after the matter was referred to it, the committee had to come to some decision about whether the project should proceed. Of course, the committee agreed that it should, and that was one of the recommendations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, as all of the tax law was being rewritten and restated, the committee had to decide whether it should be introduced progressively, or held until it was completed and then introduced into the community all at once. We came down on the side of the first option because it is much better for it to be absorbed gradually, or intruded into the system, so that people become increasingly aware of it. This is one of the first stages in that process: the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 is being restated and completed, and now we feed that into the system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The third question that we had to determine was whether the rewriting exercise should include restatements of the law and changes to it. We said, `No. That is not the purpose of the exercise.' We suggested that any changes should keep faith with the community so that they could not say,`This is just a swiftie. You say that you are just rewriting the law, but you are changing the law.' We said that, to keep faith with the community, if we changed the law we would identify those changes in the explanatory memorandum, and there they are. So people who want to see how the law has been changedâ€”and the changes are fairly minimal, but necessaryâ€”in connection with this exercise, can identify them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There was also the question as to whether, after this exercise, a comprehensive forum to continue to review taxation policy would be maintained. I think that the committee, generally, came down on the side of acceptingâ€”as I accept absolutelyâ€”the responsibility, the right and prerogative of governments to determine taxation policy. Certainly, you take advice, but you do not give that responsibility to others.

          There was also the question of whether a parliamentary committee should give consideration to emerging tax policy. We did not pursue that question too far. I understand that that is a matter which has still to be resolved by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.

          The sixth question was the one that I referred to before: for whom is a tax act written? People will say that it is written for taxpayers. Of course it is not, and never has been. It is written for the tax professionals and the courts. Most income earning taxpaying citizens would never refer to the tax act itself. Although, as I say, with the restated, rewritten, simplified version, more of them may be encouraged to do so. So we accept, of course, that it is not necessarily written for taxpayers. But we accept, as wellâ€”as did Mr Nolan and his teamâ€”that one of the purposes of this was to simplify the act to ensure that people with a reasonable level of education and understanding who wanted to refer to it would be able to understand what it said.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Anyone who has referred to the old tax actâ€”even the professionalsâ€”did not understand what that said in many cases. The degree of litigation and the costs of compliance that I have referred to indicate some of the great difficulties associated with it. There was also a problem of whether some of the rulings and determinations of the tax department in responding to particular tax questions and issues and problems should have been incorporated. We generally came down on the side of believing that that should not happen. There were some cases where it did, and I have no particular argument or concern about that at all.

          I want to take this opportunity, also, to endorse a proposition by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts that it review the unworkable and complex sections of tax law. I am not a member in this parliament of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts so I appreciated enormously the privilege of being associated with this exercise during the previous parliament. In conclusion, I would prefer the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to undertake an examination of the possible general tax framework which may be available to us. I refer to the point that I was making before: it is a question of whether we seek to identify income in order to tax it or whether we adopt a different approach.

         <para first-indent="16">
          If the Joint Committee of Public Accounts were to undertake that exercise, what various systems of taxation would be available to us? To highlight what the advantages and disadvantages of that may be, there might be some genuine consensus that would arise from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is one of those committees of the parliament, all of which, to my mind, seek to pursue a bipartisan approach to these questions. This is one area where, if we do not get a bipartisan approach, we will continue to have conflict on a partisan basis. The difficulty associated with that is that it will tend to lock into the system all of those problems, complexities, ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions which have been in the system from day one and which no amount of rewriting of the tax act will necessarily be able to overcome.

We are here to consider three particular billsâ€”the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996, the Income Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996 and the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Bill 1996â€”which essentially are part of the commencement, in a legislative sense, of the process of moving to restructure and rewrite the taxation law of this country, particularly the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1936.

        As I mentioned, there are three acts: the assessment bill, which actually proposes to replace major sections of the existing legislation; the consequential amendment bills, which will amend other pieces of Commonwealth legislation that contain references to the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1936, to ensure consistency; and the transitional provisions bill, which will explain how the assessment bill will commence to apply. The legislation as it stands is based predominantly on legislation which came through under the previous government. The tax law improvement project is an initiative of the government that I was proud to be a member of in the last parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Certainly, though, the fact that we are here today in a situation where there is bipartisan support for these bills shows that there is an understanding across the parliamentary and political scene in this country that there was a need for major changes. The previous speaker, my friend the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), has gone into some of the examples of just how ridiculous the existing legislation is. Vast changes need to occur, and with some haste.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As has also been mentioned, the Joint Committee on Public Accounts considered this matter in the previous parliament and then again at the commencement of this parliament. The committee came down with a report recently, after quite a number of public hearings and taking submissions on the issues of the legislation and what it is proposing. It is fair to say that there was a range of concerns from practitioners in the field about aspects of the legislation. Certainly, we endeavoured to traverse a number of technical issues which came up on those occasions, and I think that a reasonable job was done.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Beyond that, the biggest issue which came upâ€”and which I am pleased to see that the government has taken into accountâ€”is the issue of retrospectivity. There was widespread concern through that consultation process that this legislation ought not be retrospective. There were arguments on both sides. I have some sympathy with both. The argument that was put by those favouring the date as it was proposed in the original draft legislation, which would have been 1 July 1996, was certainly more about creating a shock. The one thing I would like to stress today is the fact that the accounting and taxation industry has to grapple with this legislation now, not in 12 months time. They have to get to the guts of it right now, because the situation is that although this is a simplification bill there are, in effect, major changes to the operation of taxation law.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact is that there are accounting practitioners who have no idea what is really in this legislationâ€”and that was explained to us through the consultation process of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I accept the argument that they should and I accept the argument that they have to. But the fact was, and is, that they do not really understand the detail of what is coming through, and they have to come to grips with it quickly. There is a set date in this legislationâ€”the middle of next year. That signals very clearly that it will be coming into effect in the very near future and people had better come to grips with it or they are going to have real difficulties in the transitional process. The rest of these bills largely is technical amendments, most of them taking into account the question of the change of dates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are a couple of issues I would like to touch on briefly which were also part of the considerations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. They were not necessarily taken
        <break page="5631" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         up in this legislation but relate to it very significantly. For example, there is the question of a revenue committee. The previous speaker, the member for Charlton, mentioned that the JCPA had not addressed that issue. I think it is fair to say that it has, to a greater extent, in its final report.

       <para>
        If I could paraphrase one of the major concerns expressed through the consultation process from a range of industry representatives it was that, as the legislation comes into operation and as difficulties are discoveredâ€”as they will be, as has been conceded by all sidesâ€”how quickly would those sorts of issues be addressed. The point was made that if, for example, it was something that cost the government revenue, the odds were that action would be swift and brutal; if the situation was the reverse of that, in the fullness of time it might require a full consideration of the issues ad nauseam.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The hope isâ€”and it is certainly the hope of the committeeâ€”that those matters can be addressed quickly, effectively and efficiently to meet the concerns of the industry. I think that is also the wish of people in the TLIP. But from what I have seen of this place in the years I have been here, I think there need to be some very formal processes to address those matters, otherwise things may not get addressed. On the question of options, the committee put down three variations on the theme that the government could pick up and I think there is plenty of room there for the government to decide on what they see as the best option. I have my own preference, but I would say that any of the options mentioned certainly give a firm basis for pursuing the matter in the future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another issue of concern related to the question on technical errors. Recommendation 9 of the report says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Technical errors in the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 should be corrected as a matter of priority. The corrections should either be incorporated in future instalments of the legislation to replace the

         Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
        </emphasis>
        or be dealt with as part of the technical corrections process recently put in place by the Australian Taxation Office, whichever process is quicker. Furthermore, technical amendments legislation should become the regular vehicle for making technical corrections to tax law.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, the arguments I have put regarding the previous issue of a revenue committee of some sort are relevant here: action is needed on changes as they are discovered and variations that need to be done must be acted upon quickly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another issue which came up was the question of rulings. The nature of the taxation system as it stands is that so much of the detail is in the actual legislation, but so much more detail in many respects is actually contained in rulings done by the Commissioner of Taxation. Recommendation 2 of the report says:
       </para>
       <break page="5632" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Commissioner of Taxation and the major tax bodies (through the National Tax Liaison Group) should agree, as a matter of urgency, to a process and timetable for rewriting existing Public Rulings affected by the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 and subsequent legislation. The process and priority to be given to rewriting individual Rulings should be determined by the end of 1996 and be made publicly available. The public statement should also include a completion date for the process of rewriting the Rulings.
        </para>
        <para>
        </para>
        <para>
         I understand that there may have been some developments with respect to this. I have not seen any details. What I would say is that that is of particular urgency.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another issue that was raised with us through this process is the question of legislation and rulings. Essentially, if both are not fixed, then in many respects, nothing is fixed. Therefore, that action is also crucial and further advancements need to be made on that basis.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another issue that I will mention is the question of the actual savings associated with this legislation. An argument that was put to us was that there were significant savings to be made through the process of this legislation. However, when debate occurred, there was some difficulty in terms of quantifying the actual real value of these changes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not pretend to be a taxation expert in any way, shape or form, but when you see something go from one size down to another size, you tend to thinkâ€”at least in a visual senseâ€”that there is an improvement. From looking at some of the detail thereâ€”for example, looking at some of the points that were made by the member for Charltonâ€”one tends to think there will be substantial savings over time in terms of the time taken to actually apply the legislation. Certainly, it is agreed that, in the short term, in the first couple of years while practitioners are becoming accustomed to the new system, and as the system is being progressively introduced, there will be difficulties and additional costs. I think that everyone accepts that that is necessary in order to get a better long&amp;hyphen;term system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, one recommendation which the JCPA put forward was that the Australian Taxation Office should undertake or assist with further research attempting to quantify the costs of tax compliance in Australia. Again, I am no expert, but I suspect that the costs are absolutely phenomenal. There is some figure work available on those issues, but certainly the question of what these changes will do, in terms of reducing and minimising that cost, is uncertain at best. I suspect that when that work is done, we will find that it is quite significant. But I urge for that work to be done because the one thing that we certainly need to try to ensure with legislation going through this place is an element of accountability. And that accountability relates not only to the question of conflicts of interest, nor to practical applications and outcomes, but it is also a question of dollars and of real effect. If we cannot quantify what the real effect of a change is, then we have got to really question just how much value there is in that change. On this occasion, I think that there is value. I certainly support the legislation and wish it a speedy passage through both houses of the parliament. But I think we also ought to be able, for our own sake, and for the ATO's sake, to actually say, `This is what it is worth.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I mentioned earlier, this legislation and the whole process through the taxation law improvement project is, as the member of Charlton said, not a question of actual improvement, but of simplification. That simplification is an improvement in terms of the way the law will be applied. I will not go into a number of arguments about the question of what taxation law we should actually have, although I would concur in many respects with the previous speaker about the nature of the sort of taxation system we should have. But I would also say that taxation law debate is similar, in many respects, to discussions that I have had on religion. It is very easy to have very long and involved arguments and it is often confusing. In the end
         <break page="5633" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          it seems to come down sometimes to articles of faith. I reserve the right to have my own articles of faith, as I am sure others do. I wish the legislation a speedy passage. I congratulate those involved in getting it together. I wish them all the very best in the future in terms of dealing with the rest of this process. I do not envy them. I do not wish to join them, but I have a feeling that if I am still in the JCPA, I am going to have a look at what they have done. I commend the legislation to the House for a speedy passage.

         â€”Of the three bills which are being debated cognately, the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 contains by far the most important measures, the others containing, as their titles suggest, transitional provisions and consequential amendments. All three bills were introduced into the House by Mr Miles, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister on 19 June. Subsequently, the government took the unusually wise step of referring the legislation to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and I have already recorded my compliments to its chairman, members and staff for the work they did.

        The tax law improvement project was first announced by the former Labor government in December 1993, with the object of rewriting the income tax laws in simple language. The project actually got started on 1 July 1994 and wasâ€”and, I understand, still isâ€”expected to be completed after three years, by the end of financial year 1997. The project has a consultative committee of 14 members made up of representatives of accounting and legal firms, the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Corporate Tax Association, the National Farmers Federation and the Taxation Institute of Australia. There are also a couple of representatives from other private sector sources.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The announcement of the project followed a recommendation made in November 1993 by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts along the lines that the then government should establish a broadly based task force to redraft the principal income tax act. The project team has also released a broad framework. It makes clear that it is not about reforming the tax system or rewriting tax policy. The focus is on administrative rules that are overly complex, unnecessary or out of date in today's realities. However, the framework also made it clear that, when redrafting, the project team may come across provisions where the meaning is unclear. Those cases, it was anticipated, might require the government to clarify the policy so that the law itself can be more clearly written.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The objectives of the then governmentâ€”and, as far as I know, of the present governmentâ€”include shorter, clearer, simpler and more readable text than we find in present law. This is to be achieved by restructuring, renumbering and rewriting the legislation, as has already been indicated by previous speakers. One aim is to reduce compliance costs by rewriting the principal act and other tax laws, to render them easier to understand. These objectives cannot be met until early in the next century, we are told, although I hope that there will be some improvement on that timetable.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The major shortcoming with this whole exercise has been the narrowness of the review. Complex tax policy issues which need to be addressed to achieve major simplification of the tax system have been totally ignoredâ€”in this bill, anywayâ€”with the emphasis of this project resting 100 per cent on using plain English and adopting a simple legislative structure. This is to be commended but, as I have to go on and outline, it goes nowhere near far enough. The rewriting of the income tax laws will be completed over an extended time, so there are more bills to follow these and the rewritten substantiation rules, which have already been passed
        <break page="5634" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        As I have stated in this place on many occasions, there is no doubt whatsoever that the tax system needs simplifying. Compliance costs have become exorbitant. They are at the top end of the scale in the Western world. This is attributable both to policies which underlie our tax laws and, in many cases, to the attitude of the Australian Taxation Office.

         It is hard to believe that what we have so far seen and heard is indicative of a government which is content only to tinker around the edges. Ms Lucinda Schmidt goes on to say that some tax advisers:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . fear the TLIP will plod on and waste taxpayers' money tinkering around with wording, while fundamental changes are being drafted by other bodies.
        </para>
        <para>
         I doubt that we will see any radical change, but that is exactly what we require. Radical change is essential if the tax system is to be simplified and the cost of compliance is to be reduced significantly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It might be useful at this stage to go over the origins of this. The project was established by the Keating government on 1 July 1994, following consistent ongoing criticism from legal and accounting bodies of delays in simplification of tax legislation. It appears that the then government's decision to establish the project was also driven by a belief that the rewrite of our complex tax legislation would result in a significant reduction in compliance costs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This would have been welcome news to the proprietors of as many as 929,339 Australian small businesses, which have been weighed down by the burgeoning cost of tax compliance. Some 26 months later, I pose a rhetorical question to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or perhaps to the parliamentary secretary at the table: what improvements have been enjoyed by the private sector as a result of the recommendations of the project team? The answer is none.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Admittedly, the project team still has another 10 months to continue its deliberations, but the fact is that there are fundamental flaws in its charter which leave little room for optimism in the small business community. The project team has yet to publish its statement of criteria for determination of what is an acceptable level of complexity in the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is a given that some degree of complication goes hand in hand with income tax. However, how can this team work towards simplifying income tax legislation if no valid or worthwhile attempt has been made to identify how complex it must be in the first place?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the benefits of tax simplification done well will be certainty. As tax law becomes more confusing, the small business proprietors in this country are more likely to employ the services of tax professionals to advise them of their obligations. However, this advice, as we all know, comes at great expense to those proprietors at a time when they are still recovering from unnecessary cashflow problems caused by the former Labor government's taxing and regulatory regimes. Therefore, it is unlikely that small business owners will favour activities where the profit outcome is more predictable. Economic neutrality is being jeopardised by tax complexity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another shortcoming of the project team's agenda is its failure to identify who the targeted readership of the simplified legislation is. The ordinary taxpayerâ€”which includes the proprietor of a small businessâ€”was identified initially as being the reader in the team's first two
         <break page="5636" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          information papers. Hence, we would have expected that the new legislation would be written in the language of the layman. Such a non-elitist approach would actually mean more people would understand their tax rights and obligations. Wouldn't that be a change!

         They would also be able to work out more easily what tax they are required to pay, saving time and money for reinvestment and for productive effort. These savings, coupled with those gained from a reduction in the uplift factor, might then enable the small business community in Australia to employ more productive staff. However, by late 1994 the project team had decided it was more practical to focus on tax professionals than on individuals, resulting in a very different rewrite of the tax legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This poses the question, Mr Deputy Speaker: what is the point of replacing existing legislation which is targeted towards professional readership with new legislation also aimed at tax professionals. If the present Howard government is truly committed to reducing the costs to small businesses in complying with tax laws and business regulations, what does it plan to do to modify and implement the tax law simplification project? I submit that the determination of the readership of the new laws and the definition of complexity of tax compliance need to be addressed immediately.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The coalition knows that the primary goals of tax simplification should be to make the law easier to understand, reduce the cost of compliance and bring logic and rationality to the tax system. Labor totally failed to understand this, though I still believe the coalition, in its second term, might get around to making some radical changes, but we will have to wait and see.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The coalition, nevertheless, must be prepared to examine tax policy issues which need to be rectified if the system is to be simplified. Policy is at the heart of much of the complexity, and all the simplification effort in the world will not eradicate complexity unless policy is tackled. A good start in this direction would be to allow the TLIP to expand into policy areas. A recent report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts urged the government to comprehensively review tax policy, focusing not only on tax legislation, but also on the administrative systems underpinning it. The committee ended its report to the parliament by noting that:

         (Braddonâ€”Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (11.08 a.m.)â€”Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I rise to continue some discussion on this bill and to point out a few things concerning comments made by speakers in the Main Committee this morning.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The first thing to say about this is that certainly modern business activity is complex and it would be raising unrealistic expectations to the point of naivety to hope for our tax laws to become truly simple. The task which has been undertaken here is an important task; it has been going on now for a considerable time. The taxation system has to meet the fundamental objective of raising revenue for the nation against the background of the very sophisticated commercial and social environment in Australia, as well as our competitive situation in the rest of the world.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The desire for simplicity also has to be assessed against the other important tax design principles of equity and efficiency. Often these things compete with each other and
         <break page="5637" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          compromises have to be made. But the government believes that the taxation system carries too high a compliance cost for the business community. I know that the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) is indicating that nothing of practical benefit has come out of the work to dateâ€”I think I am summarising him reasonably accurately. I think that there does have to be some credit given to the fact that, in this rewrite, the simplification of language is important and, as time goes on, I think that that will bring benefits overall. In that regard, it is interesting to note what the Joint Committee of Public Accounts had to sayâ€”and I just want to mention two or three of its quotes in this regard:
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

         Benefits will come from having a simpler structure and language which is simpler to read. Hopefully, as time goes on, this will benefit business people in the community. So I disagree to a certain extent with the statement of the member for Curtin that no benefits will come from this. I believe they will.

         The complexity of the Income Tax Assessment Act undoubtedly contributes greatly to the costs of business. If we can reduce excessive compliance costs in the tax system, we will reduce the cost of doing business, which will lead to higher productivity and increased competitiveness and will have positive impacts on economic growth and employment. This is why this bill is an important element in simplifying the tax laws and increasing certainty and confidence in the tax system.

         A major focus of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in considering the bill in its report No. 345 was how policy review should be handled. Critics have said that the rewrite project is too narrowly focused and that opportunities for important tax law reform are not being taken. The JCPA understood that combining tax policy review with such a vast task as rewriting the whole of the Income Tax Assessment Act would have led to the project getting bogged down and not being completed within an acceptable time frame.

This project is about that, and certainly some of the language which I have read makes it much easier already for me to understand the tax law.

         The new structure has met with broad approval, as have many user&amp;hyphen;friendly features incorporated to assist readers, especially tax practitioners, on whose advice business relies in tax matters. There has been strong approval of the structural design and the new numbering system. Many quite innovative design features have been included to improve communication of the law. These are already having an impact on wider Commonwealth legislative drafting practice and are something of a trailblazer for improvement of Commonwealth law generally. The bill makes a substantial number of minor rule changes, which remove unnecessary compliance barriers, and provide simplifications designed to bring the law into closer alignment with administrative and commercial practices.

The government believes these processes of consultation and review allow differences to be aired openly and frankly, contributing markedly to the end product.

         At this point, I would like to indicate also that we will be moving a number of amendments on behalf of the government in due course, and at this stage I would just like to go through some details in that regard. For the convenience of members, the amendments have been
         <break page="5639" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          brought together in three packages. The first package will defer the commencement date of the bills. The second package will introduce streamlined arrangements for identifying who owns the shares of certain companies. The third package will make a number of miscellaneous minor changes to the bills.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the first package, the amendments will defer the date of commencement of the bills by 12 months, to 1 July 1997. This means that the bills will start to apply in the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 income year. This later date will allow more time for a smooth transition to the new law. The Assistant Treasurer announced this measure in his response to the report by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on bills, which was tabled in the House on 22 August. The amendments broadly accord with the recommendations of the joint committee, which proposed a starting date from the income year following royal assent. However, the community needs to be able to plan on the basis of a definite starting date. Of course, if the bills are enacted prior to 1 July 1997, the starting date will give effect exactly to the committee's recommendations.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Amendments T1 to T30 of the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 are those tracing the ownership of listed public companies. These amendments will provide, in the rewritten losses provisions, streamlined rules for listed public companies to establish who owns their shares. The amendments were announced by the Assistant Treasurer in his response to the joint committee's report. The new rules are a major compliance cost breakthrough; they will provide more certainty and a far simpler method for establishing share ownership. Companies need to maintain continuity of ownership to deduct tax losses. For listed public companies, tracing through nominee companies and interposed entities to identify very large numbers of individual beneficial owners can impose a significant evidentiary burden.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The new rules build on administrative arrangements put in place by the Commissioner of Taxation. There are two features to the new rules. Firstly, companies will no longer be required to trace ownership on an ongoing basis. Instead, companies will only be required to trace ownership if there has been abnormal trading in its shares. There will be one exception, the case of prior year losses, where the ownership must also be traced at the end of each year until the loss is recouped. This is a significant concession. The existing rules require testing at all times during the year of the loss and the year the loss is recouped.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, small shareholdings of less than one per cent will be aggregated, and a national shareholder will be taken to own that pool of shares. Using established rules in the Corporations Law, large, indirect shareholdings held in small parcels of shares will be excluded from the pool. As well, safeguards will ensure that the rules do not operate to defeat the purpose of the continuity of the beneficial ownership test. Additionally, shares held by complying approved deposit funds, complying superannuation funds, mutual life companies and certain other companies with similar characteristics will be taken to be the beneficial owner of those shares. This will relieve the obligation to trace beneficial ownership of those shares.

         As with all the amendments being moved by the government, these improvements to the law will apply from the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 income year. These are miscellaneous changes.

These changes do not involve any change in policy and are mainly designed to correct drafting errors and omissions and to ensure that the new law accurately rewrites the existing law.

          â€”The seminar on the Australian aid program was an important and timely seminar. I feel that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade should conduct more such seminars. In this regard I am pleased to note that a seminar, reviewing a report that that committee brought down on our relationship with PNG, is planned for early November.

         Few issues in the community generate as much discussion as aid, and I suspect that few issues are as misunderstood or misreported as the whole aid question. Regardless of the misinformation peddled throughout the community, few, I suggest, could argue with the fact that the gap between the rich and the poor in so many countries is continuing to grow. Australia has always had a good record regarding the question of aid and I hope that it will
         <break page="5673" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          continue. Despite our living in a technologically advanced age, there is a persistence of poverty throughout the world.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As was said during the seminar by a representative of AusAid, describing the development needs of the world, approximately 800 million to 1.3 billion live in absolute poverty in the world today. About one billion people do not have access to basic health services, 1.3 billion do not have access to safe water and two billion do not have access to sanitation services. Approximately 30 per cent of land in Africa is affected by significant degradation, as is about 20 per cent of land in Asia. There are about 54 million refugees and displaced persons in the world today. To add to that list of needs, the vice&amp;hyphen;president of the World Bank indicated that the unmet infrastructure needs in East Asia alone require $1.9 trillion in investment over the decade.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Poverty is not only persistent, but in the post&amp;hyphen;Cold War world, it is a growing phenomenon giving greater polarisation between the rich and poor. A sobering statistic is that 89 countries are worse off today than they were 10 years ago, and 1.6 billion people are worse off than they were 15 years ago. Infant mortality is rising. Twenty&amp;hyphen;one per cent of the world's population saw their share of global income decline from 2.3 to 1.4 per cent over the last 30 years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Perhaps the most dramatic statistic presented at the seminar was that the assets of the world's 358 billionaires exceed the combined annual incomes of countries with 45 per cent of the world's population. That is something that we should consider, and I am particularly pleased that you are in the chair, Mr Deputy Speakerâ€”not only because I should be there and you were kind enough to relieve meâ€”as I know that you would have a particular interest in that statistic with your interest in poverty reduction throughout the world. The income of the 358 billionaires of the world exceeds the combined annual income of countries with 45 per cent of the world's population.

        <para first-indent="16">
         To hear many members of the general public talk about aid, and indeed some members in this place, one would think that Australia was one of those 89 countries that are worse off today than they were 10 years ago. Like many members, I hear ill&amp;hyphen;informed comments that Australia is heading for Third World status. When people come up to me or write letters to my electorate and say that Australia is heading for Third World status, my usual response to them is to ask when they were last in a Third World country. Regardless of what problems we might have in this country, and I sometimes think, I must say, that the problems in this country are never as great as many imagine, these problems pale into insignificance with the problems of Third World countries. I suggest that most Third World countries would readily exchange their problems for ours. As such, we have a responsibility and a duty to continue aidâ€”a moral as well as a practical responsibility.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Having said that, when large amounts of aid are given, I believe it is our right to ensure that it goes for the purpose granted. That is, I have been in favour of giving to some of the international organisations untied aid, but I think that when we give aid on a one&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;one basis with a country, we have a right to say where it should go. I remember some years ago I was a member of the committee that brought down the report on our relationship with PNG. Having visited that country with the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and other people, I was very strongly for the recommendations in that report that the bulk of our aid to PNG should go from untied to tied. I think that there was no dissent on that committee. Everyone who was on that committee and who brought down that report felt that that should
         <break page="5674" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          be. I know that since that time there has been some discussion with officials from PNG earlier this year about whether the aid that we give to PNG should go back to being untied. Considering the amount of aidâ€”and PNG receives the largest amount of Australian aidâ€”I think we have struck the right balance of it being tied. It should go into specific projects that not only we have an interest in, but also the PNG people have an interest in.

         The government has cut $3.5 million in the foreign aid budget for family planning. Given the population problems of the world, so well documented, and given the fact that over recent years there have been international conferences dealing with the population issueâ€”especially the Cairo Population Conference, and indeed later this year there will be the Rome Food Conferenceâ€”how can this government justify a cut of $3.5 million in the foreign aid budget for family planning and hold its head up in international forums throughout the world?

         The government has slashed funding by $2 million to the United Nations Population Fund, the one coordinating body in the world taking the global approach to this problem.

         In the report on the conference the document says that it was largely a summary of the day's discussion. It did not seek to come to definite conclusions although the committee did include a number of recommendations largely related to a possible linkage which the committee believed would be a useful starting point for more productive planning and development assistance, and for the debate on the appropriate priorities in the direction of Australia aid. And I would urge all members, especially those who have an interest in the aid question, to read that report.

          Seminars such as this are important not only to highlight issues of aid but also to assist members of parliament to better understand the complexities of the aid issues. There is a responsibility for members of parliament to take a lead on this issue. That is why it is particularly disappointing to see the views of one member, the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), getting such coverage. In an interesting article in the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Sydney Morning Herald
          </emphasis>
          on 12 October, Mike Seccombe posed a number of questions. I will just comment on two which are related to this report. What if the government followed the advice of the honourable member for Oxley and withdrew from the United Nations? In this article he said:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          this would place Australia in the company of a handful of tiny and pariah states. International affairs experts say this would badly hurt trade, and probably lead to boycotts of Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Then, of course, we come to the other call by the honourable member for Oxley to cut foreign aid. What if we cut foreign aid? Mike Seccombe continues:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          this would also be likely to harm international relations, particularly in the region, but could also hurt the domestic economy. Increasingly, Australian aid is not sent as money, but in goods and services sourced from local companies. The theory is that aid often greases the wheels of trade, although this is difficult to quantify.
         </para>
         <para>
          So, I must say that I do not share the views of the honourable member for Oxley. In fact, I have not found anyone in this place who actually does. It is a great pity that, on such a sensitive issue as aid, her views are getting such wide publicity. I think that they are sending the wrong image out to the Australian people and, indeed, to our neighbours that many members of this House share that view. I have spoken to many members of this House and I have not yet found one who shares the views of the honourable member for Oxley. It would have, perhaps, helped her education and understanding of some of the aid issues on which she is commenting, if she had attended this seminar or, indeed, had read this report.

          Again, I would like to commend the committee, especially the Chair, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) because I know that it was very much at his instigation that this seminar was organised. It brought great credit to the committee and to this parliament. It is an initiative that I would like to see the joint standing committeeâ€”of which I am very pleased to be a memberâ€”continue to pursue. I would like to see all of us here in this parliament become better versed in this question of aid.

          Aid is often a difficult question. When we are out talking to people who may be out of work or who have problems we always, as members of parliament, hear the question, `Why should we give foreign aid? Charity should begin at home'. There is a case that can be put for aid and, as members of parliament, we should be putting that case and urging the government to continue with the aid program.

           not only members of parliament but those who would normally make submissions to the full inquiry to engage in discussions on matters of importance.

         I would particularly like to extend to Margaret Swieringa, the secretary of the subcommittee on foreign affairs, and to Joanne Towner, the secretary of the full committee, my thanks for their efforts and cooperation. There is no doubt that without their efforts the seminar would have been far more difficult to arrange. Of course, it was really through their efforts that this report has been produced in this form.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the advantages of having this sort of report is that it means that there is now a base reference for those who participated in the seminar and for all those who have a general interest in aid. I have already spoken to a number of participants who have said that they have found the report very valuable. It is a concept which we can take on from here and perhaps use, from time to time, in other ways, although without derogation to normal full inquiries. It is an area where we allow people to come here and present their points of view and it gives us an opportunity to have our views exposed to them. That, of course, was very much the benefit of the day.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The report came forward with a number of recommendations and I want to identify some of those. Although it has been tabled in the House and there has been some identification in the formal presentation of the report, I think that, inevitably, with the report now under way by Dr Paul Simons, some of these issues are matters which I hope will enable people in the community to look at Australian aid perhaps a little bit more analytically than they have in the past.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is very easy, for example, to assess aid only in the term of quantum, of money available. On the other hand, there are thoseâ€”and particularly when people are in distress with high unemployment and with economic adversityâ€”who say, `Why are we giving overseas aid at all?' There is no doubt that both sides of the argument are very strongly held. They are valid points of view and yet, from Australia's national perspective, I do not think that there is any doubt that the question is not whether to maintain aid but the direction where our aid heads that we need to be concerned with.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to say a little bit about that. One can see in the report the extent to which humanitarian aid has increased over the last few years. It is quite remarkable the way in which development assistance programs have been and continue to be eroded. Page 13 of the report points out that at the beginning of the 1980s the donor community spent about $300 million a year on emergency aid. Ten years later it had become $3.2 billion. The difficulty with emergency aid is not that it can in any way be reduced but it is unfortunately then used to reduce the amount of development assistance aid provided. That means that in many instances communities are not able to advance themselves to the degree or the extent that they might otherwise have.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is important that we register that, while we do give quite a bit of assistance to NGOs, they raise a lot of their resources privately. Thirty per cent of the aid budget was provided in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 to multilateral humanitarian and emergency programs. You have to realise that in addition to the government sector provision of aid the NGO community provided something like 47 percent of its expenditure to food aid and emergency assistance. Not only is emergency aid
         <break page="5677" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          being given directly by way of the government; a great deal is being done through the NGO community.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is also a deal of aid through the defence cooperation program given by way of assistance particularly in the South Pacific. As many would know, every time there is a cyclone or a hurricane in the South Pacific, the resources of the Department of Defence are called on. Quite properly, they are used to provide sometimes temporary accommodation for people affected, sometimes transport and generally backup for the services that otherwise are absolutely destroyed or non-existent. It is very important that the long&amp;hyphen;term advantage of aid is registered as doing not much more than just providing that very temporary assistance. It is a matter of great concern, particularly if one looks at the poverty debate which is a very important element in the whole concept of where our aid goes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another aspect of the seminar that I found particularly interesting was the argument that was very strongly presentedâ€”and it is a point of view that I have always heldâ€”that, if one can help raise the living standards of people in a recipient country, that certainly helps that country in more ways than just that aid. In other words, you have to try to assess the degrees of development assistance. You can help a country to help itself. Australia has a very proud record of helping people and training people in recipient countries to undertake projects of their own.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have a record of helping people in developing the skills necessary to build water storage, to operate pumps, to build and maintain roads and maintain bridges. I think it is important that that emphasis be maintained. I am particularly concerned because of the direction in which some aid programs of other countries have gone. They provide help, but they use their own nationals to provide the aid. The outcome is nowhere near what it would be if you left behind the knowledge of how to acquire certain skills for particular projects so that people could help themselves in the future. That is a very important element of our development assistance program, and it is one that is particularly important as far as the future focus of the report is concerned and of the AusAid emphasis.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The third important area is the degree to which business can play a role and be of assistance in the aid program. It was quite remarkable that some of those present at the seminar had not realised that, if they spoke to a businessman working in the area, there were ways in which they could help each other. I hope the dialogue that occurred for the first time at the seminar can be used by the NGOs to enable them to better access people with knowledge of the area and also direct business people as to how they can contribute towards the betterment of the economy and the people in the country where they are doing business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was surprising that so many in business had not been aware of the relationship that is possible with NGOs. Equally, the NGOs which, quite properly, are concerned about raising funds and which were saying how poor business support was, did not realise that, by cooperating with businesses operating in a particular recipient country area, they could piggyback on business, use it to assist them, and that a mutual partnership opportunity existed, one which I trust will be furthered.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the report, we refer to the possibility of partnerships between the private sector, government and NGOs. We commented that it was apparent from discussions that the sectors had not previously recognised the contribution that each could make to the other's field of endeavour. It is particularly important that that be picked up and pursued.

          I am glad that my colleague the former chair of the foreign affairs and defence committee, the member for Chifley (Mr Price), is now in the Main Committee. He made a very worthwhile intervention in the area of peacekeeping proposals. One of the important parts of Australia's operation in peacekeeping has been not the military activity so much as the civilian extension of the project. One of the interventions of the honourable member for Chifley at the one&amp;hyphen;day seminar was to suggest that we look more closely at the way in which, once we have a large Australian commitment, we maximise the long&amp;hyphen;term benefit of that commitment.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I have not been to Somalia, but I am told that even today the only effective law enforcement in that country is based on the contribution made by the Australian peacekeeping detachment. That is not because the Australians are there but because they have enabled the resumption of some form of normalcy in the processes of law, in the way in which law is administered. I understand that it is Italian law which dates back to a period when the Italians were a colonial power. However, the nature of the law does not matter, it is the fact that there is a rule of law that is important.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is particularly important, therefore, that we look at ways in which both defence cooperation aid and peacekeeping forces can extend the aid opportunity so that there is a marriage of the Australian commitment to what can be done in the long term to help the people with what is being done by the Australian defence or civilian personnel who are serving there.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In that respect, I have long had the view that we really need to look at police rather than military forces. So often in peacekeeping there is a real advantage if you can encourage the civilian administration of law rather than having military personnel. Having said that, when you have police, as we have had in Cyprus for 30 years, it is a worry that we have not yet found a way of putting an end date on our commitments.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One of my real concerns is that in peacekeeping generally there has to be not just a commitment but also an understanding of the purpose of the commitment. There has to be an understanding of the period of the commitment. Objectives must be laid down. I hope I have picked up the idea of the honourable member for Chifley about the importance of what will be left after their withdrawal, because that is particularly important.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Part of the objective of the seminar was to expose the issues and to look at the degree to which the announcement by the government that the development import finance facility, or the DIFF scheme, would not be proceeded with was a problem. That has become a matter for further debate in the House since the delivery of the budget. As one who has seen a little of the application of the DIFF scheme, and who introduced the export manufacturing development grants scheme proposal long since, I think it is important that we look at how business can be involved in extending Australian influenceâ€”if I can call it thatâ€”in recipient countries.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The DIFF scheme has advantages because it gives us the opportunity to provide business involvement in projects that would otherwise not be built at the time and, indeed, if they are built and they are built with World Bank or Asian Development Bank or some other funding, are not likely to be built by Australian companies.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The DIFF scheme having gone, I hope that something of its character can be re&amp;hyphen;established, because I think there is reason for us to look at those major infrastructure programs. Together with a number of my colleagues, I had a look at the bridge that has been built across the Mekong, and a couple of weeks ago I had discussions with regard to the second bridge which is going to be built across the Mekong. They are symbolic but they are also significant; they
          <break page="5679" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           are going to be people movers. The chairman, Mr Hollis, was with me when we went across the bridge into Laos, and there is no doubt that that link between Thailand and Laos is a tremendously important symbolic physical link. And you are not likely to embark on that sort of a project unless you have some way by which you can help business into it.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So I think all those are issues which, together with the other recommendations of the report, I would commend to Dr Paul Simons. I think it is important that he does not look at the seminar as just another part of the general dialogue. I think there were recommendations in it. Certainly there are some fundamental issues, the relationship between economic growth and the alleviation of poverty being one where there was a very vigorous debate at the seminar and where I am sure no resolution was reached. But it is an issue which needs to be addressed because those sorts of issues are going to have a considerable advantage in identifying the ways by which Australian aid can best be provided. After all, what we all seek is to help the countries where we give the aid so that in the long term they can help themselves and in due course they too can make their contribution to others.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a timely moment to be reviewing development assistance, for several reasons. First of all, as the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said in his speech, about a quarter of humankind, 1.3 billion people, live in absolute poverty. Around 800 million of them are chronically malnourished. Despite rapid development in a number of countries, the number of people living in absolute poverty is still growing, and external assistance is one effective means of addressing that massive need.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, the volume of aid is falling. The unweighted Development Assistance Committee average fell from 0.45 per cent of GNP in 1994 to 0.41 per cent in 1995. In 1985, the figure was 0.46 per cent. So the volume of aid actually held up for most of the last decade until last year. Australian aid has been reduced from a two&amp;hyphen;decade peak of 0.50 per cent in 1983&amp;hyphen;84 to 0.29 per cent this year. One of the most destructive decisions in the Howard government's first budget was to reduce aid this year compared with 1995&amp;hyphen;96 by $155 million in real terms.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is driven by the decision of government to reduce outlays rather than by aid fatigue amongst voters. It is a clear example of the dominance of narrow economic doctrine over proper political processes. It would be surprising if two decades of the propaganda of mean&amp;hyphen;spirited economists in the public sector and a decade of greed in parts of the private sector had not eroded public generosity. Yet the evidence suggests that there is still a widespread general level of support for the aid program. That is particularly concentrated in disaster relief, but it is a general level of support for development cooperation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This support is soft, however, because there is great ignorance about the aid program. There has been some growth of scepticism about the effectiveness of aid, including concern about the honesty with which aid funds are handled in some countries. There is also awareness of the contribution of aid to the success of countries in East Asia, and so questioning about the continued need for development assistance to those countries. So there is a combination of a degree of complacency and of some despair around.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The structure of the Australian aid program since the Jackson report a dozen years ago has changed to give a greater attention to countries in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region and to social development. However, the proportion of funds being channelled through the multilateral
         <break page="5680" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          agencies has also increased very substantially, and that has been questioned by some. A more positive development is that there has been an increase in the proportion being allocated through non&amp;hyphen;government organisations. The rapid growth of private financial flows to emerging markets also raises the issue of whether aid is still required.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The seventh of the introductory points I want to make is that the rapid integration of the global economy is changing the context within which aid is given and received, and raises questions about the appropriateness of a voluntary system of development assistance when global interdependence is becoming so strong. For example, is it enough simply to offer assistance to countries with emerging capital markets for the management of their financial systems when disorder in one can rapidly cause disorder in many? With rapid growth in the volume of pension funds from advanced economies being invested in emerging markets, the case for external assistance to support effective, equitable, tension reducing economic and social development is strengthened.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to make a few comments on those introductory points. The rationale for development assistance remains very strong. First, it is clear that there is massive needâ€”for food; for housing; for income earning opportunities; for work; for education; for health services; for infrastructure; for access to markets; for honest legal and financial systems; for information, not least about family planning techniques; for technology; for improved plant and animal varieties; for appropriate technologies; and for access to loanable funds for some people in most countries of the world, and for many in most.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         External assistance is one effective means of supporting tackling each of those needs, provided it is given or lent in ways which have learnt from the vast and diverse experience of the last 50 years. Universal economic and social development is in the interest of all members of the global community, since economic development somewhere contributes to economic development everywhere and greater stability in one country contributes to increasing security in all the countries around us. The world has a shared interest in creating the conditions which facilitate economic security and social harmony everywhere.

         During the first half of the 1990s, private financial flows have added substantially to the resources of some developing countries, but most of this private investment has been concentrated in fewer than a dozen countries. Further increases in private financial flows to emerging countries may well occur as confidence in their profitability and reliability improves, but this offers little potential benefit for most low income countries. Concessional assistance will have vital role in the foreseeable future. The question is how this can be generated in the current fiscal climate.

         A major change in the aid paradigm would be valuable. The need to offset global market failure offers a way forward. During the last couple of decades there has been a striking increase in the extent of global integration. The explosive growth in the integration and size of global financial markets is a particularly clear example.

        <para first-indent="16">
         One effect of this growing interdependence is diminished national autonomy. There are two obvious responses. One is for governments, the private sector and civil society to seek to act as effectively as possible within the limits, aiming for the best available outcomes from national policies and action within the global constraints. The other is for countries to act together to achieve agreed goals. The role of the UN, the IMF and the World Bank is to facilitate such cooperation.

          A conceptual shift is required, a central aspect of which must be recognition of the pervasiveness of global market failure and of the incapacity of nations acting alone to cope, and of the necessity for cooperative international action to offset such failure. Just as national governments cope with market failure within their countries by organising the provision of public goods, so the international community is being compelled to respond to international market failure through expanding the provision of global public goods.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A particularly important aspect of market failure is the inability of the private sector to provide goods and services which automatically benefit everyone. This is the reason for such national public goods as the law and order system, roads, public health services and public education. It is also the principal rationale for such global public goods as the International Telecommunications Union and the services it provides, the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the World Meteorological Organisation. Their services are global public goods.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Unless every country is required to contribute to the cost of these services, the `free rider' problem arises. Allowing voluntary payment would be unfair because some countries would benefit without contributing to the cost of provision. The decline in development cooperation aid is partly due to the free rider problem. The motivation to provide aid is reduced when other countries offer little or are reducing their aid. The frequency of international aid comparisons are a clear example of this.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          During the last decade, there have been some significant extensions of global public goods, such as the negotiation and implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and the Framework Convention on Climate Change, as well as the establishment of the World Trade Organisation. However, a growing range of issues remain unaddressed or are given inadequate attention. Examples include provision of swift, adequate, emergency relief and support in response to natural disasters or to the consequences of civil war; international financial volatility; competition between countries over tax rates; economic coordination and stabilisation; drug trafficking; international migration; and protection of the global environment and management of the global commonsâ€”let alone the continuing issues of improving global economic performance by facilitating economic development in poorer countries and of improving security for all through peacekeeping and peacemaking.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Public support for expansion of the provision of global public goods will certainly increase as more governments become aware that this is the only way to equitably share the costs of effective provisionâ€”a calculation which should take only a few minutes once the issue is seriously addressed. This situation is called the `prisoner's dilemma' by economists because, unless all beneficiaries are compelled to contribute, the motivation for one or a few to provide the service voluntarily is severely undermined, since they know that non&amp;hyphen;contributors will benefit.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A crucial question is how to pay for an expanded range of global public goods. Many proposals have been made, including borrowing, user&amp;hyphen;pays fees, increased compulsory subscriptions and new taxes, such as on air travel, telecommunications, use of energy or the arms race. One possibility which deserves particular attention is a small levy on foreign exchange transactionsâ€”the Tobin tax. This would contribute to stabilising financial markets, as well as to raising revenue for governments and for international global public goods. The rationale for international revenue raising is now very strong. With growing globalisation, an increasing number of issues must be addressed, in part at least, on a global basis. Yet they
          <break page="5682" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           remain inadequate, because of a combination of the free rider problem and the prisoner's dilemma.

         <para first-indent="16">
          If this new paradigm became more widely accepted, there would be a dramatic change in the framework for economic and social development assistance. The world would move out of the era of voluntary charity, which is essentially the nature of the current aid framework, into an era of effective universal global infrastructures. This is the transition which industrial countries began to make early in the 20th century. The logic of such an international extension is watertight. Political leadership will still be required to make the transition, but pressure of circumstances will force the process to some extent. The extension of global public goods is inevitable in an orderly world. The issue is the speed and effectiveness with which the evolution occurs. The sooner it happens, the more effectively underdevelopment and poverty will be addressed.

          â€”I will be brief in my remarks on the report of the seminar held by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the Australian aid program. At the outset I will put on the record that I did not have the opportunity to attend the seminar held in Canberra on 31 July because of parliamentary and electoral commitments in the Northern Territory. I would dearly like to have attended because of the close proximity of the Northern Territory, especially Darwin, to our Asian neighbours to the north.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The seminar was particularly timely as it coincided with the United Nations' International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. The conclusions of the seminar were that it was a very good starting point for future debate and that it was needed because it had been a number of years since the Jackson report which was a comprehensive study of overseas aid provided by Australia. I am aware that Paul Simons has been appointed by the government to undertake a review of Australia's aid program and that that will be a report that I am quite sure many of my colleagues will be waiting for.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The seminar was conducted prior to the coalition's budget. Reading the report, I think an underlying factor was what the aid program was going to receive in light of the government's facing very severe budget constraints. I believe people at the seminar were very mindful of what kind of aid might be provided in the coalition budget. For the record, I would like to quote from the section on the budget in the report. Section 2.6 says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In the 1996 budget, aid received $1.45 billion, a cut of $114.4 million or 10 per cent from the previous year. The cut was made up of $93.4 million from the abolition of the Development Import Finance Facility (DIFF) Scheme and $64.9 million from country aid programs. Increases were made to compensate China, the Philippines and Indonesia for the abandonment of DIFF projects but they did not offset overall loses. Overall reductions to China will be $20 million, to Indonesia $21 million, to the Philippines $14 million, Thailand $11 million and Malaysia $14 million. Further savings are to be made from the administrative costs in AusAID. At the same time there is a small increase of some $16.9 million in the contributions to multilateral organisations such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the International Fund for Agricultural Development.
        </para>
        <para>
         I think it is important to have that in this report because, at the time, there were rumours around saying that aid programs were going to be very seriously curtailed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia over the last few years has been leading the way in providing resources to those countries in need. But, in view of the economic climate, while the 10 per cent cut may seem extravagant to some people I believe it was in accordance with government policy. The important thing in terms of the region is that it is good to see that business leaders attended
         <break page="5683" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the seminar and that their interest in developing our region was quite prominent in the contributions they made.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are couple of points I would like to talk about in relation to the aid program and its effect in some small instances on the Northern Territory. AusAid was able to provide financial assistance to some 18 midwives who came to Darwin in April this year to train. The scheme was funded by AusAid and the midwives came from most of the rural areas of Indonesia. They came for training in Darwin to improve their education and skills, so that when they went back to Indonesia they would be able to pass on that information and assist in the education and training of others in that field.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That training is very importantâ€”it is vitalâ€”because the infant mortality in rural Indonesia runs to about four out of 100, that is, four per cent. It is very high, when one considers that there are something like 65,000 villages and roughly 40,000 midwives in Indonesia, many of whom lack experience and some of whom are quite young.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This program was undertaken by the Department of Asian Relations, Trade and Industry in the Northern Territory, through its international project management unit in conjunction with the Northern Territory University. The university made a bid for the Australian component for this master midwifery train the trainer program. It is part of the Indonesian government's long&amp;hyphen;term strategy to improve the health and welfare of mothers and babies, especially in rural areas. I understand that the participants worked very hard. It took them three months to do the course in Darwin, but before they came to Darwin they had to undertake a rapid course to learn to speak English. I understand that they acquitted themselves quite well.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Somewhere along the line, the results of this type of aid, especially coming out of the regional areas where you have another Australian government involved with the federal government and with a foreign government, have to be successful because of the commitment of the three organisations, all being government organisations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other particular section related to the Northern Territory and the impact of the DIFF program, which has been abolished by the coalition government because of the problems with getting the required outcomes from the program. There was another organisation in the Northern Territory called Integrated Technical Services, with another company called Solarex. They had to put in a bid to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for aid funding to provide solar energy in the rural parts of Indonesia. That program, as we have since heard, was supported by the Indonesian government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has now seen his way clear to make some provision to allow that particular part of the DIFF program to proceed in terms of providing solar energy in the various parts of Indonesia, especially the remote parts, through a territory company.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are other instances where good use of aid to Indonesia can come out of the Australian scene. Another territory company at the moment is specialising in providing remote area services for drainage and sewerage. A lot of honourable members would be aware that providing infrastructure for sewerage for the communities can be a very costly exercise. I think that is where it starts: if some of the communities have good health, are clean and have no problems of disease because of overflowing sewage, then obviously anything that could be done or put in place to alleviate such dangers to other communities would be very important.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I believe that there is a territory company that now has the capacity to provide septic sewerage for remote areas. In fact, it has been trialling it quite well in the Northern Territory, in some of our Aboriginal communities. Hopefully, the benefit from the trial periods in the
         <break page="5684" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Northern Territory will have some impact in terms of what can be done in the overseas region, where you have large populations in remote areas spread out throughout their country.

         There you have two people making statements at the seminar who had some slight conflict. But the reason I brought it up is that, in terms of education in remote areas, I am aware that there is an Australian company which has support from the Indonesian Directorate of Remote Teaching Services to provide technology in remote areas in Indonesia whereby it is all done by satellite communication. We are talking about remote areas, but they do have television in remote areas, they do have some power, and those areas that have the capacity to accept a signal should be considered. There are something like 85,000 primary school teachers in Indonesia and its population in remote areas is in excess of 100 million, and it could be, I believe, a good teaching aid.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government could investigate this application by an Australian company in terms of the provision of service. The company wants to have a core unit of teachers broadcasting to the remote areas. In other words, you would have a primary school teacher talking by satellite to other primary school teachers in remote areas, who would then go and use that experience in teaching the children in their classroom. Moving around the Indonesian archipelago and all the islands is very difficult and very expensive and, in some cases, I believe, does not get the full support of the Indonesian government. But remote teaching by satellite certainly could be part of the aid program that we provide.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know that the Indonesians, in terms of their own aid programs that they request from the World Bank and from other countries, do have a priority book. It was already known to me a couple of years ago that the Indonesian Ministry of Education did accord a high priority to the application that the company was making in terms of getting some aid funding for it to proceed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So there are a lot of things that can be done that would help people, and obviously that is the whole aim of providing aid, to provide the necessary equipment, the necessary skills or the necessary training to help our northern neighbours make improvements in health, education and social welfare. One of the most important things in many of the remote areas of Indonesia is that they do lack proper training and proper facilities, and that can only come through education. I believe that the aid program that has been earmarked for the Indonesian region has some benefit to them and I believe it will have a long&amp;hyphen;term benefit for the Australian community.

         It is very important that committees of the parliament are relevant to the Australian people.

I am not saying that there is not a role for that, but the seminar initiative taken by the committee and the chairman was a very good one. It was certainly topical in view of the controversy surrounding the cutting of DIFF funding and the announcement of a review of aid. I hope we will see more such seminars.

         Things have changed a little since that seminar. A notable first speech has been made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) that has set a few hares running in this countryâ€”rather regrettable hares, I must say. In my area I used to be questioned quite frequently by members of the public and my branch members about why Australia gave overseas aid. I would always do my best to answer those questions, but I was not able to convince people until I described some of the very worthwhile Australian aid projects and the impact they had on individual countries.

As much as we might like to become super&amp;hyphen;isolationists in Australia, that is not going to be a viable policy, or a good long&amp;hyphen;term policy. Our best long&amp;hyphen;term policy, I believe, is being good, world corporate citizens. In a country blessed with the riches that we do have, that really means that we have an obligation to assist others.

         Probably, the former government has been more responsible than others in suggesting that we need to focus on Asia. I certainly believe that. I think that that is a good thing. But all too often it has been interpreted somehow as though we do not have obligations to other parts of the world. When we become members of things like the United Nations and other world bodies, we sign up as world citizensâ€”not half citizens, not quarter citizens, but full world citizens. Let me say this: if we do not see the African continent as part of our high priority area, then as we go into the next millennium, unless we can see the condition of the African people improve economically as well as in human rights terms, it is going to be a continual source of problems for us and the rest of the world. We have a great interest in trying to build on the foundations that have come with the ending of apartheid in South Africa, and in ensuring that other southern African countries enjoy democracy, economic progress and the fruits of the rule of law. Regrettably, at the moment, as much as some of us are African optimists, really, the prospects are not that good. I want to just make that point.

          â€”Like the previous speakers, I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on the motion to take note of the report of the seminar on the Australian foreign aid program by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. As a long term supporter and campaigner for several organisations heavily involved in Australia's overseas aid program, it has been very interesting for me to read this report and to note the recommendations contained therein. Like other speakers, I would also like to congratulate the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) for his foresight in having his committee convene the seminar to discuss in general terms the Australian aid program .

         As previous speakers have also noted, since the March 1996 election certain members of this House have really challenged us to think long and hard on the issues of Australia's involvement in the area of foreign aid. Those who have known me have often heard me say that if you have nothing nice to say about someone, keep your mouth shut. With that in mind, I would like to counteract in a positive way what I see as some rather intolerant remarks both by some members of this House and by some of the media commentators who are peddling populist views which seem to be gaining favour with the various media outlets and driving commentary in this country.

         The doers in this society are appalled at this new wave of populism which sees overseas aid and development as something that is irrelevant and unnecessary. We hear the catchcry, `Let's fix our own backyard first. Why should we care about these people?' In the few moments I have allocated to me I would like to put on record examples of two movements that I have been long aware of, but that some people might not be.

         I recently attended a Results International conference in Washington DC where I met one of the people who are having a profound influence on the world. This lady is Dr Vicky Guzman. She is the founder and director of an organisation called ASAPROSAR in El Salvador. She completed her medical training in 1972 and then decided to work in the mountainous areas of western El Salvador, treating people and training health workers in each of the villages. Poverty, illiteracy and disease were rampant and many children died of diarrhoea, malnutrition and parasites.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Through her good work she managed to convince, through the civil war period, the Campesino leaders from the rural mountain areas whom she managed to train as health promoters in their various villages. Despite the civil war, after 10 years of operation ASAPROSAR has achieved what I guess you could call monumental monuments to their success. In 10 years it has increased its service to approximately 80,000 people in the rural mountain districts of western El Salvador. It has grown from a staff of one physicianâ€”Dr Guzmanâ€”and three social workers to a staff of over 50 people. They have established three rural clinics and eight maternal child health centres. More remarkably, they have trained 800 volunteer promoters in health, midwifery, child development and early intervention programs, and have hugely decreased the morbidity and mortality rates of children in that part of El Salvador.

         The other spectacular organisation is the Grameen Bank, which many members might not be aware of. Twenty&amp;hyphen;two years ago in a village in Bangladesh, Dr Yunus, a professor of economics at the nearby university, happened to come across a young villager who was desperately trying to alleviate the poverty in her village. She used to weave bamboo furniture
         <break page="5688" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          and was desperately in need of some capital. The going rate at the time was 300 per cent interest a year. Most of the world's poor are caught in this trapâ€”they are thoroughly exploited either by their employer or the money&amp;hyphen;lending elite. They cannot borrow from banks because they cannot provide any collateral.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With a few dollars loan from the professor, it took this young villager only a few months to establish her own self&amp;hyphen;employment. She increased her income sevenfold and repaid the loan. From this modest beginning grew a bank which today employs 12,000 staffâ€”unlike some of the banks in this countryâ€”works in 35,000 villages of Bangladesh and extends four million loans a year. In just the past two years it has extended half of the money which it has lent over the past two decades. Each month it extends new loans totalling between $US30 million and $US40 million and its loan repayments exceed 99.5 per cent, which means it outperforms all other banks in Bangladesh and most banks around the world.

         It is interesting that this debate is being held today, the day before the one set asideâ€”probably most people do not knowâ€”as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. This is the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. The United Nations has dedicated this year as the beginning of the decade to end poverty. There are more than sufficient resources in the world; what is required is the will to achieve it. There is an emerging groundswell of opinion in the community towards ridding the world of the evils of hunger and poverty.

         Six years ago in September, 140 countries were represented at the World Summit for Children. Australia was included at that gathering. Six years ago, governments throughout the world committed themselves to achieving a set of goals by the year 2000. These included reduction of child mortality by one third; reduction in child malnutrition by half; cutting of infant mortality by half; access to primary education, with completion by 80 per cent; and universal access to safe drinking water and sanitation. In the last few years there have been some notable achievements directed at achieving these goals. For example, 108 countries have achieved the 1995 interim target of 80 per cent immunisationâ€”probably a figure in excess of what is achievable here in Australiaâ€”and 45 have achieved the year 2000 target of 90 per cent.

         It is interesting to note the mention by the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) of the fact that 358 billionaires in this world have more income than 45 per cent of the world's population. Put that alongside the fact that between 35,000 and 40,000 children are dying daily from preventable diseases like measles, diarrhoea and whooping cough. We have one billion people living in absolute poverty and the gap between the rich and poor continues to widen.

         As I said, there is a desire and a will. It is incumbent upon us as federal politicians to set ourselves a goal of having the political will to try to resolve some of these seemingly insurmountable problems. Tomorrow a multi&amp;hyphen;partisan parliamentary group is going to be formed to provide an avenue for ongoing lobbying on the issue of Australia's commitment on international aid. Hopefully, this group will agree as one of its aims to set itself up as a council of parliamentarians. We have done this because in February next year a micro&amp;hyphen;credit summit in Washington DC will attract close to 4,000 participants from around the world. Their goal is to promote and set about achieving some of the goals that this international decade for the eradication of poverty has as its main aims.

       (2) There are around 360,000 LMP providers and millions of program payment records currently held on the Department's computer systems. Area and Regional staff in Victoria and National Office would be required to undertake exhaustive manual searches of thousands of these records to fully satisfy this part of the honourable member's question. There is no systems&amp;hyphen;based solution to providing the information in the format that has been requested and I am not, therefore, prepared to authorise the use of scarce Departmental resources for this purpose.

       (1), (2) and (4)â€”There is an extraordinarily large amount of detail involved in providing an answer to the Honourable Member's question. Labour Market Programs (LMPs) have been in place since the early 1970s and have been subject to significant changes over that period. New programs have been introduced, some discontinued and others have had their client eligibility criteria and program parameters changed. Statistics at the program level are, however, available from the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs's (DEETYA) computer systems from 1990&amp;hyphen;91 onwards. To go back further would, however, require a significant use of Departmental resources which I am not prepared to authorise.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The following tables set out details of LMP activity since 1990&amp;hyphen;91, for the Honourable Member's information. I have also provided the Honourable Member with a copy of the DEETYA booklet entitled "Programs 1995&amp;hyphen;96" which outlines all current LMPs.
