           The appointment of the committee is not yet resolved. Indeed, it is the very question of the composition of its membership which is the subject of negotiation between the Houses. I feel that no action should occur which could be taken to anticipate the final decision of either House in this matter. Therefore, it is not appropriate that I report to the House at this stage details of the messages concerning membership of that proposed committee.

         Basically what this does is increase the number of members from 11 to 12. The initial modification which occurred in the Senate was effectively to add an opposition senator. We were of a mind to accept that, and we did so in the Senate. However, an anticipated change was not assented to by the Senate: that there be an extra government member from the House. So there is a view on this side of the chamber that the basis on which those arrangements were entered into was not fully conformed with by the Senate. Hence the amendment that we put forward here.

          It is a general practice on joint committees that a relative balance is maintained that reflects the numbers in the House of Representatives, in particular, in these arrangements. Therefore, I have moved to effectively add a government House of Representatives member to the committee. I have no particular reason to believe that if we were to pass this motion the Senate would reject it.

          Basically, the problem alluded to was a suggestion that by virtue of a change of numbers in the Senate there will no longer be two government officers presiding. As I understand the arrangements which occurred in the Senate previously, the minority parties in the Senate—which still have the numbers in terms of cross-bench control, irrespective of the outcome of the last Senate election—previously decided that they did not like the Liberal Party nominee for Deputy President, Senator Noel Crichton-Browne. I understand that either the decision has been made not to put him forward again on this occasion or, if he is to be put forward again, it is now considered by the minority parties that he is potable and therefore they will be prepared to vote for him.

It emphatically has not done that. It has agreed to put forward an acceptable candidate for one of those positions. Be that as it may, there is still upon us a requirement to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of opposition and government members on this joint committee, and I am glad that the Opposition, as I said at the outset, is standing by past practice in this regard.

But subsequently, as I understand the position, the Senate inserted additional clauses in the second and third Bills to be dealt with here this morning. Certainly, the coalition supports absolutely the first Bill and its contents as they flow through to the other legislation, as will be detailed by the honourable member for Berowra.

         Mr Speaker, facing the House are two problems on which I seek your clarification. Firstly, how can we debate this Bill in the knowledge of how matters will be treated in the other two Bills? Secondly, and more particularly, what happens if you take a view that the Senate's amendments do not fall within the Standing Orders on the proceedings of the Parliament relating to the drafting of amendments, leave to introduce a Bill and like matters? Therefore, I simply seek your guidance and clarification for the House on this unique circumstance, whilst reiterating our very strong support for the contents of the listed securities Bill to end notional capital gains tax.

         This is a pressing matter. The Department of Social Security is gearing up to administer this new test, which commences in September. If we are to put an early end to that expensive process, it needs to be done at a time which enables the department to gear up—to gear down might be more appropriate—and to stop the process. Otherwise we are only putting the Australian taxpayers to a good deal of expense in computer equipment and subjecting pensioners to intrusive questions about their securities.

          —I wish to advise the House that the Senate amendment to this Bill raises an issue to do with the interpretation of the Constitution. Paragraph 3 of section 53 of the Constitution provides that the Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. The Senate amendment to this Bill would overturn changes already made in the principal Act, and due to be effective from 20 September. The substance of those changes is that, from 20 September, an increase in the value of shares or other listed securities held by a person will be included in the calculation of the person's income for the purposes of benefits.

          If the Senate amendment is agreed to, from 20 September a beneficiary would not have a change in the value of shares, et cetera, included in his or her income calculations. Looked at from the point of view of section 53, the matter is unclear. The burden on the people after 20 September would, in this aspect, be no greater than it would be before that date. After 20 September the impact is uncertain. Still, it is probable that some persons would become eligible for a benefit or for an increased benefit, but a person will not necessarily be better off being on a dividend basis, as at present, rather than on a share value basis. Further, notional losses that would otherwise be allowed will not be available if the amendment is made, thus affecting entitlements.

          Similar issues arise in respect of the Senate amendment to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. It is for this House to decide whether it wishes to take any action on these matters. In my view, it needs to be recognised that it is very difficult to be confident about the eventual financial impact of the proposals. It also has to be recognised that the burden on the people may, in this aspect, be no greater after 20 September than it will be before then. I present a copy of a short paper on this matter.

          SENATE AMENDMENT TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL 1993

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Senate's amendment to the Social Security Amendment Bill 1993 raises the issue of the requirement of the third paragraph of s. 53 of the Constitution which provides that the Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         By its inclusion of a new Part 1A in the Social Security Amendment Bill 1993 the Senate has proposed a change in the provisions of the Principal Act in so far as the treatment of shares and other listed securities is concerned.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The background is that by Social Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1992 the Parliament inserted changes in the Principal Act to come into effect from 20 September 1993.(1) The particular changes in question were to the effect that, from 20 September, changes in the value of shares and other listed securities were to be treated in the same way as changes in the value of certain other types of investments. One of the effects would be that from that date an increase in the value of shares would need to be included in the calculation of a person's income and this will mean that in many cases a person's notional income will be increased, and so their entitlement to a benefit reduced (it also has to be recognised that the reverse could happen and a decline in the value of a person's shares could lead to a notional reduction in income and thus an entitlement to a greater benefit). The purpose of the Senate amendment is to ensure that the changes already made in the Principal Act and due to be effective from 20 September do not proceed.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A private Senators' Bill introduced by Senator Patterson(2) and subsequently passed by the Senate contained very similar provisions except that it had an additional provision to the effect that although the details of the law would be changed no benefits could be paid or payable until the Parliament passed a law to appropriate the necessary money.(3) This important qualification has not been included in the Senate amendment to the Social Security Amendment Bill.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The issue for consideration is a difficult one because:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         the amendment does not deal immediately with or alter the particular proposals put before the Parliament in the Social Security Amendment Bill 1993, rather it changes, in the way described, provisions already inserted in the Principal Act but provisions which have not yet come into effect;
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         as is often the case in these matters it is impossible to be precise about the financial impact of the change (although it is noted that when the provisions which are now in prospect of being reversed were introduced it was estimated that significant savings would be made(4)—but this has been a matter of dispute in so far as it has arisen in connection with the Social Security (Listed Securities) Bill(5);
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         the change resulting from the Senate amendment could have an effect either way, depending on whether shares held by beneficiaries increase or decrease in value—ie. only some might receive an increased benefit;
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         the effect in practice is that a particular beneficiary in receipt of a pension before 20 September this year will, if the Senate amendment is agreed to, not have an increase in the value of shares included in income calculations after 20 September. On the other hand, if it were not for the amendment, such a person would have this fact taken into account from 20 September and in some cases a lower benefit would be payable. In other words the effect of the amendment will be that the "burden on the people" will be no greater than it would otherwise be in the period up to 20 September but it will probably be greater than it would otherwise have been in the period after 20 September.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A similar amendment has been made by the Senate in respect of the Veteran's Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. The points made in relation to the Social Security Amendment Bill are also relevant in that case.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In the paper prepared in this office and tabled on 9 November 1992, the view was expressed that in considering such matters (ie., whether any particular proposal by the Senate should be made by way of an amendment or a request) the only satisfactory approach was for each case to be looked at on its merits; the detail of a proposed amendment needed to be looked at in the context of the bill in question and with reference to any existing principal legislation. It proposed that, rather than applying a strict test of logic, regard had to be had to the intended and expected practical outcome of the proposed amendments.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In these particular cases, the outcome is by no means clear. It is certainly possible, and indeed probable, that, should the amendments be agreed to, because the effect of the 1992 amendments will be negated, the burden on the people will be greater than it would otherwise be in the period after 20 September this year. As noted above however the burden will not be changed by these amendments from the burden applying before that date. In addition, the effect of the amendment:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         would be to continue the present regime under which dividends from shares are included in income calculations (the 1992 changes would have "income" calculated on the basis of changed values, regardless of dividends);
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         could be to allow a fall in the value of a person's shares to be offset against other investment income for the purposes of any entitlement.

         Whilst this is certainly a matter which should be drawn to the attention of Members, the issues are such that it is difficult to predict with any confidence what the impact will be in so far as the "burden on the people" is concerned.

It is one of the major issues of contention between the Government and the Opposition, as to what the impact of this proposal might be.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The Government has, from time to time, offered some views as to estimated savings that might be made as a result of this measure. Therefore, I imagine it would argue that there will be a cost to revenue if these proposals are to be reinstated.

         The shortcoming—which will be a major matter in the debate that follows—is the basis upon which the Government's calculations are made. It made assumptions that there will be absolutely no changes in the behaviour of people who presently own shares and their ability to assume that the savings that they estimate are likely. It is certainly beyond doubt that pensioners who are shareholders will change their behaviour as a result of any legislative changes left in place after this debate. The impact of those changes will mean that the estimated savings will not be present. Therefore, Mr Speaker, your comments and observations are quite correct, and I thank you for the support you have given me. It is very difficult to be confident that there are savings to the revenue involved in this measure.

        The current legislation, which was passed in 1992, contains a definition of an investment product and provides for all investment products to have capital gain or loss and income distributions counted when working out a rate of return to be used for that investment under the income test. A listed security is currently included within the definition of `investment product', thus allowing capital gain or capital loss on a listed security to be counted under the income test. The Senate amendment will remove the word `listed security' from the definition of an investment product. This will mean that a listed security can only be assessed for income test purposes under the general definition of `income', which is not specific enough to allow inclusion of capital gain or capital loss.

Yet it is now saying that it will not let us bring in an Act—similar provisions are already in existence—which will allow us to treat invested shares in the same way as other managed investments have been treated since 1988. The Opposition will not allow us to have a situation where we have projected savings of approximately $80 million—$60 million in the Department of Social Security budget and approximately $20 million in the veterans affairs budget.

We are simply bringing these share treatments into line with other managed investments. As a result of our treating managed investments in a certain way since 1988, the pensioner population has not stopped investing in such things as equity trusts, property trusts and other sorts of managed investments. In fact, quite the opposite has happened: there has been an increase in those sorts of investments.

They will stop that. If anything, the opposite is occurring to what I am sure Opposition members have been saying publicly and what they will say here today. Historically, when similar rules were introduced to managed investments pensioners continued to invest in that area. It is not in the interests of pensioners to gift away their assets, to leave the stock market, or to run around and put those investments where they will not be getting the same rate of return. They would be worse off if they did that. Regardless of what the Opposition thinks, pensioners are pretty smart.

         The grossest politics that have ever been played with the most vulnerable people in Australia were those played by the Labor Party when it promised, in good faith one thought, that it would remove all pensioners from the taxation system, but immediately walked away from that promise after the election; it promised pensioners a dental health system, which we now know it is walking away from as hard as it can go; it promised the charities that work amongst the most vulnerable people that, for every dollar they raised to look after the needy and the destitute in our community, it would subsidise them dollar for dollar. But what did the Government do after the election? It walked away from that promise as fast as it could and said, `Oh, no. We don't have to give you as much if we only subsidise the expenditure that you actually make on the needy. Any money you raise for your running costs won't be covered'.

         Let me make it very clear to the Parliamentary Secretary, as the Speaker made clear in his own statement, that these particular provisions will not in any way produce savings for this Government. The Government will be as successful in recouping savings in this area as it was with its sales tax imposed on luxury motor vehicles. When the Government legislated and introduced those provisions, it found that people changed their behaviour. It then had to walk away from those provisions and to repeal them. That is what is going to happen in this very area; the cost of implementing these proposals over three years is $3.5 million.

         Computer people are gearing up special programs—and I think this probably understates it—in order that they can trace people's shareholdings.

         The Parliamentary Secretary is saying that, in relation to these capital increases that occur in the value of shares, the impact of the proposals will be to reduce the income—that is, the pension—that is paid to pensioners who own shares. The pensioners will not have sold their shares, but the Government is deeming that the pensioners will have made a profit on the value of those shares, and it will reduce the pension as income. On the Government's own estimates, it is taking 60,000 people—something of the order of 400 people in each of our electorates—and reducing their income by, on average, $1,000 a year. The Government is saying to those people, `We know you are going to have a thousand dollars less. You are living on a very meagre income but you can sell your shares in order to survive. Shares are marketable. Sell your shares in order to survive. You can live off that capital increment in lieu of the reduced pension'.

         Yet in another breath the Government wants us to believe that we can do some calculations—the Parliamentary Secretary has kindly given me these calculations—in which people can estimate program savings. The assumption the Government has made is that with every pensioner who owns shares it can estimate capital gains and assume that there will always be capital gains in place. It does not ever look at the prospect, I suppose, that there will be a share collapse, as we saw in recent years, that nobody will change their behaviour, or whether the impact of these proposals will yield those savings that it estimates are there to be made.

The Parliamentary Secretary finds some solace in the fact that because additional people have become eligible for pensions—in many cases they would be only part-pensions—there has been an increase in the number of people who own shares. From his brief, he told us that 60 per cent of those people were new pensioners—something of the order of 16,000 new pensioners who had shareholdings had come into the system—and a smaller figure, 40 per cent or about 10,000 existing pensioners presumably, had acquired shares.

I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that since the election there has been a good deal of publicity associated with these proposals. That is what is hurting the Government so much. That is why some government members are not in the chamber to take part in this debate. I will produce the letters that they are writing to their constituents in which they say, `We will have another look at this'.

We have made assumptions on the figures, on the basis of what is on the record, what has happened in the past with other types of managed investments. According to the Opposition, those assumptions are incorrect. Its assumptions as to what might happen, as to what might be the case, are plucked out of the air. At best they are very, very hypothetical. Our assumptions are based on available, detailed information. We reject the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Berowra.

         The simple facts are that we are talking about a change which will stop a travesty of justice. The Parliamentary Secretary said something about fairness. I thought that was the principle that applied to all the decisions we made here, and this is not fair. It is not fair because it sets out to tax—I underline the word `tax'—unrealised gains. That, to me, is a wealth tax. If it has feathers, swims like a duck and walks like a duck, it is a duck. The Government is introducing the first wealth tax ever to be implemented in Australia because it is taxing people on something they have not got.

         The Government is applying a tax to those pensioners by reducing a government entitlement. The Government makes some reference to the fact that these people are avoiding some sort of capital gain. Of course they are not avoiding it. Clearly the department can add that value to their asset value and, as such, under the assets test the Government can adjust entitlements, but it wants both. The Government wants to be able to adjust their entitlement under the assets test and get them a bit more regularly.

         The Government is attacking a specific group of people—those who have chosen to structure their retirement income on the basis of a shareholding. I remind government members that many of these people bought in at a higher price than currently exists, but the Government is using that low base for the purpose of assessing any increase in the value of these assets. The Government is telling these people to sell off their income base little by little until they approach starvation. That is silly. The honourable member for Berowra is quite right: as they sell off this asset to compensate for the reduction in their income, the point will eventually be reached where these people are 100 per cent on the pension.

Firstly, as the honourable member for Berowra points out, they are often contracted arrangements; and, secondly, because of the disaster of the recession we had to have, many people find they cannot escape them. Some are unsaleable and others, of course, have values at which people cannot afford to part with them. I do not think nearly as many of them—

         In the meantime, we are generating substantial hardship for people, particularly those who made their share investments in more prosperous times, before the recession we had to have, and who are sticking with those shares, as many have stuck with their managed investments, hoping to simply recover their original investment. The Government is saying, `If you want to be in that position and your shares have to increase possibly 100 per cent in value before you recover your original investment, we will tax you through reduced pensions for every cent of gain'. That is what the Government is on about. I think it is outrageous.

         —This debate on the Social Security Amendment Bill is another example of a government which has made an art form of the politics of compassion on the one hand and, since the election, the politics of deception on the other. When this legislation was first introduced into the chamber in November last year, it was no less than a Trojan horse; it was a political piece of paper. It was a document brought in here deliberately to try to embarrass the Opposition. It was couched in terms which said to the Opposition, `If you oppose the nasties in this Bill, we will be able to go to the 900,000 or so pensioner beneficiaries in this legislation and say, "It is the Opposition which is stopping you getting your pension increases"'—a blatant, clear-cut, political act.

         This morning the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) came in here and suggested to the Opposition, `But you supported the Bill'. The honourable gentleman has chosen to forget that of course we supported the proposals to increase benefits to welfare recipients. Most of them are there because of the policies of this Labor Government. Of course we supported those people getting improvements in their standard of living, small though they may be. But we also took the opportunity—and many opposition speakers did so, including myself when I led the debate—to make the point that the proposals on the inclusion of unrealisable capital gains had some serious problems.

         For us to do anything less than that would be to deny our responsibility to the Australian people, especially to those 107,000 pensioners—a new figure on the 80,000 referred to in November last year—who are facing the reality of a fundamental change in the structure of their income. I made it clear on that occasion that the Opposition believed that this aspect of the Bill should be reviewed. We gave a commitment then that in the event of our winning the election there would most certainly be a review. As the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has clearly identified in his private member's Bill since then, if we were in government we would simply remove these proposals from the legislation.

         —That is correct. One of the documents given to the shadow Minister noted the following: 72 per cent of pensioners most commonly invested in bank investments, 11 per cent in bonds and debentures, and seven per cent in managed investments; less than six per cent of pensioners own real estate, apart from their own home; and only approximately one per cent of pensioners receive income from real estate. Most pensioners who hold real estate are likely to do so for lifestyle reasons—for example, holiday homes—rather than investment purposes. The reason the Government wanted to make this reform is that, consequent to the changes in 1988, it noted an increase in the number of people making investments through shares and, therefore, a decreased number of people making investments through fixed interest securities; in other words, a transfer from fixed interest securities to market linked securities.

         I made some observations on 5 November last year which I think need to be repeated in this context. I gave some examples of what effect these proposals will have on actual investor pensioners. It is also worth noting the figures which were quoted then by the Government. It said six per cent would be affected. One of the estimates given to me by the department was that 84,000 pensioners would be affected; now we know the figure is 107,000. Of that number, 20,000 would have a pension reduction of less than $10 a week; 1,500 would have a reduction of $100 a week; and 150, with shareholdings of $60,000 or more, would be liable to have their part-pensions cancelled unless they fundamentally changed the structure of their holdings. A press report suggested that the average pensioner would lose up to $700 per year in pension. Of course, that was disputed by the Government, but as the numbers have now gone up I think the Parliamentary Secretary should once again state, for the benefit of the chamber, precisely what the anticipated statistics are.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One of the examples I gave, which goes to the crux of this whole problem, concerned a pensioner with a mixed portfolio of say $20,000—we were told that the average at that time was $15,000 and I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what the average is now; it may have gone up—returning a fully franked dividend of say $1,000 and an unrealised capital gain of $2,000. At present the dividend of $1,000 is counted under the income test, reducing the pension by $500 at the rate of 50c in the dollar. That is the current arrangement. We all understand that.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But under the legislation as proposed at that time and as it will be implemented, that same pensioner's unrealised capital gain of $2,000 will cost a further loss of $1,000 on that pension. The net overall effect, counting dividend and capital gain, is therefore a net loss of $1,500. That is clearly, by any stretch of the imagination, a fundamental change in the potential for disposable income of a person on that income level.

         Alternatively, to protect the pension, the pensioner could realise the capital gain—as the Government obviously wishes—and pay capital gains tax plus the 50c in the dollar withdrawal rate on the pension, resulting in an effective marginal rate of tax of approximately 66c in the dollar. I ask my colleagues: is anybody in the work force in this country asked to pay 66c in the dollar income tax? The answer is clearly no. But if a pensioner has some shareholdings and some small dividend income it is hard luck, because that pensioner will be up for 66c in the dollar.

         The overall outcome is that the only way to avoid the assessment of unrealised capital gain would be to invest in property to circumvent the income test. We have been told in the statistics I quoted earlier that very few people—six per cent—do that. The other point which has been raised by people in the industry and which I think is worth noting is that a pensioner could buy shares offshore and therefore circumvent these proposals. Again, this is an issue which I think the Parliamentary Secretary should refer to.

We raised these fundamental problems then and we have gone even further. We have developed a private member's Bill to reinforce the fact that those problems are still very much in place. Here we are for the second time simply asking the Government to face up to the fact that there are problems here. The formula which is being applied must be reviewed.

Once more, none of those fearful things occurred. The deeming provisions were introduced and pensioners found that they made more money through those provisions than they had previously.

The Government is not looking to save money but is trying to spread the benefits of social security to more people. Money is not put back into Consolidated Revenue.

On the one hand, he talked about all these pensioners who will be badly affected, how much money they will lose and how unfair it is. On the other hand, he says that the Government will not make the savings anyway. If as a result of this measure we are to affect the pensions of all these people, how is it that we are not making the savings? That conflict has not been explained.

         We have also had the other furphy introduced in this debate, `Oh, here we have one more broken promise by the Government'. Let us not forget when this measure was introduced by the Government. It was announced in the Budget and was introduced in legislation in this House in November or December last year. So the people of Australia, when they went to the polls on 13 March, knew exactly what they were voting for. This was part of the policy platform of the Government. They knew what they wanted and we got increased support from the aged community around this country. That is the reality.

         This was part of our platform when we went to the election, and the people of Australia supported it because they recognised that it was a fundamental part of our social justice objective to better target our social security payments and to make sure that it was a fair and equitable system. They knew that we were the ones that would introduce that. They also knew that what the Opposition would do would have a massive impact on their income and their living standards by slashing so much money off social welfare—some $10 billion. So let us not talk about broken promises. We went to the people of this country telling them clearly what we were going to do and they reelected us with an increased majority. So do not tell us that this is some form of broken promise. The second thing is that the savings we are making here are implementing another promise that we made and that is to introduce the fringe benefits to all part-pensioners.

         The Government frequently refers to aligning the treatment of shares with managed investment and equity trusts, but there is a vast difference between the way in which managed investments and equity trusts operate compared with shares. Indeed, the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) referred to the most fundamental of those differences in his own defence of this action: that is, the ability for people to buy and sell shares at will. The freedom to move in and out of managed investment and equity trusts does not exist in that way, so there is a vast difference in those particular styles of investment.

         In a letter to me only last month, the Parliamentary Secretary said that `unrealised capital gain on shares reduces the real need of the person for social security assistance'. That is absolute nonsense. Unrealised gain, unrealised income, is of absolutely no value in protecting a person from the need for social security assistance. It does not buy bread; it does not pay rent; it does not meet the daily expenses. Income is worth while only when it is realised. When it is realised it is included—and rightly so—in the income test when the shares are sold. When there has been an increase in the value of the shares, the assets test increases. That is perfectly fair. It is quite reasonable to include capital gain in asset tests; it is totally unreasonable to include unrealised gain in the income tests. Unearned, non-existent income is being treated as though it were actually there and able to be used to buy bread, food and clothing when, in reality, it is not there.

         The Government is introducing this measure in a totally unfair way. It is assuming that all shares have an opening value. That value has been assessed as at September 1992. The Government knows that share values were at a historically low level at that time, so pensioners are going to be accused of having a capital gain on shares when in fact the value of those shares may well be lower than the purchase price. The Government is assuming that pensioners have had a gain, that the shares have earned money, when in fact they are worth less than was paid for them.

         Let me relate to honourable members an example of a constituent of mine who inherited some Coles Myer shares. Those shares are of great personal value to her, largely in the same way that some people regard their stamp collections as having a great deal of sentimental value. She acquired these shares from her grandfather, whose company was one of those swallowed up in the development of the Coles Myer empire. She has no intention or wish ever to sell the shares. She wants to pass them through the family as a recognition of her grandfather's business. She will no longer be able to keep those shares and retain her pension, because the gain on those inherited shares is going to be assessed and will result in a loss of income for her from her pension. That is the kind of measure that this Government considers fair. It is all right to collect clocks, stamps, boats, et cetera, as that sort of capital gain will not be taken into account. But people who happen to inherit shares will lose their pension.

He is therefore putting his head in the noose, because he is now introducing a measure which will force pensioners to reduce their income. To satisfy the Government, they will have to sell their shares, which are earning perhaps six, eight, or 10 per cent, and put the money somewhere where it will earn four per cent. That is the kind of measure the Government is proposing to put in place.

         Is the Parliamentary Secretary suggesting that pensioners are just going to sit there and allow their income to be reduced when there are measures that they can undertake to lower their income artificially and therefore qualify for a higher pension? The sort of measure the Government is proposing to introduce demonstrates total inconsistency. Of course if pensioners go out and sell their shares, they will have to pay capital gains tax on them as well if those shares were purchased after September of 1985.

         The Government claims that a pensioner rort has been going on, and that pensioners have been using capital gains on shares to avoid the income test. The Government thinks that as a result of stopping this rort $60 million will be saved—although the figure has now been raised to $80 million. I am amused by the Parliamentary Secretary again claiming he has all these detailed mathematical calculations so he can guarantee that he can deliver these savings to the Government. If they are so detailed, why does he keep changing the numbers? When this Bill was introduced back in November 60,000 people were going to be affected. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) issued a press release on 6 May, putting the number of 84,000. The Minister now has it at 107,000. It is about time they made up their mind if those numbers are supposed to have been so accurately calculated.

         The Government has not taken into account in its numbers the reaction of pensioners to these new measures. Clearly pensioners will alter their patterns of investment. They will change their arrangements so that the alleged savings will, in reality, not exist. Another fact that has to be taken into account is that if the value of pensioners' shares drop, they may become eligible for a pension that they are not currently able to receive. Indeed, had this measure been introduced about three years ago and not today, it would have cost the Government money every year rather than achieved any savings. Clearly there will be occasions in the future, too, when this measure will end up being a liability for the Government. That will occur in those years when share values drop, and as a result the Government's own income will have dropped. This measure is clearly a very poor example of risk management. The Government will have increased liabilities in times when the value of pensioners' shares drops and when they will therefore start to apply for higher pensions. That will occur at times when the Government can ill afford it.

         The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), in his defence of this system, acknowledged that savings would be minimal. The Speaker, in his comments on this measure, indicated that it was impossible to ascertain whether there would actually be any savings at all or whether there would be liabilities for the Government. So, clearly, independent observers and the Government's own speakers have acknowledged that the savings are likely to be negligible, if they exist at all.

         The Government's measures are being introduced with only one thought in mind, and that is to spitefully treat those pensioners who have put aside during their working days for their own retirement. I thought we should be encouraging people to provide for their own retirement. This Government gives lip service to that principle with its compulsory superannuation arrangements. But, in reality, when pensioners actually take such measures on their own account and buy shares so they will have something to live on in their retirement, this Government is introducing measures which will penalise those people. It is encouraging welfare dependency, a reliance on the Government and taxpayers, rather than rewarding those who make the extra effort to care for themselves.

         —The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) clearly does not understand what is going on here, with respect. These measures were announced in the Budget of 1992. He is putting up the proposition that somehow the Government knew that the stock market was going to go up and that we particularly sought September 1993 as the implementation date for these measures because all of a sudden there has been an increase in the stock market. I remind him that this decision was made in the Budget process of August 1992, and the date in terms of the treatment of the value of the shares in this measure was fixed at September 1993. If he is trying to suggest that the Government somehow knew that there would be an increase in the stock market during that period, I wish I had known that myself.

         The fact is that no-one knows how the stock market is going to go. At the moment it is in a profit situation but the stock market is such that people, if they want to, can divest themselves of some of their shares, but not all of them. They would have to do that if they had property, collectables or antiques. They would have to sell the whole of the investment. With shares they only need a portion of their investment and they can readily sell shares on the stock market from day to day. So it is not comparing oranges with oranges to say that a collectable, a property or an antique clock is the same as shares. It is a nonsense to suggest that.

I will comment further about that later, but people have had a very long time to decide what they will do. This legislation is not a Trojan horse. The Government went to the public in March and the public knew what the proposal was. An investor who is astute enough to want to buy shares and have large shareholdings does not do it off his or her own back; that investor would go to financial planners and investment advisers. If it is being suggested that investment advisers did not know of these provisions, then they are not much good and I suggest that people should not be going to them.

         At present pensioners receive dividends from the shares they own and these dividends are regarded as income earned by the pensioner. Any growth in the value of shares was previously regarded as an increase in one's assets.

Unfortunately, I was wrong. This legislation, in essence, distinguishes pensioners from all other groups with regard to the holding of shares. If, for example, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) held shares in a piggery company, he would be taxed on any dividends he received from that company. However, if the value of the shares rose he would not be penalised in any other way until he sold them, when he would of course be liable for capital gains tax.

If honourable members think for one moment that people will hold on to these shares, they can think again. It was stated to me quite categorically at the meeting last week that they would be selling their shares, because they are embattled enough as it is trying to get by under the treatment that has been meted out to them, and this was just another brick in the wall.

         While this is the best option for pensioners, for many it is not the desired option, as we have heard in some convincing argument from this side of the chamber. Unfortunately, it is the only option for pensioners and it is unfortunate that they are left with little choice but to sell their shares. I would like to mention a pensioner in my electorate, a gentleman named Bill. He has owned shares for some 30 years. Based on the price of shares a few weeks ago and the price of those same shares in September last year, Bill has worked out that his pension will be cut by approximately $140 a week. While the actual value of the shares rose, Bill's income would not have increased at all, but he will still be penalised—and a significant penalty that will be. He has very few choices other than to give the shares to his children, sell them or accept a lower pension—and, at $140 per week less than what he normally earns, I cannot imagine that that would be a viable option.

Nevertheless, I put the case to both Ministers of a pensioner and a PAYE taxpayer who both own the same shares. The question in essence asked what effect fluctuations in shares would have on both if they bought those shares in 1990 for $5, the shares fell in value to $3 on 23 September 1992 and rose to $4 one year later. The answer I expected—and that I imagine is correct—is that, while a taxpayer would not be penalised, the pensioner would lose part of his pension due to the increase in value over the past year even though, firstly, he has not sold his shares and, secondly, if he did sell his shares, he would have made a loss.

If the value of the shares rises over the year, the pensioner loses part of his or her pension and, finally, if the pensioner sells the shares for a profit, he or she pays capital gains tax.

         —I wish to oppose the adoption of this report. The Social Security Amendment Bill is an absolute disgrace. I do not know what it would take to convince the Government that what it is doing to pensioners as a result of this legislation is disgraceful. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) has sat there through speaker after speaker and listened, I think, to reason, yet he has failed to accept our arguments. I do not know why. He has not explained in any cogent form why we should proceed with this legislation.

         The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), when he was speaking in this debate, talked about better targeting of welfare. That has really hit the bullseye here. This is aimed directly at the heart of pensioners. Those 86,000 or so pensioners of this country who have share portfolios are very concerned. We have been accused this morning of something of a beat-up in expressing our concern, but I want to assure the House that this is not a beat-up. We are speaking here because pensioners all over Australia have made their concerns known to us. They are very concerned. The speakers in this debate, which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security gagged a moment ago, I believe have been totally genuine in expressing the concerns of pensioners everywhere.

         The Parliamentary Secretary's arguments in favour of the proposition that unrealised capital gains on pensioners' share portfolios be taxed have been pathetic. The arguments that he has put forward are gross distortions. I thought this Government was big on anti-discrimination and big on fairness and equity. I want the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me what is fair about taxing unrealised capital gains. In any sense, what is fair about taxing unrealised capital gains? Why, if the Government is to tax unrealised capital gains, does it discriminate against pensioners? Why has it chosen only to tax unrealised capital gains on pensioners' shares? What is fair about that? That is discrimination. Our concern about this legislation is that it is blatantly unfair. Speaker after speaker has illustrated the effect of the Government's proposal. If that has not sunk in yet, I do not know what it will take for it to sink in. I have put the question on a number of occasions when this matter has been discussed here: how does the pensioner who loses his pension as a result of this mechanism live?

         —Yes, he sells some of his shares; that is the very point that we are making. I thank the honourable member for helping me to make it. The point is that the intention of the Government in this matter is to ensure that 86,000 pensioners in this country who have share portfolios will sell them or sell part of them.

         At least we have come to the point in this debate where the Government is prepared to be honest about that. All morning members of the Government have been getting up and distorting the truth. The Government's intention is for pensioners not to have the privilege of owning shares—a privilege which is enjoyed by every other Australian. That is the Government's intention and that will be the effect of the amendment. The reason that will be the effect of it, let me assure the House, is the same reason we are putting forward—

        1.It excludes shares and other listed securities from the definition of investment product in the Social Security Act and thereby prevents the equitable assessment of the ongoing gains made on shares and other investments listed on the Stock Exchange compared with indirect investments in shares through equity trusts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        2.The amendment will reduce the equity of the social security income test. The assessment of ongoing capital gains on shares ensures that equity of the social security system is enhanced. Pensioners with the same means and the same financial resources available to them should have the same amount of income assessed for social security purposes. People who invest in shares should not be treated more beneficially than those who invest in equity trusts or other managed investments, and they should not be treated more beneficially than those pensioners who invest in income generating investments such as bank accounts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        3.The amendment would result in the expenditure of approximately $60 million within the Social Security portfolio in a full year and a further $20 million for a full year within the Department of Veterans' Affairs portfolio on a group of clients with substantial financial resources.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.There is no reason why shares should be excluded and given privileged treatment. It is a principle of the social security income test that ongoing gains are treated as income for all investments that can be readily realised and utilised by pensioners for their support. Only those investments which are not readily realisable, such as real estate and shares held in private companies are currently exempt. Listed shares can be sold in small or large bundles at any time allowing gains on listed shares to be readily utilised by a pensioner.

        I will not speak at length on this amendment because the matters contained in it are exactly the same as those which we just debated, namely, the change in the treatment of shares, which was made law as and from December 1992.

         —I rise to speak briefly to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and the Senate amendment thereto. Interestingly enough, the Bill contains the original provisions contained when the House debated it last, including extension of benefits to the peacekeeping forces in Cambodia and Yugoslavia and adjustments to the assets test and the like. It now has attached to it an excellent proposition which effectively moves to end the Government's introduction of notional capital gains tax on pensioners.

         Much has been said about capital gains tax during the debate on the related Social Security Amendment Bill. Let me make two additional points only. Firstly, the Government's approach is a tip of the iceberg approach. It is a stab at the whole concept of notional capital gains tax once proposed by the British Labour Party and variously proposed by the Australian Labor Party in one form or another. That tip of the iceberg approach will flow on, if the Government gets away with it, to other areas of statute to the disadvantage of good tax law in Australia and what is a fair go in terms of business not actually gaining the gain but still being subjected to a form of notional capital gains tax. I believe that concept is absolutely repugnant.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, to think that pensioners, including veteran service pensioners, will somehow go scot-free if they hold shares is incorrect. I say to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca): the Government already has on the statute books its basic assets test legislation. It already has on the statute books the income test provisions, so that pensioners with a portfolio—and good luck to them if they find shares paying a sufficient dividend to trigger the income threshold—will be clobbered in terms of the service pension. It already has on the statute books the capital gains tax provisions, which means that if pensioners actually trade in shares, their service or age pension will be adjusted.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I want to say to the House in very clear-cut terms that the pensioner is already catered for. Those pensioners holding shares—and they are entitled to hold shares—who have fought for their country are now service pensioners. They might hold some shares in a range of stocks. We are about protecting their right to hold those shares and not be subjected to notional capital gains tax, that is, a notional adjustment leading to the circumstance where their pension would be reduced—and that is what notional capital gains tax is. It is for these reasons that I support the Senate's amendment to the Bill now being considered by the Committee of the Whole.

         —I want to take a couple of moments to add to some of the points raised on the Senate amendment to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. It is important to recognise that gains on shares can sometimes be illusory and based on short-term and extraneous matters rather than underlying value. One of the problems we have with this Government's proposal is that it singles out those service pensioners who seek to preserve their capital in the form of shares, as distinct from other forms of investment, such as real estate and other properties. In fact, it moves the test which at the moment excludes shares, to one that now enables—

        , the Standing Orders and practice of the House have been criticised in that restrictions similar to those applying to the form and content of questions do not apply to answers. Although it has been argued that the provision in standing order 144 which provides that questions cannot be debated should be read as meaning a prohibition of debate in answering, as well as in putting, a question, it has not been so interpreted by the Chair.

         goes on to say that the latitude permitted to Ministers has often been quite considerable in the House of Representatives. Speakers have ruled consistently that, provided an answer is relevant and is not couched in unparliamentary language, Ministers may answer questions without notice in virtually any way they choose. The interpretation of `relevant' has at times been very wide. In practice the word has been frequently accepted by the Chair as meaning relevant in some way, or relevant in part, rather than directly or completely relevant.

         records that there have been occasions when Ministers have been asked to resume their seats as their answers have not been relevant. The Chair has also held that a Minister `should not engage in irrelevancies' such as contrasting the Government and the Opposition. Past Speakers have directed a Minister so doing not to proceed, although on many other occasions such comments have been permitted.

         In view of the foregoing, I propose to allow references to subjects over which Ministers do not exercise direct control but which may impact upon their area of responsibility: for example, comments on the foreign policy of another nation, comments on the international economic situation, and references to opposition attitude where appropriate. The House itself could take some initiative in this matter. The Standing Committee on Procedure in both 1986 and 1992 made recommendations in respect of standing order 145. In 1992 the report recommended that the standing order should be amended to read:

        Passage of this recommendation would confine answers to questions more than the practice I have enunciated and which I have indicated current Standing Orders effectively oblige me to pursue.

         However, I have to say that I will be looking to Ministers to be more relevant than they have been on some occasions in the past. I would hope that the experience of the last two sitting weeks, when an average of about 14 questions was asked each day, will continue. In this regard, I intend to adopt the practice of earlier Speakers who, on a number of occasions, invited Ministers to wind up lengthy answers. By the same token, I would suggest that points of order and interjections do not encourage Ministers to wind up their answers; on the contrary, they tend to prolong the answers.

         I notice that most of the claims about the need for a rapid and radical approach have come either from the Opposition itself or from various of its diminishing cheer squad outside this place—most particularly, the renowned Des Moore of the Institute of Public Affairs. In fact, Des Moore seems to be about the only outside commentator who is proposing this rapid and radical approach. A number of other professional economists, other commentators, have actually said that it would be counterproductive for us to follow the prescriptions as proposed by Mr Moore and apparently sometimes embraced by the Opposition. The reason is that to take this radical and rapid action would be counterproductive to the requirements of economic policy at the moment.

         The Government took a very deliberate decision last year, both in the One Nation context and in the Budget, to provide a fiscal stimulus in order to promote economic recovery in this country. That process is still taking place. It was always the Government's intention, as was spelled out on both of those occasions, that following the economic stimulus provided by those measures it would be moving the deficit down to a point where it reached about one per cent of GDP by the 1996-97 financial year.

         I have already said that the prospective deficit for next year could be as high as $18 billion if no action were taken. I have also said that the deficit for next year should be around the level of that in prospect for this year. So what that means is that the Government is firmly fixed on that medium-term strategy—a strategy which has been embraced by people such as the Chief Economist for Legal and General, Mr Jolly from Syntec and even Mr Truglia from Moodys.

         The process of going towards that medium-term objective will commence in this Budget round as the Government examines both expenditure reductions and the revenue side of the Budget in order to make a credible start on the achievement of that objective. It is important to understand that Opposition members do not have a clue about any of these issues. They are confused amongst themselves and, indeed, even individual spokespersons for the Opposition are saying entirely contradictory things.

         I think the message from all this was perhaps best spelt out when the Leader of the Opposition was asked whether, in making his criticisms of the Government, he had some higher responsibility towards the national interest. Of course, he denied that he did. He said, `We tried that and it failed'. So the Opposition is now firmly into the business of irresponsible opposition, internally inconsistent opposition. It is clear from what the person asking this question has said in just the last few days. He said that we should cut expenditure on the one hand and increase expenditure on the other hand. Whilst proposing those two measures, he is suggesting that the Opposition has its own candidates for increased expenditure. When asked how to reconcile this mess—

         —I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question. Shipbuilding is an extremely important industry in Western Australia, as it is in the rest of the country. This particular industry is without doubt one of Australia's manufacturing success stories. The industry has changed since the 1970s when it was characterised by industrial unrest, high levels of government support and the production of large steel vessels for a declining international market.

         Today the industry is a major export earner, specialising in products for niche markets. Some producers are already recognised as world leaders due to their innovative approach to design and production technology. The next two years promise to be years of strong export growth coupled with increased employment for the industry. The value of vessels expected to be completed by shipbuilders this year is nearly $300 million, which is about double the industry outcome of the previous year.

         By way of contrast, the Opposition would have had that performance under considerable threat by removing any semblance of government assistance for the industry. The Government, however, believes that Australia's shipbuilders deserve at least the same level of backing from government as other Australian manufacturers get while they tackle the challenges before them. The industry's ability to successfully respond is best illustrated by the reputation for quality and performance enjoyed by companies such as Oceanfast, Austral and Wavemaster in Perth, Incat in Tasmania, and NQEA and Lloyds in Queensland.

         I am pleased to be able to advise the House that the Government will legislate to extend the bounty in line with general manufacturing tariffs from 1 July 1993. To honour the commitment made by the Prime Minister in the course of the election campaign, we will introduce the legislation into the Parliament tomorrow. The cost of this assistance—I regard it more as an investment—will be $43.8 million over four years. In order to pursue further some of the associated issues in the industry, next week I will be visiting shipyards in Western Australia—with the honourable member for Perth—and Queensland to see for myself the leading edge of this new industry.

         —Of course this discloses the absolute irresponsibility of the Leader of the Opposition, because he knows just how wrong and conceptually inaccurate this report is. He knows that, and yet he is proposing to continue to highlight these entirely inaccurate propositions. On 13 April my department was asked to comment on this report and, amongst other things, the department indicated the following to the authors of the report:

       <para font-size="-=2">

       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst to some extent the authors toned down the paragraph in question, they left the clear impression that the Commonwealth might have some difficulties in meeting its future obligations. This is untrue. The Leader of the Opposition knows it is untrue, and the authors—if they were properly qualified, if they were capable of dealing with the issues—would have known so as well.

         The responsibility for drawing together a government response to this report rests with the Minister for Finance, and I am sure that if the Leader of the Opposition were to ask him further questions about this he would be only too happy to respond. I would make this observation: the burden of this report is all about the need to disclose the Commonwealth's financial obligations—the need for disclosure. What, on this central topic, is the conclusion and recommendation of this report? This report says at recommendation 15:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The ANAO recommends that the Commonwealth continues to develop plans for the introduction of whole of government reporting on an accrual basis with a view to implementing whole of government reporting by the end of the 1994-95 financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is precisely what the Government is doing. Indeed, the Minister for Finance, in a statement he made last year,  announced that we were moving in that direction. It is one thing for the Auditor-General and his authors—in this case, Warren, Lynne, Malcolm and Susi—to draw attention to issues of importance to the public, but it should be noted that the information in this report is public information. It is drawn from public information largely available within the Budget. If the Auditor-General believes that that information should be presented in a different way, he is entitled to say so. All that the authors are saying on this occasion is that the Government should proceed with its already announced plans about the presentation of this information. In the words of the Treasury, it is neither warranted, professional nor responsible for the Auditor-General or those in his office to raise speculation that the Commonwealth is unable to meet its emerging financial obligations. This morning one of the authors was asked:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Does this mean that the Commonwealth is technically insolvent?
       </para>
       <para>
        And she said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        No, certainly not.
       </para>
       <para>
        She went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We also have not taken into account in the report the Commonwealth's power to tax, which of course should always ensure that the Commonwealth remains solvent.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is hardly an irrelevant point that the Commonwealth in every Budget makes the decision about the extent to which it will borrow, the extent to which it will pay back, and the extent to which it will balance its recurrent and future obligations. It is hardly a small point that the Commonwealth, unlike a private business, does have the power to tax and does have the power to arrange the finances of the Commonwealth as suits the economic circumstances of the time. So there are some conceptual inaccuracies in this report, and I am quite sure the Minister for Finance will be pointing out those problems and inaccuracies in the response that the Commonwealth will make to this report.

         There were changes in the same Bill to the waiting period. The ordinary waiting period will be waived for claimants of jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance and sickness allowance where the claimant has been on income support within the previous 13 weeks. Fifty-four thousand six hundred clients will be assisted by these changes. The starting date is 20 September 1993. That was rejected by the Opposition in the Senate. With the easing of the assets test withdrawal rate, the assets test for pensioners will be eased so that the pension will be reduced by $19.50 rather than $26 per year for every $250 of assets above the threshold. Mr Speaker, 48,800 pensioners and non-pensioner retirees will benefit from this change. Again, this was rejected by the Opposition in the Senate. Total winners from the legislation will be 192,400 people. This is after the Leader of the Opposition said in a press statement last week, `The fact is that the Keating Government does not give a damn about how many Australians are affected by broken promises'. He opposes things which the Government clearly said were part of its policy speech for which it sought and got a mandate at the election.

Will the Prime Minister ensure that the ethics working group of this Parliament is reconvened and that its scope is extended to include the conduct of public servants?

         —On the latter point, I am not certain whether any issue that has arisen of recent times reflects upon the conduct of public servants in terms of ethics. Be that as it may, I am quite happy to see the Parliament continue to look at the question of ethics in this cycle. Perhaps we could start by having members of the Opposition in the Senate join with the rest of the Parliament in tabling their interests, so that at least people know where they stand as a point of reference for the operation of such a regime. There are many issues involved and I know that the committee has been working on this for some time. No doubt at some appropriate time it will present its report to the Parliament.

         —The honourable member will be pleased to know that the Government will introduce legislation guaranteeing the right to unpaid parental leave, as announced during the election campaign. I notice that there have been reports in the press recently that the Government had backed away from that pledge. Whilst the matter does involve some serious and complex legal issues I am able to inform the House that these complexities have now been overcome in consultation with the acting Solicitor-General. I can now advise the House that such legislation can be based on the external affairs powers of the Australian Constitution. This will give effect to Australia's obligation as a party to ILO convention 156 ratified by Australia on 30 March 1990.

         Parental leave allows a parent to leave the work force after the birth of a child to care for the child without having to resign from the parent's job. The ILO convention requires government to take measures so that the needs of workers who have family responsibilities are properly taken into account in their terms and conditions of employment. The convention also requires, I am able to inform the House, governments to take measures to enable those workers to re-enter the labour force after an absence caused by their family responsibilities. The legislation guaranteeing parental leave will therefore be a very important part of the Government's comprehensive strategy for implementing its ILO obligations.

Under the package we expected that by the end of this year some 96,300 places in a mixture of programs will be provided for young people and we are well on track in achieving that target. There are some notable features of it that are worth the consideration of the House, particularly in the area of apprentices and trainees. There has been a rise of some 16 per cent in apprenticeships in the period July 1992 to March 1993 above the equivalent period the year before. In the case of traineeships for the same period there has been a lift of some 94 per cent over the previous period. So almost 17,500 unemployed apprentices and apprentices at risk of losing their jobs have been helped through special assistance measures.

In the youth career and information advice program we have had some 60,000 young people take advantage of opportunities for career advice. Some 3,000 students and over 1,600 trainees have now signed up in some 100 pilot programs associated with the new vocational certificate program.

It was quite happy to let the P&amp;Os of this world run the place with a spare pool of labour that belonged to no-one in particular but cost everyone in general, and it was quite happy for this to be a dead hand upon Australia. But all of a sudden when this Government arrived it was all our job to fix. Of course, largely fix it we have, with a turnaround time now for containers in Sydney comparable to ports such as Rotterdam, a 50 per cent decline in the number of people in the waterfront in the last 12 months, and now OECD levels on crew manning on Australian ships that have fallen from around 30 crew per vessel to 21 and heading for 19. The problem of uncompetitive shipping services has been repaired at source by dealing with the structure of the manning of Australian line vessels, and the result is that they are eminently more competitive.

They sat there with this clogged up waterfront, with a pool of labour which was not even company hired, which had loyalties to no-one in particular and was a general cost to the whole waterfront. They saw the stevedoring companies and the unions play off the shippers like a break, and what did they do about all those years when the honourable member for Bennelong was Treasurer or, dare I say it, when the Leader of the Opposition was his adviser? Did we ever see any changes from them ? No, it took a bit of ticker, a little bit of intellect—in short, a bit of courage—to do something about it.

Apparently the Leader of the National Party supports that sort of behaviour. That is why the President of the RSL has become the Alf Garnett of the RSL and why he is held generally, I think, in very low esteem by the RSL community.

         When Mr Garland came to see me not long after I became Prime Minister and we had the celebrations of the various commemorative events during 1992, after 50 years—the fall of Singapore, the battle of Kokoda, et cetera—one of his requests to me was to pay for him to visit the United Kingdom to go to some ceremony that he said was important to him. The fact is that Mr Garland comes from that area of the RSL where people think the only place you can really hold your head up high is walking down Whitehall—and I have made that very clear to him every time I have seen him.

         —The issue of potential for exports in relation to the housing industry is a very important one for this Parliament. Progress on the Government's housing export strategy is proceeding strongly on a number of fronts, including support for Australia's early involvement in a $1 billion World Bank housing project in China, which could have very important spin-offs for Australian industry.

         The Government is also considering the proposed establishment of an industry-government joint venture facility in Jakarta, Indonesia, to market Australian building product systems technology and training. The fast growing economies of Asia provide significant market opportunity for housing and related industries to take advantage of higher disposable incomes and a greater demand which is occurring for quality housing.

         Our housing industry is very efficient. It is highly skilled but its strong domestic performance simply has not been reflected internationally. The housing industry in Australia represents of the order of five per cent of GDP and yet a very small proportion of its product is exported overseas. If one took comparable European countries, the percentage of their domestic activity which results in export is of the order of 40 per cent—not a very minor percentage as is true in Australia. We want to work in partnership with industry to change that situation.

         Some Australian firms are already directly involved in a range of overseas projects. For example, apartment complexes in Thailand and Malaysia, a plasterboard factory in Indonesia and even the export of bricks and pavers to Japan. In addition, Vietnam wants to develop a national building code based on the building code of Australia, while the Bangkok metropolitan administration is interested in Australian assessments in the development of their building regulations.

         To realise these opportunities, clearly a national strategic approach is required which will draw on the expertise of industry, help companies to grasp early market opportunities, coordinate export activities, better assess the market environments, and promote an understanding of the essentials of success in exporting. I am hoping to announce the details of Australia's export strategy in relation to housing in August. It is important that we take this very significant, quite efficient Australian industry and turn it into an export industry as part of a broader approach to the region, where Australia's experience in housing and urban development can translate into very significant export dollars.

        —Mr Speaker, I wish to raise a matter of privilege. Today the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) read from a letter which was sent to the Auditor-General, presumably with the Treasurer's authority, in regard to a report on government debt prepared by the Auditor-General for this Parliament. The Treasurer further claimed that as a result of this letter certain changes by way of moderation of this report to parliament were achieved. The Auditor-General reports, by legislation, directly to this Parliament, for the clear and proper reason: to prevent the executive government interfering in any way with such reports. It is my view that any attempt, particularly by the executive government, to interfere with such reporting must represent a breach of parliamentary privilege.

That is crystal clear in this report—if the honourable member for O'Connor had bothered to read it—because it includes the comments `received back by the Auditor-General'.

         —by leave—My purpose in making this statement is to provide the House with information on the Government's responses to the outcomes of the Earth Summit, or the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which was held in June 1992. The centrepiece documents of the summit—the UN conventions on climate change and biological diversity, a statement of forest principles and the action plan, agenda 21—are only the first steps in a process which we all acknowledge will occupy the global community well into the next century. Nevertheless, they are crucial and historic steps. They involve commitment to the environment and to the needs and welfare of people. They involve challenges and opportunities for all countries. These international developments are paving the way to a sustainable future. Just as important for Australians is the commitment of this Government to our national environment.

         The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) recently made two important statements on the environment—on 21 December 1992 and 9 March 1993—which refocused our vision and our energies on the fundamental problems in the Australian environment, and on the results we can obtain through cooperation. He said:

         Let me start by outlining the action we have already taken in Australia to give effect to the two conventions and to agenda 21. Along with 153 other countries, we signed the climate change convention in Rio. Although called a framework convention, indicating that there is much left to negotiate and agree, the climate change convention represents the end of a phase of global consensus building and education on the rationale and need for action on greenhouse gas emissions.

         The convention will enter into force and become legally binding on parties 90 days after it has been ratified by 50 countries. Australia ratified the convention in December 1992 and is one of 19 countries so far to have done so. Our expectation is that the convention will achieve the necessary 50 ratifications in 1994.

         Australia played an active and significant role in the development of and negotiations on the convention. I, in collaboration with the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), have responsibility for further developing Australia's approach to the convention, bearing in mind the particular Australian interests arising from our fossil fuel dependency and unique natural environment. We will continue to participate actively in the further development of the convention and in the bodies set up to guide its implementation. In doing so, we shall draw upon emerging scientific information on climate change and its impacts.

         The first conference of parties is expected to be held early in 1995. In this phase of negotiations, leading up to the first conference of parties, Australia sees as the immediate priority the need to identify and gain agreement to mechanisms to implement the commitments currently contained in the convention. Some of the implementation details still to be decided include issues of significant importance to Australia.

         Within Australia, the Commonwealth Government, working with the States and local government, has already put in place the mechanisms necessary to give effect to our convention obligations.

         The first phase of the national greenhouse response strategy was endorsed by heads of government in December. That first phase concentrates on `no regrets' measures—in other words, those measures that have net benefits, or at least no net cost, in addition to addressing the greenhouse effect, and that are therefore worth doing in their own right. These include: improving the efficiency of energy production and use; diversifying our sources of energy; developing sustainable and greenhouse effective agricultural practices; improving our national transport system; better urban planning; natural environment conservation; research into climate change; and community information and education.

         The national greenhouse response strategy is based on the Australian interim planning target on greenhouse gas emissions which we adopted in 1990, and which the Prime Minister reaffirmed in his environment statement in December 1992. Our target aims to stabilise emissions of greenhouse gases, based on 1988 levels, by the year 2000 and to reduce these emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2005.

         The Government also holds to its decision that, while recognising the need to restrict greenhouse gas emissions, Australia will not proceed with the adoption of response measures which would have net adverse economic impacts nationally or on Australia's trade competitiveness, in the absence of similar action by major greenhouse gas producing countries. In that context I note the announcement by US President Clinton on 21 April that the US would be adopting a policy to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions. This means that all OECD countries, with the exception of Turkey, have now adopted national greenhouse gas emission targets.

         We have already transmitted to the climate change convention negotiators Australia's interim report on the measures we have taken consistent with the convention. For this purpose the national greenhouse response strategy formed Australia's interim report. I am pleased to report that last Saturday the environment Ministers of all Australian governments, State and Commonwealth together, endorsed a work program to implement a range of measures contained in the national greenhouse response strategy. I understand that similar work plans are being developed and implemented by a range of agencies and bodies responsible for making the first phase of the strategy a success.

         The challenges and opportunities presented by greenhouse-induced climate change are real and highly significant for Australia, as they are for the entire global community. I do not underestimate the adjustment issues we are facing. The very public debate that has occurred over the last few years is evidence of the valid concerns and different viewpoints about the amount and speed of adjustment needed. The Government's policies explicitly recognise these adjustment issues. And I believe that with genuine cooperation and goodwill on all sides, and with acknowledgment of others' interests, the challenges can indeed be met.

         There are also significant opportunities.

         There is a similar story to tell for the biodiversity convention. The biodiversity convention recognises the global imperative in the conservation and sustainable use of species, genetic resources and ecosystems for the benefit of present and future generations. It too was signed in Rio by over 150 countries. Again, Australia played a leading role in the development of the convention and is continuing to play a key role in its implementation both internationally and, more specifically, in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia considers it vital to maintain the impetus for the convention's early entry into force and implementation and I am encouraging other countries to take action in this regard.

         I view the strategy as a key element for implementing the Government's environment policy. It will be available for consideration by governments within the next few months and will hopefully be adopted by the end of this year. The strategy will provide an effective framework, involving all sectors of the community, for achieving biological conservation goals. It proposes a mix of short- and long-term actions on conservation, sustainable use, the management of threats, improving knowledge and community involvement. The strategy and the subsequent program will be two of the major measures for implementing our obligations under the convention. They will strengthen and add to the wide range of current Commonwealth programs in the area of nature conservation and biological protection.

         Australia is in a unique position. We are the only developed country which is also megadiverse. Many of our primary industries, essential to our export earnings, are dependent either directly or indirectly on our biological diversity and that of other countries. It is therefore in Australia's interests, environmental and economic, to take strong and decisive actions to conserve biological diversity and to maximise the benefits to be gained. Australia's leadership in this field creates opportunities. Not only are we maximising the benefits to be gained from a well-managed and conserved natural heritage, but the commercial opportunities are also highly significant. Australia possesses significant expertise, in both the private and public sectors, in biological research, assessment and management, as well as in associated and enabling techniques and technologies, such as remote sensing. The potential benefits of using our own genetic resources in areas of science, medicine and agriculture are enormous.

         I turn now to the Earth Summit's action plan for sustainable development in the 21st century—agenda 21. Agenda 21 is a truly massive document—40 chapters covering matters as diverse as poverty, population, technology transfer, consumption patterns, forests, freshwater, pollution avoidance, transboundary air pollution, and radioactive waste. It is a blueprint or set of guidelines, not just for individual countries but, importantly, for the entire United Nations system as well as for individuals and organisations of every size and type. Australia contributed significantly to its preparation and negotiations. The adoption of agenda 21 at the Rio summit marks an important step in global cooperation on environment and development matters. While agenda 21 does not impose binding legal commitments on governments, we will be doing our best to ensure that it is adopted in Australia, provided of course that individual activities proposed accord with our domestic economic interests and international priorities for sustainable development.

         Essentially the process for implementing agenda 21 will be one of analysing the recommendations, assessing their relevance and applicability to Australia and ensuring that the high priority recommendations are being acted upon through existing programs and institutions. The recommendations of agenda 21 cover a wide range of issues and responsibilities for implementation, cutting across virtually every Commonwealth and State government agency as well as local government and the non-government sector. It will be necessary to ensure that all of these parties have input to the process. My department has the responsibility for the overall coordination of the domestic follow-up of agenda 21, although other agencies will have a more direct implementation task. It is not envisaged that a major new process will be required on the part of Australia to implement agenda 21. There are already a number of processes and mechanisms which will make a major contribution to its implementation.

         Chief among them will be the consultative arrangements established under the 1992 intergovernmental agreement on the environment and the processes under the Government's ecologically sustainable development policy, which brought together government, industry, unions and broad based community representatives to report on the policies and structures necessary to achieve ESD in Australia. The preparation of national sustainable development strategies or plans is a key recommendation of agenda 21 and I believe Australia's own ESD strategy is already being seen as something of a model. During my visit to Washington, for example, I found keen interest in our experience amongst the members of the Administration I spoke with.

         A key feature of this Government's approach to the development of policies on international environment and sustainable development issues has been community consultation. Following the Earth Summit and the conclusion of the two conventions we recognised that past practices and methods would need to be upgraded and given new life. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have decided to formalise and enhance a process to receive the views of the non-government community on these very important international environment issues. An international environment non-government organisations consultative forum has now been established and will meet for the first time on Friday this week. Its 17 members comprise senior representatives of business, environment, aid and community groups. I am pleased to announce that the forum will be chaired by our friend and colleague the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), who brings to the position a unique blend of personal experience and commitment. His task will be a challenging one and one which Senator Evans and I very much value and appreciate.

         Our efforts to give effect to the international obligations arising from the two conventions and the imperatives of agenda 21 are closely linked to the many other domestic environment initiatives and policies of this Government, in particular, the initiatives announced through both the Prime Minister's December 1992 environment statement and the March 1993 election statement on the environment. Both statements recognise the important, indeed essential, part the environment has to play in Australia's growth.

         The initiatives revolve around the key role of ecologically sustainable development, recognising as they do the need to conserve and preserve our stock and use the income wisely for future generations, rather than depleting our assets for short-term gain. Examples such as the acquisition of the Calperum pastoral lease, feral animal and weed control, the cleaner production demonstration program, a national halon bank and national state of the environment reporting show that this Government will not be slow in taking the necessary environmental decisions where they are central to the issue of Australia's development as a nation.

         One of the key outcomes of the summit was its recognition of the need to build international partnerships for sustainable development, partnerships between developed and developing countries and between the developing countries themselves. Of course, well before UNCED Australia was focusing attention on our immediate region. The summit and the processes leading up to it gave a considerable boost to the environmental dimension of that relationship.

          The key player in starting the follow-up to UNCED was the UN General Assembly. At its 1992 session, the General Assembly examined the UNCED outcomes and established certain directions and priorities. The General Assembly welcomed the finalisation of the conventions and urged countries which had not signed them in Rio to do so soon. The General Assembly also urged ratification and a prompt start to both the climate change and biological diversity conventions.

         The General Assembly then looked at agenda 21 as the principle action document from UNCED and identified a number of issues or recommendations requiring immediate action. It took action to establish a commission for sustainable development as a senior body within the UN system. The establishment of the commission was a centrepiece of agenda 21. The commission has been formally established and will now meet annually in June. The main role of the commission will be to monitor the implementation of agenda 21. Countries are expected to provide reports on their own efforts and the operational agencies of the UN system, such as the UN development program, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the UN environment program, as well as organisations such as the World Bank, will be reporting to the commission on their own efforts to give effect to the recommendations of agenda 21.

         The other key elements in the General Assembly's decisions on UNCED related to the immediate establishment of three important international processes which could not wait until the commission was established and operating. Those processes were: firstly, the establishment of a special intergovernmental negotiating committee to develop an international convention on desertification. The primary focus of the negotiations is to achieve international consensus on the measures needed to deal with the problems of land degradation in those countries experiencing drought and/or desertification, particularly in Africa.

         Secondly, the General Assembly also established a special conference to deal with problems of management of high seas fisheries, notably the problems of managing the exploitation of highly migratory species and species which straddle the 200-mile exclusive economic zones of coastal states. A third process was also a conference on the particular problems of small island states.

         Apart from the UN, there are a few other key players worthy of mention, in particular the global environment facility. The GEF, as it is called, is a joint project of the World Bank, UNEP and UNDP and was established in 1990 with around $US1.5 billion of donor funds specifically to help developing countries undertake projects to deal with global environmental issues. The GEF is already performing an interim role for the conventions by funding activities such as the country biodiversity studies and the greenhouse gas inventories as well as providing funds for large-scale conservation and energy efficiency or conversion programs in developing countries. The GEF will be reformed and replenished this year so that it is capable of taking on the extra roles allocated to it once the conventions come into force.

At the conclusion of this conference, most of the nations of the world signed the Rio declaration, which is a commitment to a set of principles requiring development to be sensitive to the environment. The Earth Summit also endorsed agenda 21, a wide-ranging program of national and international actions to be taken by its principals into the 21st century. During the summit, Australia signed the conventions on climate change and biological diversity. In her speech today, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) addressed the responses the Government has taken to give effect to these two conventions and to agenda 21.

The climate change convention, which 153 countries signed, is an agreement to act together with all other nations to reduce the production of greenhouse gases. The coalition strongly supports the signing of this convention and its aims.

         In her speech the Minister said that the Labor Government has already put in place the mechanisms necessary to give effect to the national greenhouse response strategy. In this regard the Government's actions do not always match its rhetoric. In October 1990 as an interim response to the threat of global warming the Government announced an energy efficiency package which could be implemented immediately to save on energy use in Australia. However, in a report tabled in Parliament on 18 May this year, the Australian National Audit Office concluded that in regard to the 1990 announcement insufficient implementary action had been taken. In particular, the Government's own operations had failed to set an example. I would like to quote from the report of the Australian National Audit Office:

The report went on to say that manufacturing industry had been neglected, although there was scope to greatly expand understanding of energy use in the home, in transport and in commercial buildings, and also there was a lack of coordination on energy ratings and standards for appliances and buildings. I think an important point to make is that it is very nice to have all these strategies but when we give departments the job of implementing the strategies something has to be done, and it has to be done reasonably quickly.

         The Minister is inclined to make statements about Australia's lead on environmental issues including greenhouse. The truth is that per person Australia sends more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than any other Western country. At 11 tonnes per person, Australia emits more greenhouse gases per person per annum than the United States at 10 tonnes and three times as much as Japan with three tonnes. I think most Australians would be somewhat stunned to note that.

Acknowledging the dependence of Australia on energy intensive industries, we still cannot take the state of our greenhouse emissions lightly, and I would ask the Minister to address this problem as a matter of urgency.

The extension of national parks and world heritage areas are all very well but of little use if these parks and world heritage areas are ravaged by feral foxes, rabbits, goats, pigs, cats and brumbies. We would also welcome a statement from the Minister on sustainable agriculture.

         The coalition hopes that opportunities are provided to business and industry groups to participate extensively in the finalisation of the biodiversity strategy.

I shall return to community consultation later in agenda 21.

         I turn now to the Minister's statements on agenda 21. The Minister is confident that the Government can meet the obligations that agenda 21 places on Australia through the arrangements established under the 1992 intergovernmental agreement on the environment. By abolishing the cabinet committee on sustainable development, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has cast some doubt on the genuineness of his commitment to the ESD process. The Minister indicated that she believed Australia's only ESD strategy is already seen as something of a model in implementing the recommendations of agenda 21.

Whether you look at the current account, the foreign debt, the Budget deficit or the Government's financial obligations, it is clear that this is a government driven by debt. It is a debt driven government. The tragedy of Australia is that the legacy of 10 years of Keating mismanagement is that Australia is haunted by debt.

         was tabled in the Senate. It has been tabled today in the House. The Auditor-General has savaged this Government, its reporting mechanism, its accountability and the way in which the Government reports to the Parliament and to the taxpayers. The Auditor-General has found that the Government has entered obligations of around $125 billion and has set aside only about $57 billion of liquid assets to meet them. The report says that the figure is known to be understated. The question is by how much. How much has this Government run up on the Bankcard? How much will future generations of Australians have to pay for the Government's mismanagement? Who will pay the piper, as the Auditor-General says?

There was the current account figure in March of $2.1 billion. If the IMF is beginning to knock on doors in Canada, we hear an eerie silence in Australia.

         Then there is the Budget deficit. When the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) came to that portfolio he inherited a surplus of $8 billion. Over the three years of the last Parliament he turned that around to a $16 billion deficit, the largest in Australian history. Even if he brings in all the projections, between 1991 and 1997 he will run up a deficit of about $80 billion. In the last financial year, this Government was overspending on revenue—that is, spending more than it raised—by about $45 million a day. Over that six-year period the Government will rack up a deficit of about $80 billion, comparable only to the Whitlam period.

The Government is trying to soften up the Australian public for new taxes. It cannot honour its promises, it cannot get its deficits under control, and it is trying to soften up Australians for new taxes.

It should read them well, because the Australian public are not going to be benign on this Government when it goes into higher taxes. Let us make it absolutely clear that there is only one reason for higher taxes: if the Government will not cut its own spending, it will have to cut the taxpayers' spending. It is going to cut the taxpayers' spending by taking taxes out of taxpayers' pockets so that they cannot spend. This Government will not control its own spending, and so it intends to cut the spending of the Australian taxpayers.

        Then the Auditor-General went on to talk about accountability and the information that has to be given to this Parliament to get that kind of accountability. He went on to say that the information—which the Government does not have—would be essential for good management of a company. If the Government were running a company it would have to do better than this. This Government has a Bill before the Parliament to ensure that companies engage in continuous financial disclosure. But, even on an annual budgetary basis, the Government cannot disclose liabilities in superannuation. What hypocrites! How can the Government possibly lecture Australian business on the need for continuous financial disclosure when it is not even disclosing on an annual basis the information that its auditor requires to make an assessment.

It is all the fault of our auditor.'? If a company director behaved like that he would probably find himself in a court of law. Yet that is exactly what this Government is doing. It is standing up and saying, `We can't give you the information that would even be required in the management of a good company, but let's tell you all about our auditor. He's unprofessional. Don't take any notice of him. He's belled the cat. He's disclosed the financial situation. We don't like people like that. We stand up in parliament and we attack people like that.

         Let us also make this clear: the Auditor-General did not say that Australia was insolvent; he said it would be insolvent if it were not for the power to tax. We know that the Government can solve its solvency problems by expropriating the property of taxpayers. We know that. The Government has this unique ability when it gets into financial situations to take money from others to rectify the problem.

But the worst feature of those roads that are leading to tax is that they are not just the taxes of today's citizens, they are not just today's taxes, because, as the Auditor-General makes entirely clear, this Government is engaged in an intergenerational transfer. It has not set aside the money today for the liabilities of today. It will have to get those taxes from future generations of Australians. Future generations of Australians under the `Let the children pay policy' will be given a legacy of debt and obligation. As if it were not bad enough to run debts on this generation of voters, this Government has decided to financially abuse the next one as well.

         for December 1992 published general government net debt for 18 OECD countries. It lists them in groups of high debt countries, medium debt countries and low debt countries. The high debt countries are Belgium, Italy, Ireland and Greece, with a range of government debt to GDP of 124 per cent to 82 per cent. The medium debt countries are Netherlands, Canada, Austria, United States, Spain and the United Kingdom, with a range of government debt to GDP of 60 per cent to 36 per cent. The low debt countries are Denmark at 29 per cent, France at 29 per cent, Germany at 23 per cent and Australia at 15.8 per cent. There are four countries below us: Finland, Japan, Sweden and Norway.

         Those opposite should not give us this absolute garbage about our being financially irresponsible. This Government has a relatively low level of debt compared with that of most other OECD Western developed countries and, financially, it has behaved very responsibly in its period in office. Of course there has been an increase in the deficit in recent times and that has meant an increase in debt. But that has been the experience of every Western country in the last few years. There has been an international economic recession which has meant that all governments have suffered losses of tax revenue and increases in government expenditure, particularly on unemployment benefits. Therefore, most countries have run up bigger budget deficits and a couple have reduced surpluses. The budgetary situations in all of those countries have deteriorated in recent times. There is nothing unique about Australia's experience in that regard. It is what happens when the economic cycle turns down.

         We have added to that a little by our efforts to stimulate the economy, and various other countries have done exactly the same thing. Even the United Kingdom Conservative Government had a massive change in its budget outcome from a budget surplus to a deficit of about six per cent of GDP. That is well above ours as a proportion of GDP. That Government has done that largely because of the automatic blow-out of the budget due to recession and also due to the action it has taken to try to stimulate the economy. This is happening in just about all of the Western countries. So this absurd notion that Australia is somehow uniquely suffering some increase in its deficit and that the Government is therefore culpable in the extreme and is laying a terrible burden on future generations is just total garbage.

         I return to the Auditor-General's report. Essentially, it says that the Government needs to make some changes to government accounting procedures so as to provide a full view of the Government's true financial position. We accept that it is desirable to do that. In fact, we have already adopted the major reforms needed to bring that about—that is, a move to a system of accrual accounting. It is already happening. It happens in most of the GBEs and government authorities. I said last year that we were going to introduce it as from 1994-95 in reports of all government departments. Once we move to an accrual system all the departments will give a full assessment of assets and liabilities—I stress the assets as well as the liabilities; assets are remarkably lacking in this analysis—and then we will have full accounting, department by department, of their overall balances.

         Putting all that together, along with the GBEs and authorities—most of which have already moved to accrual accounting—we can get whole of government reporting. Research is already going on to see what is involved in bringing all of that together to get whole of government accounting happening in a proper way. If that research comes up with the right result, we may well be able to move, as the Auditor-General would like, to a whole of government reporting process by 1995. That will be fine; we have no problems with that whatever. In fact, virtually all the information that the Auditor-General says is lacking at the present time will come to light through the move to accrual accounting. We have no problem with that point. That is not to say that all of the recommendations are acceptable; they are not, and I will come to a couple of those.

         While it has been in office the Government has made various improvements to its financial management so as to provide more information to the public. Before we came to office there were no forward estimates of outlays showing what expenditures would be, department by department, for the Budget year plus three more years; that did not exist. We publish those outlays in the Budget papers each year so that the people of Australia are aware of where all of those outlays for program expenditures are going.

         The assessment of superannuation liability is also something that has been produced consistently since we have been in office. It was first produced in 1982, before we came into office, but we have updated it regularly since. So the amount of unfunded superannuation liability is something which comes to light every few years. We have a three-year cycle, which has become a five-year cycle at the moment because of the big changes that were made to government superannuation in 1990. The introduction of the public sector superannuation scheme and the changes to invalidity requirements meant that there was a considerable cut in the costs of public sector superannuation and until that new scheme settles down it is appropriate to delay the recalculation of the unfunded liability. But that will take place next year and then be on a three-year cycle. So we will continually have the actuary doing that update and providing that information. It is not a matter of hiding information. We have produced it several times since we have been in office and we will continue to do so.

         This report does have a number of deficiencies. While seeking to assess total financial obligations, it does not take full account of the Government's assets or indeed some revenues that are legally to flow to the Government. The report refers only to available liquid assets of $57 billion. It says, `Here are all these obligations'—some of them involve expenditures going out 30 or 40 years—`but you have got only $57 billion in the bank to pay for it'. These are expenditures which can be 40 years away. It is stupid to compare cash assets with liabilities going out in 30 or 40 years time. Of course, what we need is full accounting. That will involve government assets being brought into the picture—and that will be possible with accrual accounting—and also bringing in revenue, which is not done in this report. That is revenue which is legally obliged to be paid to the Government.

         I have mentioned international comparisons, which are patently lacking in the Auditor-General's report. The report also implies that Budget deficits that go beyond the expenditure on infrastructure are inappropriate because they impose a burden on future generations. It seems to say that the whole countercyclical approach of fiscal policy is wrong. That seems to be a terribly narrow accounting based approach to the role of government in terms of budgetary policy. Budgetary policy is not just about each year producing a balanced book, but also about making sure that the economy runs as well as it possibly can. That means that at times there will be Budget deficits and at times, hopefully, Budget surpluses according to the economic cycle. It does not mean a rigid adherence to Budget outcomes which are balanced or near to.

         In relation to superannuation, the Auditor-General suggests a number of things. Firstly, he says that there is a $40 billion unfunded obligation, but there is no reference to the fact that the Government changed the scheme in 1990 and in doing so reduced unfunded liabilities when it did so by $5 billion and new entrants costs by one-third. There was no mention of that and that is a deficiency in the report. There is no recognition of the clawback saving resulting from tax payable on superannuation paid, and there are reduced pension payouts because people are on superannuation and not on pensions. In fact, on our best estimate that clawback cuts the cost by $19 billion of that $40 billion. Almost half the costs are saved by the clawback which gets no mention whatever in this report.

         It is also the case that the Government is not a private or a public company and therefore it will not go broke. The security problem relating to the need for funded superannuation in companies so that people can be sure that they have their retirement benefits when they retire is not an issue for a government which will be in place for the long term. People can have unfunded liability knowing that they will be able to get their retirement benefits when they are due. This report has a lot of shortcomings, but the basic recommendations are generally acceptable.

The reality is that today during Question Time the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) delivered a most disgraceful attack on the Auditor-General of this country.

If they do not pay it by 30 June they will lose tax deductibility in this financial year. Then they have until 14 August, and if they are one day late they not only lose tax deductibility altogether but also have interest imposed on them straight away.

We can go a step further and say that the Auditor-General's report is framed in the most narrow accounting terms.

Indeed, the coverage of the Auditor-General's report in today's newspapers similarly misrepresents many of the constructive points and overstates some of the criticisms that are contained in the report. As far as I can see, that is really the problem in this debate: not enough regard has been given to the positive steps which have been taken.

         I turn first to the area of accrual accounting. The Auditor-General's report makes some worthwhile recommendations in this area, but it fails to give credit to the Government's recent initiatives. It fails to recognise that the Minister for Finance has taken major steps in this area. For example, some 35 government departments have volunteered to take part in a pilot program to produce financial statements on an accrual basis in 1992-93.

         There are several reasons why the Government has moved to accrual accounting arrangements: to identify the cost of government programs; provide cost control and efficiency methods; improve asset management; assist in determining pricing policies for user charging; monitor increased productivity; enhance accountability; and so on. We did not have to wait for the Auditor-General to produce this report before addressing these matters. These steps have been put in place by the Minister for Finance and the Government for a significant time. This report does not give adequate weight to those sorts of issues.

         The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) spoke about the level of deficit, obligations issues and so on. The Auditor-General's report is notable for not clearly defining the cyclical issues relating to the economy, the deficit and the obligations that might flow from that and the more significant structural issues.

         Looking at the deficit, what really matters is the capacity of the Government to manage the economy over time. The Auditor-General's report suggests that a long-term view should be taken about the management of the economy in the same way that a private company would develop its arrangements. Analysing what the Government has done through the 1980s and early 1990s, that is the sort of management the Government has regarded as important. The Government did plan Budget surpluses throughout the growth period of the late 1980s and has recognised that present cyclical conditions mean that we have to move into deficit to regain stimulus and growth in the economy.

         The honourable member for Cowper suggested an alternative strategy which, he says, is implied in the report. The alternative to having stimulus when the economy is recessed is to prolong that recession to make it more difficult to get the necessary growth in the economy, which creates hardship for the people the honourable member spoke about.

         The Government, quite rightly in my view, has said that it will get the Budget balanced over time rather than adopt the knee-jerk reaction that some appear to advocate; that is, it can all be achieved in one Budget. Clearly, a three- to four-year strategy needs to be developed to get the Budget balanced. It cannot be achieved overnight. The net effect of trying to achieve that overnight would be to create more economic mayhem.

         What would be the result of that mayhem? All that would happen is that revenue would fall and more government expenditure would be needed to meet those liabilities. That is the big problem with this report. The clear implication of a recession, such as the one we have now, is that revenues fall because less tax is paid, more unemployment benefits are paid and so on. That is precisely why the Government has acted in the way it has to create the necessary economic stimulus.

         The other aspect of why this report is so narrow can best be illustrated by the way in which a household budget is dealt with. Working on the sorts of presumptions contained in the Auditor-General's report, it suggests that a household can fully meet every one of its obligations at a given point, even though the house mortgage is planned to be paid over 15 to 20 years. Not one household in the country would plan its decision making on that basis and, quite frankly, nor would we expect it to. Yet it appears from the report that major public infrastructure should be accounted for and the Government should be meeting its superannuation commitment. That assumes that the complete liability for superannuation will fall due tomorrow, which is most unlikely and is quite narrow in context anyway. It also assumes that the Government is not moving towards meeting its ongoing superannuation commitments. Both of those assumptions are wrong.

         The Opposition's approach to all these issues has been interesting. In the last three years of the Parliament, what sorts of things did the Opposition say would occur? It said there would be a double-dip recession. It was wrong on that one. It said we would have a run on the dollar. It has been wrong on that one. It said interest rates would be going up repeatedly through all that process, yet we have interest rates at the lowest level in 25 years. So it was wrong on that one.

         The Opposition has gone on to make other sorts of similarly erroneous claims as to what the Government was going to do to the economy. It has referred constantly to the fact that the growth in the economy was not going to be sustained. Clearly, the Government is determined to make sure that growth is sustained. One of the mechanisms to make sure that growth is sustained is to have responsible Budget processes over a period of years, with a medium-term strategy that demonstrates how we overcome the economic difficulties we have in Australia but at the same time recognises that Australia's position, as compared with that of countries that we deal with, is certainly responsible and sound. Indeed, the auditor's report effectively demonstrates the soundness of our economy and makes the point—not as strongly as it should be made—that the revenue side also has to be taken into account in these sorts of issues. It has not been, as far as the actual report documentation is concerned.

         —The Opposition has been hoist with its own petard absolutely magnificently, and it is writhing in embarrassment at what it confronts with this particular matter. Far be it for the Opposition's spokesman on social security, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), to wander into this place and say that the Government trades on the vulnerability of the unemployed and the pensioners, because that is exactly what the smart alecs in the Opposition in the Senate intended to trade on in this regard. What they have done, of course, is to compromise the honour of the Opposition very thoroughly—compromise it on the point of a Budget measure put in by the Government in 1992 to oppose that—

         —A load of rubbish, is it, for the honourable member for O'Connor? What does he think the implications are for people who are seeking unemployment benefits when the proposition here is effectively for those to be brought on more quickly, when those opposite are looking for $900 million worth of savings off it? Those opposite went into the last election campaign looking for $900 million worth of savings out of the unemployed. These propositions will involve increased outlays in relation to people who are associated with the unemployed. So do not try to hide behind some sort of facade—

         —I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, and in particular on the amendment made to the Bill in the Senate. I take every opportunity to speak on veterans affairs in this Parliament; I have a direct interest in the matter and, in some respects, one could almost construe a financial interest. However, I believe that I have a responsibility to veterans to speak at every opportunity.

         As the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) said earlier, this Bill has been supported by the Opposition and to a very great extent it still has our support. We support the changes that the Government proposed to the assets test. We strongly support the changes to the definitions covering service in Cambodia, in the former Yugoslavia, and the peacekeeping service in Somalia, effectively granting additional benefits to Australian servicemen who served and continue to serve with distinction in the areas which have now been determined to be operational areas. With the elections going on in Cambodia at the present time, I observe in passing that the United Nations contingent in that country is commanded by an Australian, Lt Gen. Sanderson. The troops under his command have performed with distinction, and of course a substantial number of those troops are Australians.

         However, the Opposition remains implacably opposed to the Government's proposal to treat unrealised capital gains on veteran pensioners' shareholdings as income. We debated this matter at length this morning in the context of the Social Security Amendment Bill. The Government is treating the proposal in the context of this legislation exactly as it treated it in the context of the other legislation this morning. In effect, we are being blackmailed—I do not use the word lightly—into ultimately supporting something to which we are strongly opposed.

         I do not think that I will change the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) on this point tonight, because we argued about it all morning. It seems that the Government has made up its mind to proceed to tax unrealised capital gains on pensioners' shareholdings.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We were informed this morning that 60,000 social security pensioners are affected by that legislation. In the context of this Bill, 24,000 veterans are affected by the proposal—and that concerns me greatly.

         Although the matter was argued at length this morning, I do want to reiterate that we are opposed to the measure because it is unfair and it is totally unreasonable for the Government to have proceeded in that direction. Veterans are very special people. Many of them are now aged and, by and large, it is the aged veterans—veterans in receipt of a pension—who will be affected by this particular proposal. As I said, there are 24,000 of them, and almost all will be adversely affected.

         I do not expect that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to answer the question any more clearly tonight than he did this morning, but I put it again: does the Government realise that the practical implication of this proposal is that people will be asked to live on less money than they have now? There is no way around that unless, as the Parliamentary Secretary admitted, they sell their shares or part of their shareholding. That is the despicable aspect of this part of the legislation: that we should say to certain people—aged people; in this case the 24,000 veteran pensioners—that they can no longer hold shares; that they no longer have the right that every other Australian has to own shares in a public company.

         I also posed the question of how far the Government is prepared to go in seeking equity, as the Government calls it. When, for instance, will it start to value their homes each year, or their cars? When does it move on to shares in private companies? The Parliamentary Secretary has already told us that they are not so marketable. Surely homes are marketable, in a sense, although they are not traded on the stock exchange. The principle of this proposal is so appallingly wrong that I cannot understand how the Government can argue for it.

         I am proud to be a member of an Opposition which has clearly spelt out its position. In the Senate the Opposition successfully indicated our complete opposition to this particular proposal as it affects social security pensioners and, in this case, 24,000 veterans. As a veteran, I am concerned that the Government has failed us in the past. I would like to think that we could be bipartisan in our treatment of veterans, but it is difficult to be bipartisan when we see the treatment that this special group of people receives at the hands of this Government.

         In Question Time today the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gave us an example of his attitude to this particular group of people. He underlined the deception that is inherent in this legislation, and the Opposition attempted to take him to task for that before we went to dinner. He denigrates the flag at every opportunity, and for very obvious reasons the flag is precious—not in the sense that he is—to almost every veteran. Yet the Prime Minister continues his denigration.

         The Government's knee-jerk reaction to the Bushell case caused considerable anxiety in the veterans community. That piece of legislation now appears to have been consigned to the scrap heap where it belonged in the first place. It set out to diminish benefits to veterans, but there was little consultation with the veterans community. That is a constant source of anxiety. The Government was caught red-handed in attempting to reduce benefits to this very special group of people.

         As I said at the start of my limited remarks, this legislation extends the benefits of having served on active service to servicemen who served in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia. However, many World War II veterans are now aged, and some are suffering more each day. This sort of legislation amounts to harassment, and they should not be harassed by this Government. Some of those veterans have shareholdings, and once again they will be concerned and worried at a time in their lives when they do not deserve to have that imposed upon them. This legislation is petty and it should never have been proceeded with.

         —Let me say to the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) that I have absolutely no problems with his sincerity when he says that these measures are unfair. However, he is dead wrong; these measures are fair. I have already explained my reasons for saying that. This is the first opportunity I have had tonight to say that, if anyone in this House is denigrating anybody, it is not the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), it is those opposite. In the Senate the Opposition, by playing theatrics and by including an amendment to what is essentially a good news Bill, is in effect risking entitlements to UN peacekeeping forces that we have serving in Yugoslavia, Somalia and Cambodia—even 50 miles into Laos and Thailand.

         Those benefits will be at risk if the Opposition continues to oppose this Bill. Honourable members opposite play semantics. They muck around with theatrics, as the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) did today. He made a big deal so that he could go and do a doorstop interview outside and make it look as if the Prime Minister had somehow misled this House. The fact is that the Opposition was just playing semantics—it was playing with words. The reality is that, if the Opposition continues to oppose both these Bills in their present form, then it is endangering the benefits outlined by the Prime Minister today which will affect some 200,000 people.

         —The honourable member for McPherson says that it is blackmail. If there is any blackmail, it is on the part of the Opposition. The fact is that the treatment of shares was something that was passed in December 1992 with the full acquiescence of the Opposition. The Opposition voted for it then, and now it wants to go against it. The ball is clearly in the Opposition's court.

         If at the end of the day the Opposition persists with this, we will make sure that every one of those 200,000 people who will not get these benefits will be told whose fault it was—and it was not ours. I hope that the Opposition has some sense and decides to support the legislation. At the end of the day the treatment of shares would still be the same because that was passed last year, but the Opposition would be depriving veterans—the people the Opposition says it wants to help, and I accept the sincerity of the honourable member for McPherson—of benefits.

         I know that some of these measures are perceived by people in the electorate as being harsh. However, there is no bottomless pit. We are in government, not the Opposition. Those opposite were rejected quite categorically on 13 March. We are in government; they are in opposition. We have to make the decisions. Sometimes those decisions are not going to make us popular with a certain section of the population, but someone has to make those decisions—and we are making them.

         We are targeting the welfare dollar in the best possible way. We are answerable to the total Australian public; we are answerable to the taxpayer. We have an obligation to ensure that, irrespective of the theatrics that have been going on here all day today, that money is spent correctly.

        (1)It excludes shares and other listed securities from the definition of investment product in the Veterans' Entitlements Act and thereby prevents the equitable assessment of the ongoing gains made on shares and other investments listed on the Stock Exchange compared with indirect investments in shares through equity trusts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        (2)The amendment will reduce the equity of the service pension income test. The assessment of ongoing capital gains on shares ensures that equity of the service pension income test is enhanced. Pensioners with the same means and the same financial resources available to them should have the same amount of income assessed for service pension purposes. People who invest in shares should not be treated more beneficially than those who invest in equity trusts or other managed investments, and they should not be treated more beneficially than those pensioners who invest in income generating investments such as bank accounts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        (3)The amendment would result in the expenditure of approximately $20 million in a full year on a group of clients who generally have substantial financial resources.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        (4)There is no reason why shares should be excluded and given privileged treatment. It is a principle of the income test that ongoing gains are treated as income for all investments that can be readily realised and utilised by pensioners for their support. Only those investments which are not readily realisable, such as real estate and shares held in private companies should be exempt. Listed shares can be sold in small or large bundles at any time allowing gains on listed shares to be readily utilised by a pensioner.

I was locked out of the division prior to the last one and I witnessed the honourable member for O'Connor burst through the door and push an attendant aside when that attendant expressly asked him to remain outside the chamber. Of course, the rest of us obeyed her decision and remained outside.

        The purpose of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1993 is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1987 to put beyond doubt the construction of item 41A of schedule 4 to the Act. Item 41A is a key element of the legislative mechanism for implementing the Government's passenger motor vehicle manufacturing plan. From its commencement paragraph (a) of item 41A and the customs by-laws made in respect of that item have always been intended by the Government to benefit only the five `plan producers' by allowing them duty free importation of certain passenger motor vehicles where they have earned export credits under the export facilitation scheme in accordance with the plan and hold the appropriate determinations under that scheme.

         In extending the scheme with effect from January 1991, item 41A was amended by the addition of a paragraph (d) to allow non-plan producers such as component manufacturers to benefit directly from export credits they had earned under the export facilitation scheme. Previously non-plan producers could only benefit through the sale of their credits to plan producers.

         It has recently been contended that these provisions and the customs administrative by-law could have allowed the duty-free importation of such passenger motor vehicles by importers not holding such determinations under the scheme. The Government's automotive policy sets out a schedule for the gradual reduction of tariff levels through to the year 2000. The intent of this policy, announced as part of the 1991 industry statement, is absolutely clear. The policy reflects the Government's commitment to reducing assistance to the automotive industry, but at a rate that is manageable and sustainable by that industry.

         The plan has provided Australia's motor vehicle and component manufacturers with a clear direction in meeting the challenges of motor vehicle and component manufacture in the 1990s. Under the plan, motor vehicle and component exports have reached record levels, exceeding $1.2 billion per annum. Confidence in the industry's future is reflected in recent decisions to upgrade and extend manufacturing facilities.

         The possibility of uncertainty in the plan's legislative mechanism could seriously undermine the benefits achieved to date. The industry has every right to expect that the plan will be maintained as previously announced by the Government. The Government is therefore acting to preserve the integrity of its automotive industry policy by expressly stating that for an importer to benefit under paragraph 41A(a) of the Act they must be the owner of a determination under the export facilitation scheme.

         Child disability allowance, or CDA, is paid in recognition of people who care for disabled children at home. Several reforms in this Bill will improve the effectiveness of this important payment. First, it will become possible for CDA to be shared between two people who share the care and control of a disabled child but one or both of whom do not receive family payment for the child. People who receive family payment as well as CDA for a child can already have both payments split in this way and this amendment makes sure that the same treatment is given all round.

         The payment of CDA during a child's temporary absence from home has proved difficult for administration of the payment. It is to be made clear for all new claimants of CDA that payment is to be made only while the child is being cared for in the family home and during specified respite or hospitalisation periods. Also, all current recipients of CDA will now continue to qualify for CDA while the child is in short-term hospital care. Lastly, a limit of 12 months is to be placed on the backdating of CDA to the date of another, similar claim. Earlier cases of backdating for five to 10 years had highlighted problems with collecting information about a child's disability or care requirements for such a long time in the past.

A range of amendments builds on these provisions.

If the client fails to return the usual fortnightly income statement, there is currently no basis on which to calculate the debt.

As a result, cases that had been dealt with summarily—by a magistrate—are often now handled as indictable offences by judge and jury. It has been decided to revert to the 12-month penalty so that the more appropriate means of dealing with offences may be consistently employed.

        The main purpose of this Bill, the second of two associated Bills, is to amend the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 to set the amount of the charge payable under the previous Bill and to specify when the charge is to be paid. This Bill provides that the annual charge payable for ASO safeguards activities by each uranium producer is $500,000, or a lesser amount if the regulations so provide.

         I will say in my remarks on the next Bill that the uranium companies would pay no more than is reasonable, having regard to the nature and costs of the relevant activities undertaken by ASO. This will be achieved by ensuring that the regulations annually specify an amount, less than the upper limit in the Bill, which represents the reasonable costs of the relevant activities undertaken by the ASO in that year.

         It is the Government's clear intention that the uranium companies will be fully consulted each year on the planned program of ASO activities and costs and the charge proposed, before the final charge is set in the regulations. In other words, company officials will sit down each year with the Director of Safeguards and other relevant officials and seek to agree on the level of ASO activity in relation to the companies' operations.

         Naturally, the Government must retain the ultimate responsibility to determine the annual charge to ensure that the safeguards and physical protection programs fully meet all requirements and obligations, so that the uranium mining companies may keep operating. However, the views of the companies will be fully considered each year, and the Government will itself continue to pay for ASO activities which benefit the Government and the Australian community generally.

         The ASO's program of activities for 1993-94 is of course not determined at this stage, so the charge for 1993-94 cannot yet be specified. We have, however, arrived at an indicative  charge based on ASO's 1992-93 program. On this basis, we estimate an annual charge of about $340,000 for each of the uranium companies. The maximum charge specified in the Bill—of $500,000 for each uranium producer—has been set to ensure that the legislation will not require frequent amendment. I emphasise, however, that it does not represent in any sense the charge that will in fact be payable by the companies unless and until their reasonable shares of ASO costs should approach this amount.

        The purpose of this Bill and the associated Bill is to impose a charge on commercial uranium producers in Australia to recover some of the costs of the Australian Safeguards Office, ASO, in undertaking nuclear safeguards and physical protection activities.

         This cost recovery proposal rests on two fundamental principles. First, those who derive benefit from an activity should pay for it, so long as the amount recovered is reasonable having regard to the nature and costs of the activity.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Second, those who pay should have a genuine opportunity to examine and be consulted on the necessity, quality and cost of the activities they are paying for. This is required not only on equity grounds, but also because it imposes a discipline, in addition to that of normal parliamentary scrutiny, on the provider of the activities—in this case the ASO—to deliver them as effectively and efficiently as possible.

         The ASO cost recovery arrangements to which the Bills would give effect will be fully consistent with these principles. In particular, the Government accepts that a substantial proportion of the activities of the ASO provides benefits to Government and to the Australian community generally. The costs of ASO activities not specifically directed at or relevant to industry will continue to be met by the Government, which will remain the largest contributor to ASO resources.

         Other countries charge their industries for nuclear safeguards and related activities, including the United States, Canada and Sweden. Moreover, cost recovery for undertaking regulatory and other activities, based on the same general principles I have outlined, applies quite widely across Australian industry. In the primary industries and energy portfolio, it currently applies to activities undertaken by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, as well as to many of the projects of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, the Australian Geological Survey Organisation and the Bureau of Resource Sciences. Activities of the National Residue Survey and the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals are also subject to cost recovery arrangements.

         Before commenting on this particular Bill I will say a little about the ASO and its activities. Established by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, the Director of Safeguards and the ASO manage domestic and international nuclear safeguards and physical protection programs in accordance with our stringent nuclear safeguards policies and requirements.

         ASO has a key role in ensuring that uranium produced in and exported from Australia is used only for peaceful purposes and is not diverted into non-peaceful programs. In short, a significant proportion of ASO's program exists, and the associated costs are incurred, because of the need to safeguard our uranium industry. These are the costs the Government has decided to recover. I shall return to this point when commenting on the associated Bill.

         This first Bill provides in its substantive clause—clause 3—for a charge to be imposed on the companies which produce and export uranium in commercial quantities. Both Bills commence on 1 November 1993. In recognition that it is reasonable for a producer to have generated a cash flow before being liable for the charge, we have provided that no charge is payable until some uranium has been exported from the relevant processing facility.

         The uranium industry has been going through a difficult period in recent years. Prices have been low and, at the Ranger plant in the Northern Territory, production has fallen and some workers have been retrenched. Happily, prices have increased quite significantly in the last few months. Although the industry is by no means fully recovered at this stage, I am pleased to note recent comments by senior officials of Ranger's parent company, Energy Resources of Australia, that the market has strengthened recently, utilities are showing an interest in talking about future demand, and ERA has a number of new contracts under negotiation.

         I also note that Western Mining Corporation intends to increase uranium production from its Olympic Dam mine at Roxby Downs in South Australia as part of a mine production expansion program in the near future. Our decision to charge the companies for nuclear safeguards has not been made without regard to industry conditions. We estimate that the two current uranium producers, both of which have remained profitable despite the industry problems, will each pay only about $340,000 annually at the present level of ASO activity, representing about 20c per kilogram of uranium produced. This is less than one half of one per cent of the present value of uranium production.

Furthermore, the arrangements for determining the annual charge payable by the companies, which I shall describe shortly in discussing the associated Bill, will give them a genuine opportunity to influence through consultation the actual amount they would pay each year. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum for it and the associated Bill.

          —by leave—The first report which I have tabled deals with the construction of 210 dwellings at Palmerston in Darwin—70 of which will be for service personnel and their families and the balance of 140 houses will be offered for sale to private purchasers. The project will be undertaken in three stages at a net cost of $14.2 million.

          The committee has recommended that the project proceed as planned. The committee concluded that there is a need for the Defence Housing Authority to provide appropriate housing to cater for the increased Army presence in the north. The site at Palmerston is ideally located for Army personnel working at Waler Barracks. The proposed construction of facilities, comprising Waler Barracks, for the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, was the subject of an inquiry and report by the committee during 1992. This proposal is therefore directly related to that development.

          Palmerston, which was established in 1980, is located 22 kilometres east of Darwin and currently has a population of 8,000 residents. The houses will be located in the suburb of Driver and will be built on 114 lots. The proposed development has been designed to comply with local planning guidelines. Considerable regard has therefore been given to road patterns and the provision of open space which are reflected in the civic design concept and the landscape master plan.

          The committee has concluded that there is a need to provide suitable dwellings for those service personnel from RAAF base Amberley occupying substandard houses and temporary rental accommodation in the Leichhardt and Amberley areas.

          An urban planning concept was developed for the proposal. This aims to achieve a mixed density neighbourhood based on integrated allotment, housing and road planning design principles. Local housing precincts have been designed to have the focus of a small village reserve or landscape feature. Whilst the committee is generally satisfied with the planning and design of the proposed development, its report makes a number of recommendations in relation to the provision of specific features in the houses.

          First, the committee has recommended that the Defence Housing Authority provide all dwellings with solar hot-water systems. This recommendation is consistent with the stand taken by the committee on previous occasions. Solar hot-water systems are a community norm and the authority should demonstrate its commitment to energy conservation. Secondly, the committee has recommended that smoke detectors and earth leakage circuit breakers should also be installed in the houses. Again, the committee believes the provision of these features is consistent with community expectations.

          The report does recommend, however, that the final design of the proposed car park will need to reflect its environmentally sensitive location and that defence should ensure that personnel to be employed on the redevelopment base use public transport to the maximum extent possible.

          , however, I would like to compliment the Navy on the way it has gone about this project in elaborate consultations with local residents and the local council. The only quibble I would have with the project is the extent of car parking on the base, on two basic grounds: first, the cost to the taxpayers because a couple of million dollars is proposed to be spent on car parking for this base; and, secondly, the wider problem of subsidising and creating overdependence on car usage, particularly in urban areas.

          This particular base does have a history of some trouble with access by motor vehicle to and from the site. I think the Government has to really look at all of its projects to try to reduce the overdependence on car usage, particularly in urban areas, because we just simply cannot afford the costs in urban sprawl, pollution, hospital costs and fuel imports. It makes a mockery of the Government's statement earlier today about reducing greenhouse emissions when one puts 200 cars on a base such as this which is right in the heart of Australia's largest urban area.

         Several issues were raised in the course of discussions, among them the Maastricht Treaty. We were fortunate enough to be in Europe when the French referendum on the treaty was held on 20 September. The yes case was carried by the barest of margins—51.05 per cent—and it was clear that the issues involved related more to the domestic politics of France than to the merits of the treaty and what it meant to Europe as a whole. It was extremely interesting to see the interplay between the European nations: the tensions; the difficulties of regionalism, or lack of regionalism in some cases; the principle of subsidiarity; the feeling in some areas that they were not being properly represented by their nations in the debate about a single Europe.

         There was the issue of Yugoslavia. On page 37 of the report, it is stated in conclusion that the delegation was not fully persuaded that there was no possibility of an escalation of the Yugoslav conflict. Remembering that the report was put together soon after our return in October last year, it is tragic that we have subsequently witnessed the bloodshed and mayhem of which we were afraid when we discussed these issues with our European colleagues.

         As far as agricultural issues are concerned, those who had discussions with us came away with a better understanding of Australia's viewpoint and of the impact of foreign policies on our farmers, our livelihoods and agricultural economy than they had prior to the discussions. Whilst we could understand their views to some extent, it was important for them to understand that we could provide foodstuffs to Europe much more efficiently and at much lower prices than they could with their heavy subsidisation policy. It was also important for them to understand what effects the American enhanced agricultural program, EAP, and the subsidisation of exports had on other producers.

If even one member, the leader, or deputy leader were to remain the same between delegations, there would be a sense of continuity. We have made recommendations on how that could be achieved.

         It was one of those delegations where we never tired and never wanted to miss any sort of meeting or discussion for fear of missing something substantial. It was termed a visit to the European institutions, and it certainly was that. In fact, we came away from Europe marvelling at the different number of institutions involved in the decision making which affects Europe as a whole. There was the European Parliament, the Council of Europe, the European Commission Council of Ministers, the European Commission, NATO, the North Atlantic Assembly, the OECD, the Strasbourg Conference on Democracy and, of course, the different national parliaments that we visited.

We are powerless to act or to intervene'. The truth is that very few, if any, countries in Europe are going to shed the life of one young soldier for the Balkans. There was a complete paralyses then—as there is now—in how to respond to the butchery and disaster that is now engulfing Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia and, of course, does threaten Macedonia and one or two of the other former republics of the federal republic of Yugoslavia.

         Under the new arrangements, the Health Insurance Commission can plan and establish a scheme which will allow the payment of rebates for child-care costs to parents who are working, studying, training or seeking work. Such an amendment to the Act is required to enable the Health Insurance Commission to devote resources to develop and establish systems and procedures to register carers, register eligible families and make payments under the scheme from 1 July 1994. The new arrangements will also enable the Health Insurance Commission to administer a child-care cash rebate as specified by an Act. Such a scheme will be specified in amendments to the Child Care Act 1972, which is scheduled for amendment in Autumn 1994.

         The child-care cash rebate is part of the Labor Government's comprehensive child-care policy which recognises that most parents need quality child care at some stage of their working lives and that they need help with the cost of child care.

The rebates will significantly improve the affordability of child care for working parents.

An estimated 230,000 families, with 358,000 children, will benefit from the scheme. After the first $16 of weekly child-care expenses, eligible families will be able to claim 30 per cent of their child-care costs up to a ceiling of $110 per week for one child in care and $220 per week for two or more children. The maximum child-care cash rebate will be $28.20 per week, or $1,466 per year, for one child and $61.20 per week, or $3,182 per year, for two or more children.

         —I rise to state the position of the Opposition on the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill. I think at the outset it should be made clear that this is not a debate about the Government's child-care policy; this is a debate about how the Government is to implement its child-care policy. The second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) made that clear. In the Senate, when this matter was being debated, the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) said very clearly that this is not the child-care policy. She said:

        Nothing can be done in the area of implementing of cash rebates until the Child Care Act is amended later on.

       <para>
        She went on to say that we shall not see that Bill until some time in the Budget session. So we are not tonight debating child-care policy. I say that because the Minister in the Senate to a large extent misrepresented the concerns that the Opposition had about this Bill. I would not like to see that repeated in here tonight. So, armed with the foreknowledge of the sort of misrepresentation of the Opposition's position that took place in the Senate, I lay that out very clearly here.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This Bill gives powers to the Health Insurance Commission to do something it does not have power to do at the moment. At present, its legislation restricts it to undertaking preparatory work in relation to health insurance or other health related matters. This Bill will enable it to undertake preparatory work in relation to the Government's child-care policy, not the implementation of the policy.

         However, the Bill does rather more than just allow the Health Insurance Commission to undertake some preparatory work. During the debate in the Senate the coalition and the Australian Democrats expressed considerable alarm. The Bill breaks new ground in the use of tax file numbers, to which the coalition has said it will not agree. We are agreeing to this Bill because we do not raise an objection to the Health Insurance Commission having the power to look at how something might be implemented. What we are objecting to is that the Health Insurance Commission has clearly no discretion in how this matter is to be implemented. I will refer in due course to some statements that were made during the election campaign, in Senate estimates committees on this matter just very recently, and in the debate on this Bill in the Senate, to illustrate those concerns.

         We will not raise any opposition to the passage of the Bill, as I have said. We agree that the charter of the Health Insurance Commission should be broadened sufficiently so that it can examine implementation of the child-care rebate system. Our concern is that the Health Insurance Commission will clearly have no discretion in a vital part of the mechanism. It does not have the power to fully report on methods of implementation; it has been told the system has to be implemented in only one way. That instruction on implementation is a direct breaking of an election campaign undertaking by the Government on the subject of privacy. I will come to that in a minute.

        Three cheers for the ultimate triumph of sanity and reason. I do not know for how many decades women have been saying that child care should be recognised as a legitimate expense of working where they are dependent children and they are their dependent children.

         For the last 10 years this Government has been under pressure on that subject. It has long since been an undertaking of the Liberal Party and the National Party, in a series of election campaigns, that, if elected to government, we would move to recognise the very basic principle that a parent who has the prime responsibility for the care of children, and who needs to take on child care in order to earn an income, has incurred that expense of child care as a necessary part of earning that income. Overwhelmingly this relates to women.

We were told that the way to do it was to subsidise the cost of child care. Finally, obviously, the pressure has become too much for the Government and now there is a recognition that, as the Parliamentary Secretary said in his second reading speech `. . . the cost of child care is a legitimate expense for parents in earning an income' and that:

        If this is the way that this matter goes ahead, a matter of very basic equity has to be considered. The figure of 240 Medicare offices around Australia sounds like a lot of offices, but it is not when one is talking about a population like that of Australia.

         Until very recently my electorate included rural areas, including the very significant rural area of Beaudesert, and it still includes a very long strip of the Gold Coast, which is a strip of provincial city population some 40 kilometres long. A very high proportion of my constituents are pensioners. Many people are in the position of having only one Medicare office to go to. Many of my elderly constituents do not own motor vehicles and do not drive cars and it is a hardship for them to travel to this one office. Many times I have made representations for extra Medicare offices and they have been rejected. I know that many honourable members have been in that position. There has been a view around—

         I thought it was because the Health Insurance Commission some years ago took on a huge computer with a capacity far outside its needs, obviously with the ID card as part of its planning, and it had to find a way to fill that capacity. A number of people who previously could make medical rebates were suddenly told that they could no longer. People had to do it by mail and the computer could print out the cheques, but there is apparently another reason.

         I return to the Opposition's initial concern about the issue. A few minutes ago I referred to the breaking of an election undertaking and I would like to outline to the House precisely what that was. During the election campaign a concern was raised through newspaper reports that the Government was going to require child carers to provide tax file number information to Medicare, administered by the Health Insurance Commission as a method of implementation. This raised concern.

         The Australian Privacy Foundation contacted the office of the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), then Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, about it. An assurance was given by Minister Staples's private staff that a tax file number would not have to be provided to the Health Insurance Commission. In other words, during the campaign a concern was raised in relation to the tax file number because a newspaper got a whiff of the Government's intentions regarding this issue. When the concern was taken up and pursued by the privacy foundation, Minister Staples's office hit it on the head. The spokesman from Minister Staples's office did not tell the truth, because this Bill will enable the Government to implement exactly that policy.

The Opposition was accused of saying that the Government's policy was that child-care users would have to provide tax file numbers. I have read and reread that Senate debate. At no time did the Opposition say that. The Opposition just took the case as the Government put it and showed the dangers of that procedure. The public—people who care about the extended use of the tax file number, which would be improper—were lied to during the election campaign. There is no doubt about that.

What was denied, absolutely and specifically, during the election campaign is exactly what this Bill is about. At no time since has the Government responded to that.

We have to ask why, in all the debate about the Australia card and its ultimate dumping and in all the subsequent debate about upgrading tax file numbers for the tax lurk purpose that the Australia card was supposed to meet, the Government went to some pains to say, `The tax file number will not be used as a de facto ID card'.

         The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security has a couple of words bubbling up, I can just tell. Maybe he did not think that. I want to make this very clear point: the then Treasurer, the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), very specifically undertook that use of the tax file number would not be extended in a way that would intrude into non-relevant areas. There were, I admit, some government backbenchers who put forward a different point of view, including the present Minister for Family Services. She put the view that if a tax file number were put in place it could be a de facto ID card.

         Very significantly I believe—as does the Opposition—that there is a danger. If the Government is fair dinkum about not extending use of the tax file number in a way that is bound to cause harm and intrusion, it has a range of alternatives. It could, of course, do what the Opposition said it was going to do, and I would like to refresh the memory of government members on the Opposition's policy on this matter. Our child-care policy statement reveals that we would have administered our child-care rebate scheme as follows:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Individuals who provide child care on which a rebate is to be claimed will be required to register with the Tax Office. Each registered carer will then be provided with a Registered Carer's Number which must be quoted on all rebate claim forms.

        Parents will have the option of claiming the rebate either fortnightly, in which case payment will be made in cash and available through Medicare offices, or annually in which case the rebate will be calculated as part of the parents' tax return.
       </para>
       <para>
        The administration of this scheme by the Government and by the Opposition would not be very different, with one critical exception. The Government will require the carer, the provider of child care, to give to the Health Insurance Commission a tax file number. The Opposition was going to say to the carer, `Here is a registered carer's number'. That number would be given again by the Tax Office, but there would be no revealing of that tax file number which can link into so many other things. It would be a special number issued by the Tax Office which would then be passed on to the person claiming child care to quote when obtaining a rebate. It is a very simple alternative system.

         Another alternative which was raised by Senator Harradine in debate and which was not, I believe, properly answered—and I hope it might be better answered when we debate the actual system in the Budget session—was the possibility of looking at the plain tax rebate system. That is a possibility. The objection that the Minister raised was that a number of people—and she made it sound like a huge number of people—who would be benefiting from this provision are not taxpayers. A number of them are not, that is true. A number of them are students or people who are undertaking further training before re-entering the work force or something like that. However, when pressed on the issue, the Minister could give no break-down of the figures at all.

       <para first-indent="16">

         I think that it should be possible to give some close notional figure. If one knew what the break-down was between tax paying people who are going to be looking for this child-care rebate versus non-tax paying people, and then a break-down of the non-tax paying categories—at least a notional one—then it would be possible to construct something that would fit the situation. But, after saying, `No, we could not possibly do that because so many of them do not pay tax', the Minister then could not give any clue at all about how many that was. To me, it was just a way of dismissing the argument without looking at the merits. Frankly, I am sorry to say that because I have a personal regard for the Minister. But in my opinion she ended up looking very foolish on that particular subject.

         For the first time, service providers as against benefit recipients will have to provide a tax file number. That is breaking new and quite dangerous ground. There was a suggestion some time ago, which the Government hastily dropped—and we might come to it in debate on the next health Bill—that pharmacists should be linked into the Health Insurance Commission system. This was to be done for the sake of checking on the eligibility for benefit of particular types of beneficiaries who presented with prescriptions. There was such an outcry about it that the Government had to drop the proposal that a service provider be linked into the system by computer.

         But now we come to what appears to be a very much more acceptable area of debate: that of child care. I am sorry to say that again the Minister doubled back and contradicted herself several times in the course of the debate. She got really very confused indeed about whether what was in this Bill was a proposal. After it was made very clear at an estimates committee hearing that the Government had decided this was the way to go, she then tried to get out from under by saying that this was `quite innocent legislation'. She then said:

        I have already referred to that. She said that it was `just a proposal' which the Health Insurance Commission was looking at.

         The coalition made a proposal which was ignored.

So when the Minister was saying that this was `just a proposal', she was being too coy and too ingenuous by half. It is far more than just a proposal. The Government has taken a decision which the coalition urges it to move away from.

They let all this go ahead, and here they are trying to stop the child care. They are against child care; they are against women; they are against all these other things'. And that would not be true.

         In conclusion, as I said at the beginning of my speech, this is not a debate about child-care rebates. That debate will come in the form of amendments to the Child Care Act, as the Minister said. We are amending the Health Insurance Commission Act here tonight. We will then consider all of these things fully, look at who is affected and consider the alternatives should the Government decide to go ahead with the implementation of the tax file number. I urge the Government to make a decision; that it gives the Health Insurance Commission genuine freedom to look at proposals for implementing its child-care policy and that it puts those proposals forward, as this Bill gives the Health Insurance Commission the power to do. The only thing that will not empower the Health Insurance Commission to do that will be if the Government, through private directive—not through legislation—tells the Health Insurance Commission that it may not look at the alternatives but must instead stick with this so far unexplained but entirely obnoxious proposal of implementation of the tax file number for a purpose which we had been assured in this Parliament would never be put.

It is quite clear from the second reading speech on the Bill that it is an enabling piece of legislation and that all bets will be up and available for people to fully debate the child-care legislation. With this Bill, we will have to make sure that we have accountability. Of course, whatever is finally decided, and the recommendations that come back, it will be public money and we have to make sure that we are efficient and accountable as a government.

         I return to the Bill. I think there are considerable areas of agreement between the Government and the Opposition on this matter. This enabling legislation will allow the Health Insurance Commission to provide the Parliament during the recess with some plans to establish and administer this scheme. We all agree that it is necessary to provide working parents with the ability to get some assistance—which is very essential—to enable them to look after their families and be productive in our economy. We are not trying to do anything by stealth. This very useful initiative that I believe really caught the imagination of the electorate is to enable families to use the Medicare system to provide this kind of facility for parents.

         One of the very positive aspects of these proposals is the efficient use of existing government services to provide a further family support initiative rather than develop a new bureaucracy. The honourable member for Moncrieff is splitting straws at the idea of the Taxation Office putting forward a new tax number, some other way of identifying the child-care providers. It would seem to be nitpicking to me. Of course, we will have to find some way of making sure that the transactions are codified but that will be presented as a range of proposals. I am sure there will be much debate in both Houses when the proposals are introduced.

         The Medicare office and what it symbolises has become part of our national culture, and I firmly believe the threat to the viability of the Medicare system was one of the many aspects of coalition policy that led to the electorate rejecting the coalition at the recent election.

         These initiatives will further improve the position of Medicare in the national psyche as an outreach service by government to the community. Hopefully—and here is my further point of agreement with the honourable member for Moncrieff—in cities such as Rockhampton and other regional centres, in Capricornia and elsewhere, there may well be the need for an extension of service delivery points which will enable easy access for both Medicare refunds and child-care rebates. It is certainly an issue of concern in regional areas.

         Accessibility, both physical and temporal, is an important aspect of the proposed scheme. Families will be able to claim the rebate by mail or in person each week as they incur the cost for work-related child care. In comparison, tax rebates, which the honourable member for Moncrieff suggested, tend to favour higher income earners and there is often a long waiting period. Taxation deductions also disadvantage low income earners, part-time workers and students, all of whom are much more effectively covered by these proposals. At the end of every week, at the point where the costs are being incurred, working parents will be able to recoup a portion of those costs.

At the end of the week when hard-pressed families will be trying to balance their budgets, that will be very helpful. The cash rebate will not be income tested and will be available to parents working full- or part-time, studying or training, or looking for work. These are truly very effective initiatives and were very positive parts of the proposal put forward in the campaign.

         The child-care cash rebate scheme will be available for costs incurred where parents use both formal accredited child-care programs and informal arrangements such as family members, neighbours and nannies.

Seventy per cent have children between the ages of five and nine and all these children are requiring either full day care, after school care or care in relation to shift work. I think it is important to recall what the report had to say about this very important social justice issue for working parents and particularly women workers. It stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The paramount issue identified by the vast majority of submissions which dealt with women and employment was that of child care. The submissions almost universally argued that good quality, affordable child care was the basic necessity for women to have a realistic choice as to their life options.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will refer to one other section of the report which stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The fact that inadequate child care impacts so greatly on women rather than men in terms of workforce opportunities is a stark reminder of how society and largely parents see mothers as the prime carers of children. Given this, there is a temptation to portray child care as a `women's issue'. The evidence to the Committee strongly rejects this proposition and argues that child care is an economic and productivity issue as well as a basic test of the community's commitment to equity.

        There is no doubt that this debate has been going on for a long time and many political representatives, many women's groups, have been advocating this position for a considerable time. It certainly has been responded to by the Government in the New National Agenda for Women, which made the point:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Child care is an issue for families, for employers, for unions and for all levels of government. We need to work together to build a strong child care program and to make things work both at home and work.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, it is important to see that over the last 10 years of Labor governments a great deal has been achieved. I disagree with the honourable member for Moncrieff in her interpretation of those events. Let us look at the facts. Commonwealth funded child-care places have increased from 46,000 to 193,000 from 1983 to 1990, and the Government has announced a commitment to ensure 250,000 places by 1995-96. The Government has increased spending on child care from $65 million in 1983 to $440 million in 1992. In 1984 the Government made child-care fee relief available to low and middle income families, and in 1991 fee relief was extended to eligible families using private and employer sponsored child-care services. Over 130,000 families were assisted in 1991.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Government's track record on the expansion of child care has been very creditable. The commitment we are providing for the future, as outlined in the new national agenda for women, gives this Government a great challenge. I believe that we will meet that challenge. We will work with the State, Territory and local governments, community groups and employers to increase child-care places, with a commitment of 250 child-care places by 1996.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Government is also committed to improving the accreditation of child care so that we provide quality child care. It is very important not only that child care be affordable but also that working parents know that, when their children are being cared for away from direct parental supervision, the quality of that care is excellent. The program outlined during the campaign was a real winner for this Government. I have absolute confidence that both sides can look forward to the new legislation with confidence.

         In summary, this enabling legislation is one more step in a proud record of achievement by Labor governments in this country to address the issues of quality and affordable child care. It is very important that we maintain the important issues. The quality of the child care that we provide, the access and the social justice that is involved in providing this are absolutely important to the future development of our children and our country's future. It is very easy for me to commend this Bill to the House.

         When I first entered the work force at the age of 15—that was in 1955; if honourable members have their calculators at hand, they can work out how old I am—it was accepted that girls worked until they got married. They left work when they got married to become full-time homemakers, child-bearers and child carers. The only women who worked were highly professional women—they were in the minority, as they still are in many places—or extremely poor women who had to work in order to keep the family. This was certainly looked down on at that time. I certainly did not live in a very well-off area. The question of child care did not really arise at that time.

         Further on in my life, like a lot of older women, I undertook a tertiary degree. I did this by external study. I met a lot of women who had gone through those stages of homemaking, child-bearing and now, in their middle age, wished to join the work force. By that time it was accepted that it was all right for women to work in their own careers, not just for economic reasons. This has been one of the biggest breakthroughs for women and for families as a whole. It is accepted that women do have careers and can have a life of their own in the work force and not just be dependent.

         I met a lot of very interesting women at university who were studying by that particular method because they could not leave their children. Many went through difficult times with their marriages and their families because they wanted a career of their own and they wanted to study. I saw marriages break up and I saw others consolidate. Child care was a very integral part of this. It is now generally accepted, as I have said, that women can have careers of their own. Child care is being more and more accepted in the workplace and in the community.

         It is significant that several new members of this House have advocated the provision of child care in this place. Mr Speaker is looking at the facilities that can be provided. Women were discouraged from entering parliament until they reached a mature age, like me, because of that problem. The honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) is a good example of a woman who has taken on this role while she has two young children. In the New South Wales Parliament at the moment a new member of the Ministry has borne a child during her time as a member of parliament. When asked how she was going to handle a ministerial position, she said that her one-year-old child was cared for in the Parliament House child-care centre. Obviously, New South Wales has done something about this.

         The more facilities that we have provided in the workplace and in the community, the more scope women will have for furthering their careers. However, in saying that, we are not discouraging women who wish to stay at home to look after their children. Another election promise which will be honoured is to provide extra assistance for women who choose to stay at home to look after their children. In my electorate, which is not quite the same size as that of the honourable member for Capricornia—although we do have quite a lot of isolated places—there are insufficient child-care places. With this provision I think we will see the development of more of those places. It is certainly something I will be working for over the next three years and, hopefully, beyond.

         The honourable member for Capricornia also alluded to the fact that child care is now accepted as an economic issue, and I commend the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for announcing these child-care measures as part of his economic statement. Child care is no longer just a welfare issue or a women's issue—indeed, it is not just a women's issue. I have already found in my short term as a member of Parliament that there are men who are child carers and who find themselves in an extremely difficult position when they become sole parents. So those child-care places and child-care rebates will also be of great advantage to men.

         I will not say any more than that. I wanted the House to realise that this is an historic Bill. It will be more fully debated, as has been said, under the child-care legislation in the next session. It must not pass without our acknowledging that we have come a long way, even though it has been slow. The development of opportunities for women, of which child care has been a great part, has been slow, but the opportunities are increasing. There are more women in this place now, and there will be more in the future. Child care is an integral part of enabling those people to become productive members of the work force.

         —in reply—I commend the speeches of the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) and the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) on the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill. I concur with the comment of the honourable member for Macquarie that this is an historic piece of legislation, especially in the area of women's rights. Although the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) tried to represent it as only a small step, in fact, it is one of the most important and significant steps because it commits the Government to a timetable to implement the changes and to develop the full system to bring before this Parliament.

         One could not imagine anything more democratic than that. Firstly, the commitment was made in the election. Secondly, the Government brought in the enabling legislation to study ways and means of bringing in the whole process and to allow the planning towards implementation to take place.

         The honourable member for Moncrieff chose not to compliment the Government for the speedy implementation of an election promise. We have heard a lot of nonsense from the Opposition and some of the media about the Government not meeting election promises, but here is an historic piece of legislation that will meet a very important election promise, especially with respect to the rights of women. The honourable member for Moncrieff hardly emphasised that. Instead, she ranged widely in her discussion. She even referred to the comments earlier today of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when she said, `Look, if we block this legislation because of the so-called concern which is raised about the tax file number'—and I will return to that in a minute—`and if we block this legislation with the Democrats, the child-care rebates will not come through for all the people who are to benefit, but don't blame us because, after all, it is your fault'.

What happened? The Opposition brought in something that was the reverse of something that had already been passed by this Parliament and tried to add it to the Bill.

The Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill simply gives the Health Insurance Commission $2 1/2 million, which is the money it needs to go into the details of the proposal and put it forward so that when the Child Care Act is amended an administrative structure will be in place.

         Senator Lees spoke very strongly for the proposal of child-care rebates, as did Senator Newman, and as would I if that was what the debate was about tonight, but it is not. So there is no contest on child-care rebates. The contest is on the Government attempting to use an issue which has total support as a device to do something that clearly the community a long time ago said it did not want and that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) five years ago said in this place would not happen. Keeping the Government honest is what the Opposition was on about. I am sorry, but the Parliamentary Secretary's representation was exactly what I said would happen—dishonest representation of the Opposition's point of view on child care. It had nothing to do with child care.

At one stage, Senator Crowley said that we really ought to be talking about this Bill when we come back with the amendments to the Child Care Act. Of course, what she is trying to do is channel the opposition to the extension of the tax file number into phoney opposition to child care. I take advantage of my right to speak on the third reading to set right something that was misrepresented in the second reading debate.

        What I was intending to do on behalf of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) was point out that the Government has reluctantly accepted the amendments to the legislation which were moved by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats in the Senate. The reason for this is that, in view of the scheduled timetable for the ATSIC elections, the Government has no practical option but to accept the amendments to allow other necessary changes to the ATSIC Act to proceed in time for the ATSIC elections later this year.

It was a source of great pride to the Government that, had these proposals gone forth without amendment, indigenous people in this country would have been able to achieve the social justice milestone of having their affairs conducted by a totally elected body, in this, the United Nations International Year of the World's Indigenous People.

The ATSIC commissioners debated all the issues and, after careful consideration, recommended a fully elected ATSIC.

To give an idea of the vehemence of this criticism, he has asked me to refer to the letter forwarded to all members and senators by the Sydney Regional Council of ATSIC which highlighted that, while the Opposition and the Democrats have been very ready to support the non-election and consequent appointment of two ATSIC commissioners and the chairperson, `this provision is conspicuously absent from our non-Aboriginal elected counterpart in Canberra, the Parliament of Australia, and reflects the paternalism which our non-Aboriginal minders continue to perpetrate upon our people'.

The Minister is convinced, however, that ATSIC will continue to develop and prosper with cross-party cooperation as a genuine vehicle for self-determination for indigenous people in this country and that, within the not too distant future, both the Opposition and the Democrats will be convinced of the desirability of supporting the changes that the Minister proposed in the original draft Bill.

        The purpose of the National Health Amendment Bill 1993 is to clarify doubts concerning the interpretation of section 135AA of the National Health Act 1953, requiring the issue of guidelines by the Privacy Commissioner relating to information obtained under the Medicare benefits program and the pharmaceutical benefits program. Under these two programs the Government receives annually claims for approximately 157 million medical services and 94 million pharmaceutical prescriptions. Over $6 billion annually is spent on these services by the Government. Efficient and accurate processing of this huge quantity of information requires the use of large computerised databases.

         Legislation provides for the privacy of all information gathered as part of the administration of these very large and complex programs. Section 135A of the National Health Act 1953 and section 130 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 require officers to observe secrecy in respect of all information obtained in the course of their duties. The Privacy Act 1988 also applies to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information which is obtained in the administration of the Medicare benefits program and the pharmaceutical benefits program. In addition, the agencies responsible for administering these programs have agreed to be bound by the Privacy Commissioner's data matching guidelines.

         Section 135AA of the National Health Act 1953 complements this general framework by expressly providing that the Privacy Commissioner shall develop, in consultation with affected organisations, privacy guidelines relating to information obtained under the programs.

         The Privacy Commissioner's subsequent consultations on the guidelines, and advice from the Office of General Counsel in the Attorney-General's Department which was provided to the then Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, revealed a number of problems relating to the wording of that section. For example, on one reading of the current provision, personal identification information held in the eligibility enrolment databases—that is, name, address, Medicare card number and pharmaceutical entitlements number—would need to be deleted and reconstructed each five years thereby necessitating the issue of new eligibility cards at considerable public expense for no net benefit. Similar problems may relate to databases containing the names, addresses and qualifications of all approved providers of services and goods. A further difficulty relates to uncertainty as to whether the section applies only to information received after the commencement date of the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act 1991; that is, 27 June 1991.

It also requires that information obtained from claims for medical benefits must be stored in a separate database from information obtained from claims for pharmaceutical benefits, and prohibits linkage of such information except in the way specified in the guidelines.

         —I will be very brief. The National Health Amendment Bill has interesting origins. It is an interesting example of the fact that at times parliament can, through its activities, actually affect what happens in this country. In 1989 Senator Patterson, a Liberal senator from Victoria, happened to ask some questions in an estimates committee hearing relating to the retention of certain information by the Health Insurance Commission. She found that there was no policy in relation to the privacy or security of records. I just reiterate a couple of the figures that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) just gave to this House in the second reading speech. He said:

        The number of services involved gives an indication of the huge amount of personal information that is held in the Health Insurance Commission database, and that is an annual occurrence. It has been established, certainly through estimates committees with Health Insurance Commission witnesses, that where there are patterns of types of medical services—for example, pathology tests—combined with the types of medication prescribed, one can actually identify an individual's medical condition, whatever it may be. The condition does not need to be specified; it can be put together from the information. As a result, the information becomes very personal and is clearly very extensive. We would  all have some amount of personal information on that database—information which is not protected by any particular privacy provisions.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Since 1989 Senator Patterson has pursued this matter in the Senate and through estimates committees with a view to pushing the Government into doing something about protecting the privacy of information on the database. In June 1991 the Government's amendments to the National Health Act sought to establish a computer link between pharmacists and the Health Insurance Commission for the purpose of checking an individual's eligibility for benefits under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It was a huge step at the time—pharmacists being forced to link with the Health Insurance Commission by computer so that certain personal matters could be pursued—when there were other ways of doing it. As a result, matters other than individual benefits could be checked through the system.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The amendments required the issuing of guidelines by the Privacy Commissioner for the management of data generated by the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits program. The guidelines were designed to address the issue of privacy which had been raised earlier. A report to the Parliament in December 1991 by the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance found that the expected savings from the computer checking system were significantly overstated. As a consequence, the Government decided not to proceed with the system. However, the requirement from the Privacy Commissioner to issue guidelines on Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits programs remained.

         By way of an aside, we ought to keep that example in front of us. I repeat that the report by the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance found that the expected savings from the computer checking system were significantly overstated. A proposal which made significant advances in the area of linking personal information, computer databases and service providers with the Health Insurance Commission was a very major administrative step with many implications. Whatever one thinks about it, and however the Government felt about it at the time, it had been suggested that there were significant savings to be made and that was the justification for implementing the system.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Department of Health did not admit that it was wrong. It took the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance to identify that the department was wrong about the savings to be made. If the report had not been written and the inquiry not undertaken, and if the Parliament had agreed to the proposal, then I presume that we would have had this forced linking when the savings simply were not there. We should bear in mind that these claims are made from time to time and that a government acting on them will be taken in a significant direction—a direction, with all its implications, in which it might not want to go—having been persuaded by costings based on incorrect information.

         As the Parliamentary Secretary said on behalf of the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson), a procedure was adopted under which certain guidelines were issued, and certain difficulties were encountered with it. The Bill attempts to address those difficulties. As I understand it, the Privacy Commissioner has foreseen no serious problems with the Bill, but he has identified two areas that he will be monitoring. The first is in relation to the guidelines, which he recommends should not apply to paper files for the present. He will report to the Parliament if he sees any future difficulty with that provision. The second matter relates to the definition of the word `database', and he will also keep an eye on that.

         In conclusion, in the past the Government has held personal health information indefinitely in a readily identifiable form. Prior to the development of the guidelines by the Privacy Commissioner, the Government had no policy on the retention, retrieval and destruction of personalised health information. It is pressure from the coalition which has forced it to address this issue and to take the necessary step through this Bill, which we support.

         —I have pleasure in supporting the National Health Amendment Bill 1993. This Bill seeks to clarify doubts concerning the interpretation of the existing provisions which were identified by the Privacy Commissioner in May 1992. Medicare is the fairest and most equitable health insurance system Australia has ever had. It compares favourably with other health systems throughout the world and is a significant achievement of this Labor Government. The Australian people's confidence in Medicare and their concern for its retention were amongst the principal reasons for the Government's success at the recent Federal election.

         Similarly, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme has played a significant role in providing Australians with prescribed drugs at reasonable cost, particularly in relation to pensioners and lower income earners. Like Medicare, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is an important component in the provision of a health care scheme based on the principles of access, equity and social justice. However, both the Medicare benefits scheme and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by necessity account for a significant amount of Commonwealth budgetary outlays. In the 1991-92 financial year, Medicare benefit payments totalled over $4.5 billion and pharmaceutical benefits totalled nearly $1.2 billion.

         Many of those opposite have very different philosophical views to the Government on questions such as Medicare and the Government's role in funding our health system. The Labor Party believes that governments have a legitimate and, indeed, essential role in providing access to essential services such as health care through Commonwealth expenditure. However, one principle on which there should be agreement on both sides of the House is that when there is an improved government program which is provided at significant cost to taxpayers, such as Medicare or the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, it is essential that the money is spent in the most equitable and cost-effective manner possible and that abuse of Commonwealth money is kept to an absolute minimum.

         The need for privacy legislation is well documented. The intention of the Privacy Act and similar legislation is to protect private individuals against public disclosure of information relating to them which is of a personal or sensitive nature but which is held on file by a government agency. Indeed, individual Australians have a right to expect that personal information in the hands of such authorities should be subject to confidentiality. However, there is a need to ensure that legitimate privacy principles are balanced against the public interest, particularly in relation to the possible misuse of public money. This is the essential aim of this amendment—to clarify privacy provisions to ensure that legitimate privacy concerns of individuals are protected while enabling government agencies, in this case the Health Insurance Commission, to adequately safeguard against fraud and misuse of taxpayers' money.

         Measures which rightly protect the individual privacy of innocent citizens must not be allowed to become a vehicle whereby corporate criminals can defraud the Commonwealth. In my first speech, on 6 May, I referred briefly to the issue of medical fraud and overservicing by medical practitioners, an area in which I have a background of experience. In 1982, the then Labor Opposition drew attention to reports that a Department of Health estimate supported by the Australian Medical Association showed the level of abuse of Commonwealth medical benefits through fraud or excessive servicing to be around $100 million a year. This represented approximately seven per cent of total Commonwealth medical benefit payments, this of course being prior to the introduction of Medicare.

         This led to a Public Accounts Committee inquiry into medical fraud and overservicing which produced an interim report in December 1982. The report was extremely critical of the then Department of Health's administration of the relevant program and made a number of recommendations. This led to a hurried shake-up of senior administration in the department, the allocation of additional resources, and the creation of a new surveillance and investigation division. This all commenced in the dying days of the Fraser Government and was completed by the incoming Labor Government.

         A number of highly trained and skilled staff were employed to utilise a highly sophisticated computer system. However, the best efforts of these staff were undermined by elements of the medical establishment, both inside and outside the bureaucracy. This situation intensified as an increasing number of cases of abuse were being identified by analysis of computer data.

         The threat of increasing exposure of cases of fraud and overservicing caused resentment and hostility amongst sections of the medical profession, although it was never suggested by anyone that anything other than a minority of medical practitioners was involved in cases of abuse. The controversy surrounding this issue coincided with the Medicare doctors dispute in New South Wales in 1984 and 1985. In 1985 the Government decided to abolish the Department of Health surveillance and investigation program and transferred responsibility for control of medifraud and excessive servicing to the Health Insurance Commission.

         This was an understandable decision by the Government in light of the department's ultimate failure to come to grips with the problem and to reduce the level of abuse which was still estimated at the time to be around about seven per cent of Medicare benefits. However, it must be said that the consultant's report which recommended the transfer of the function to the commission was poorly researched, factually incorrect and extremely unfair in its criticism of some aspects of the program, and gave a totally misleading impression of the reasons for the failure of the program. Nevertheless, the transfer of responsibility to the commission was seen as a fresh start by the Government and by the medical profession.

         The Auditor-General's report No. 17 of 1992-93, which was tabled in December last year, deals with the Insurance Commission's performance in dealing with medifraud and excessive servicing since 1985. Some of the findings and recommendations of this report give cause for concern. Among its key findings the report says:

        The report also says that the commission's legislative powers to combat fraud and excessive servicing are deficient in regard to the investigation and prosecution of unethical medical providers, and that the Medical Services Committee of Inquiry, the bodies that deal with cases of excessive servicing, were not operating successfully and should be replaced by tribunals.

         These are just two of a number of examples which were covered by recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee in 1982, but which, as the Auditor-General's report points out, have not been implemented. Another key finding of the Auditor-General's report is of particular relevance to the Bill before us tonight. The Auditor-General found:

        The ability to release information for investigation is important in preventing Medifraud, and the Commission has been reluctant to fully utilise its powers under the Health Insurance Act because of uncertainty about the effect of privacy legislation. A comprehensive policy is needed.

       <para>
        This is a clear example of the importance of clarifying the distinction between privacy provisions in legislation and the need for access to information in the public interest in order to prevent or detect fraud or misuse of Commonwealth funds.

         I would like to take this argument a bit further in relation to the provision of information between government agencies. I am aware of at least one case in recent years where the Australian Taxation Office was seeking to prosecute a medical practitioner for failure to declare taxable income. The Tax Office sought information from the Health Insurance Commission in relation to the doctor's earnings from Medicare benefits. However, I understand that the commission refused to supply the information because of concerns over breaches of the secrecy provision of the Health Insurance Act.

         The point is that the intent of any privacy based provision—whether in a privacy Act or in any other legislation—is surely to protect the privacy of individuals against public disclosure of personal information. I stress the words `public disclosure'. In this case we could reasonably assume that this would mean that names of individual patients of the doctor in question, and details of their medical conditions or medical procedures undertaken, would quite properly remain confidential. However, in this case the only information that the Tax Office had been seeking from the commission was the total Medicare benefits paid to the doctor in question in a given period. No patient details were sought; nor were they required, yet the information requested could not be supplied by the commission because of the secrecy provisions. This further emphasises the need for comprehensive guidelines that strike the appropriate balance between the need for individual privacy and the need for government agencies to have access to necessary evidence in relation to the prevention or detection of abuse of government funds, or recovery of such funds, which is clearly in the public interest. This Bill is an appropriate and timely step in this direction.

         The Auditor-General's report made a number of other observations in relation to medifraud and excessive servicing which I would like to mention briefly. It points out that many of the problems which existed within the Department of Health's program in the early 1980s and which were referred to in various reports of the Public Accounts Committee still appeared to exist and were only just beginning to be addressed by the Health Insurance Commission.

         Further, the report suggests that the previous estimate of seven per cent of the Medicare benefit as the level of abuse could still be appropriate today. Given the current annual Medicare benefit payout of $4.5 billion, this means that the amount of money lost on abuse of Medicare could be in excess of $300 million a year. In this respect, I am encouraged by the recent announcement by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) that he will seek the cooperation of the AMA in attempting to crack down on fraud and excessive servicing.

         It is acknowledged that only a minority of medical practitioners abuse the system.

         As the Auditor-General's report says, the pressures on the Medicare budget are considerable, with the advent of new medical procedures and the growth of entrepreneurial medicine. The emergence of organised fraud and excessive servicing, protected by corporate veils and the best advice money can buy, as the report says, represents a real challenge to the efficient and effective use of the health budget. Clearly, there will be a great responsibility on the commission and the medical profession to meet this challenge. The Bill before us represents a small but significant measure in this context. I commend the Bill to the House.

         In June 1991, the government amendments to the National Health Act sought to establish a computer link between pharmacists and the Health Insurance Commission, and that certainly caused quite a lot of consternation amongst the pharmacists in my electorate. The purpose of that computer link was to check an individual's eligibility for benefits under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The amendments also required the issuing of guidelines by the Privacy Commissioner for the management of data generated by the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits programs. These guidelines were to address the issues of privacy which had been raised by Senators Walters, Patterson and Watson.

         A report to the Parliament in December 1991 by the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance found that the expected savings from the computer checking system were significantly overstated. As a consequence, the Government decided not to proceed with the system. However, the requirement for the Privacy Commissioner to issue guidelines on the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits programs remained. Draft guidelines were prepared by the Privacy Commissioner for tabling by April 1992. However, after advice from the office of general council, he instead made a report to the Parliament in May 1992, indicating that he could not table the guidelines since they appeared to be inconsistent with certain provisions of the National Health Act. This Bill now addresses those provisions.

The answer Senator Patterson was given at Estimates Committee C was that it would be possible in fact to identify these people. That is something about which the community ought to be very concerned.

         —As most honourable members know, I have for many years brought students from senior high schools within my electorate to the national capital on education scholarships. Tonight in the Speaker's gallery I have two young men who are the 33rd and 34th students to participate in this scholarship. They are Bradley Cox, aged 17 years, a year 12 student from Merredin Senior High School, who lives 60 kilometres away in the farming community of Doodlakine—the home of Senator Walsh—and travels to school each day. He hopes to continue studying science at university next year. Also present is Regan Opalinski, aged 15 years, a year 10 student from Katanning Senior High School, who comes from the farming community of Tambellup but boards in Katanning. I take this opportunity to sincerely thank Ansett Australia for its assistance. As is the custom, I have invited both of the students to write a short speech which I now have the pleasure in reading.

         —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. May I take this opportunity—the first I have had—to officially congratulate you on your elevation to that role. Tonight I wish to speak about an issue that affects all Australians—that of youth homelessness. Although this issue has received prominence only in recent years, the many organisations throughout Australia which have been dealing specifically with this national tragedy will attest to the fact that it is not a new one.

         As far as the wider Australian community is concerned, however, it was the publication of the Burdekin report in early 1989 that raised public awareness of the extent and seriousness of youth homelessness because of the extensive media attention it received. The Burdekin report gave estimates of youth homelessness which sent a shudder through the community. It claimed that between 20,000 and 25,000 Australians under the age of 18 were homeless. What was even more shocking was the likely estimate that between 50,000 and 70,000 young people were either homeless or at serious risk. I suspect that for want of a better description these young people were tagged with the name `street kids'. The push to address their plight has helped raise awareness of other youth related issues such as drug abuse and youth suicide.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There are now a large number of organisations throughout the country that are specifically targeting assistance to street kids, and fortunately this is becoming more and more hands-on. There has been criticism in the past that philosophical debates about the cause of the problem were taking precedence over direct hands-on contact with affected street kids. The great challenge for governments, both State and Federal, is to ensure that both aspects are adequately funded and appropriate priorities accorded. Following the tabling of the Burdekin report, an extra $100 million was allocated by the Commonwealth Government over a four-year period specifically to tackle youth homelessness. However, there is still an enormous amount to be done, and appropriate responses need to be both developed and refined.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         While the methodology used by the Burdekin inquiry has been questioned in some quarters, it is my belief that it does the debate no good whatsoever to debate numbers alone. The debate should be centred on appropriate responses at the street level to address the root causes of youth homelessness. It is generally agreed that the primary causes of youth homelessness are family instability and breakdown, poverty and unemployment. The increase in youth homelessness can be directly equated with the deteriorating position of those three root causes.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The serious issues of family instability and breakdown, poverty and unemployment that affect the wider community can therefore be seen to be exacerbating the problems facing Australia's youth. The need to address the immediate requirements of street kids such as crisis accommodation and long-term housing is obvious, and so too is the need to address the issues of job creation, income support and social support.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         While considerable financial and human resources have been allocated in an endeavour to address the youth homelessness tragedy, it is glaringly obvious that there has been no improvement. Indeed, workers in the field are adamant that the situation is deteriorating even further. On that basis, it is a matter of great urgency for the community to address the bigger picture agenda, which should include a review of the availability of education to young people and also the availability of health services and employment opportunities and training.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Probably the saddest aspect of youth homelessness is that in the vast majority of cases homeless young people are in that position through no fault of their own. On that basis the questions of family instability and breakdown, poverty and unemployment must be addressed in the context of being the main causes of, or at the very least major contributors to, youth homelessness.

         In this adjournment debate I wish to draw the attention of the House to the plight of a Victorian citizen and resident of Barbiston Road, Keilor, Mr Jesse Boyse, otherwise known as `Snowy' Boyse. To put this matter into context, Snowy Boyse, who is 73 years of age, owns one of the properties on Barbiston Road which the Federal Airports Corporation, the FAC, is attempting to acquire in order to extend the runways of Melbourne Airport.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Mr Boyse, in a letter to my colleague the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), dated 26 February 1993, explained that some residents of Barbiston Road have, under pressure, accepted FAC offers dealing with residents outside the Lands Acquisition Act 1989, the LAA, by agreement under section 36 of the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986, the FACA.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Snowy maintains that by offering these terms the FAC is precluding residents from the rights and privileges to which landowners are entitled under the LAA, including an equivalent dwelling, stamp duty on the new property, exemption from capital gains tax, removal expenses, and access to all legal expenses in the event of differences of opinion regarding the transaction. Residents have been asked to get valuations on their properties but Snowy protests that there are no potential buyers because it is a well-known fact that the land is `condemned' and `has no sale value'; therefore potential buyers are non-existent.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Snowy, together with a neighbour, Mr Graham Tamworth, wrote to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) to organise a time for a petition from residents to be given to him in Canberra but, through the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), I understand, were informed that the Minister refused.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         According to Snowy, the FAC has been on his property without permission making bore tests for runways and doing a geological survey; yet the FAC has informed him by letter that it does not need his property. Recently Snowy sent a letter to the Minister making a claim for compensation under section 98 of the LAA. The Minister referred him to the FAC and informed him that he did not respond to his claim. Snowy maintains that the Minister should have issued a claim form as required under the LAA. Instead the FAC has been negotiating settlements by agreement under section 36 of the FACA.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         All this becomes rather complicated, but basically Snowy maintains that the Minister has not done his job under sections 97 and 98 of the LAA and he has refused to negotiate with the FAC. It appears that Snowy has right on his side. He has been pushed from pillar to post and has recently been informed by the FAC that unless he is prepared to negotiate with it under its terms and conditions it will let him wait there for up to 15 years before it finally uses the LAA to forcibly take his home and land. By that time Snowy will be 88 years old. Is it any wonder that Snowy regards the FAC as absolutely unscrupulous?
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The FAC—which in its own brochure is described as `a public authority with a private enterprise philosophy'—in 1991-92 made a profit of $142 million which, after the payment of interest, et cetera, became a net profit of $35 million. Snowy Boyse describes that organisation as `private individuals who have been given the jurisdiction over my property—for profit motives'. He goes on to give an account of the FAC's dealings with a Mr Robert Shaw of Rosebank farm, Barbiston Road, Keilor, which are, to say the least, very suspect but too lengthy to deal with here. Mr Boyse concludes his letter by saying that all residents should be dealt with on a `level playing field' as laid down under the LAA.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As the events of 13 March ensued, the shadow Minister was unable to come to Snowy's aid as he had hoped. I therefore wish to draw this matter to the attention of the House and the Minister involved in the hope that Snowy will now receive fairer treatment than he has so far from the FAC. It would appear that on this matter ministerial intervention is most definitely required.
