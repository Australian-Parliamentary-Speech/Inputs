         —It is an unexpected pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill. Mr Speaker, as you know, this is a very important matter and I take cognisance of the personal explanation you made last night and the context of the comments you made on behalf of the government at the time of the original legislation. I had the pleasure of being on the committee that you chaired, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, when it inquired into sports funding and administration. I was a party to the inquiry entitled `Can Sport be Bought?' That puts me in a difficult situation on this legislation.

In the opposition's eyes, the original legislation was put in in haste.

         I thank the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) for ensuring that I have an audience. The issue of tobacco advertising is important. As honourable members mentioned in the debate last night, throughout this parliament we have put in place—as in an overwhelming number of public buildings—a ban on smoking. I am a little disappointed that some of my colleagues have not necessarily heeded that ban. I do not want to be described as having a Stalinist attitude to this issue, but if it is good enough for other people who work in this building to do the right thing, under the directive of the Speaker and the President, then honourable members should see their way clear and not put themselves above that sort of ban.

         Honourable members might be interested to know it is a discussion that I have often had with my predecessor. It makes it a bit difficult because I am a bit one-out in my family. Both my parents were smokers, although, fortunately, my mother is no longer a smoker. My brothers are smokers, and in family gatherings I ain't got the numbers, but I try valiantly to fight the fight. One of the arguments that is always put to me is that if I were not to partake in alcohol perhaps they would stop smoking.

         One of the things that people get excited about with tobacco advertising is its relationship with sport. Fortunately, we see that being phased out. As you know, Mr Speaker, that was one of the central issues that we looked at on the finance and public administration committee. Whilst your associations are different from mine, the importance of association with sport were acknowledged in the report.

         For instance, the AFL club that I have some connection with—not directly in its administration but certainly an emotional attachment—is the Fitzroy football club. It has been sponsored for a number of years by the Quit campaign. That has been a very important and successful association in the public relations and education role. The club has not been as successful on field as it should have been, but that is beside the point. Having clubs such as Fitzroy and others sponsored by the Quit campaign is an important association.

         Likewise, the national basketball team that I have some emotional attachment to, the North Melbourne Giants, has had a long association with various health campaigns. In fact, its association has been on the side of appropriate use of alcohol. For some years, the sponsorship was with the `Booze less' campaign and now they are associated with the `Rage without alcohol' campaign. It is important to note that those in the health foundation that provide the money see that it is valuable to be associated with sport.

         We are attempting to not only put forward and challenge some of the views of adults in our community but also ensure that younger people in our society are exposed to a range of values that can be important down the track and in later life. It is intriguing to have a look at the purpose of tobacco advertising. Whilst we have the argument from the tobacco companies that promotion of their separate products is either to protect their market share or to readjust their market share, I would contend that promotion of tobacco in any way must continue to influence especially younger people considering taking up the habit of tobacco smoking.

         That is a difficulty. That may not be the intention of the companies but there is evidence that it is a consequence of their activities. That is why the legislation we have before us in amending the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 is important. It is an important way of sending signals to our younger generations that there is a downside to adopting a habit that they might associate with some sort of glamorous lifestyle.

         As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) set out in his second reading speech, looking at the Australian situation, nearly 19,000 deaths in the year that the original legislation was passed were directly associated with tobacco consumption. As he stated, tobacco consumption costs our country approximately $9.24 billion each year in health, social and economic costs. Interestingly, last night the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) developed that argument in putting a case to double the amount of excise because he recognised that there was an economic downside to people's continued consumption of tobacco products.

         There is always some direct, but mostly anecdotal, evidence of the way some tobacco companies behave because of contracting markets in more developed countries and their marketing activities in Third World countries. A number of those Third World countries have enormous health problems as it is and they could well do without the pressures of tobacco consumption. So it is important that we view Australia's action in an international dimension.

         Australia has taken a number of measures at national, state and territory levels which have been seen by overseas countries as important examples of what can be achieved. For example, actions by the Victorian and Western Australian governments highlight active involvement in a wide range of health programs, including those such as the Quit campaign, that try to give people the necessary tools to kick the habit. A number of people I know who smoke acknowledge that they are not doing the right thing by themselves but, because of the addictive nature of the habit, it is very difficult for them to kick the habit.

         As I have already exposed the attitude of the previous honourable member for Scullin about smoking, in fairness to him I should say one of the contradictions that were brought to my attention on a number of occasions was that in his career as a medical practitioner, one of the first things he quite often did when advising people was to tell them to stop smoking. When I was down the street or around a polling booth, which is when it seemed to happen a lot, people would come up to me and talk about having visited Dr Harry. They said that one of the things that intrigued them was that whilst they felt so much better now that they had been able to kick the habit—

The fact that the habit enables him to be comfortable is a consideration.

         Two years after the minister for health was seen promoting a habit she was addicted to, she legislates to prohibit its promotion. I speak as a father and grandfather and as one who does not smoke. I have two daughters who used to smoke but, thankfully, they do not any more. One of my daughters is a nurse and she knows of a person who has had all four limbs amputated as a direct result of smoking. Yet, with the stumps of her arms, this woman was still able to put a cigarette in her mouth and smoke. This highlights the harmful effects of smoking, the obvious difficulty with forcing people to quit and the definite need to prevent people from taking up the habit. Once people are addicted, it is terribly difficult to break that addiction.

         There is no doubt that smoking is a death warrant. A cigarette is a lethal, slow killing drug. It is important for us to reduce smoking amongst all Australians. A report of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australia's Health 1994
         </emphasis>
         , stated that a most alarming trend is the rapid rise in female lung cancer since the 1960s. The age-standardised death rate rose 5.7 per 100,000 in 1966 to 17.5 per 100,000 in 1992 as a result of women's increased cigarette consumption since the 1940s. There have been declines in lung cancer death rates in men but they remain three times those of women. The proportion of men smoking declined through the 1980s and into the 1990s, and it is expected this will reduce men's lung cancer death rates over the next decade. Smoking rates in women have also declined, but at a slower rate, which may curb the increase in women's lung cancer death rates.

         There is no doubt about the dangers of smoking. Worse is the frightening statistics about the number of potential cancer victims: that is, young people who smoke and are therefore at a greater risk of getting cancer. The Centre of Behavioural Research into Cancer recently reported an alarming increase in smoking among 13- to 17-year-olds. There are now 260,000 secondary school children smoking about 330 million cigarettes, which is costing them $49 million. The Minister for Human Services and Health made us aware of these awful statistics during question time on Monday.

         Teenage smoking, after initially falling, is again on the rise. The question is: why do people smoke and what starts them smoking? Is it advertising? Is it peer pressure? Is it the taste—though I doubt it—or is it part of all of those and other factors? If it is not advertising, this bill and the act it amends will be useless because, three to five years down the track, young people will still be smoking. Men and women will still be dying from smoking.

         I am confident that anti-smoking campaigns and promotions do work and should be continued. In fact, I believe they could be a bit more forthright, like many of our drink-driving advertisements. They could go along the lines of, `If you smoke, you're a bloody idiot and you're going to die.' You have to spell it out that bluntly. It is an effective advertisement to stop drink-driving and it would be an even better anti-smoking advertisement.

While I have no trouble supporting this bill, I still feel a touch hypocritical supporting a bill which prohibits the right of a business to sell a legally available product. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) last year was condemned for making similar comments. She was condemned by the minister for health, the AMA and the Doctors Reform Society. The latter group would perhaps be better known as the Association of Labor Doctors.

Well, if she is so concerned about it, why is she not campaigning for tobacco to be an illegal product? Why ban the ads? It is the smokes that kill, not the commercials. It comes back to what the former member for Wentworth, John Hewson, talked about on Monday: honesty and politics. If we are all honest with ourselves, smoking would be illegal.

         A survey of Victorian school students in 1992 found that the most prevalent drugs used by students were licit drugs—pain relievers, alcohol and tobacco—which were also perceived by students as the least dangerous drugs.

         It is therefore important for the government to do its utmost to discourage smoking by all people, in particular to prevent young people taking up the habit.

I believe the falling number of smokers is a result of them, and I am more comfortable supporting these campaigns first.

         Tobacco smoking is now widely acknowledged as the major cause of preventable death and disease in Australia. A staggering 19,000 Australians each year die from smoking related illnesses. Tobacco consumption costs Australia the enormous amount of over $9 billion a year in health, social and economic costs. It also causes cardiovascular disease, which is Australia's biggest health problem, and is the largest cause of death from cancer in Australian males.

         My father smoked for a brief period during the Second World War when he was in the air force but he quickly gave it up after the war. My mother never smoked and, unlike a lot of other children my age at the time, I never had any desire to smoke. In fact, I have always had a very negative view of smoking. In 1960 I was in grade 3 and eight years old. I remember we were shown a film at school which, for the times, was fairly graphic. It showed the lungs of a smoker compared with the lungs of a non-smoker.

It is not as though I needed to see the film because, as I have already explained, I never had any desire to be a smoker. I guess there was a time when, like most teenagers, I was a bit curious about smoking. When I was out with friends, I had a few puffs on a cigarette but, whenever I inhaled, I doubled over and nearly choked. Two or three times after that I tried it again, and the same thing happened. That certainly reinforced my view that smoking was not for me.

         Because of my total aversion to smoking and my incapability to smoke, I have never had any desire to smoke marijuana. A lot of honourable members have probably tried that from time to time, and I do not pass judgment on them. I have certainly never tried marijuana, for the same reason that I do not smoke cigarettes: inhaling smoke is something that I find repulsive. All that was back in the 1960s, when I was a teenager. In those days there was not as much public awareness about smoking and the damage that it could cause. There were some reports saying that smoking could cause lung cancer, and we all know that is true. As was revealed the other day in the House, the Menzies cabinet had the opportunity to place restrictions or a ban on tobacco advertising smoking but its members did not think it was necessary. They were more concerned about the profits of the tobacco industry than that of public health in Australia. Like much of what happened during the Menzies years, that is to be regretted.

As smoking is not allowed inside this building, a lot of people can be found smoking outside, where the air is more polluted than it is inside. That is a bit of a worry.

         I was a union delegate in the department in those days. My union certainly supported a smoke free workplace, but we had union members who smoked. There was an attempt to reach a compromise whereby smokers could go off and smoke in a smoking room or whatever. The department took the view that, as the boss had to pay for that, it was not a good way to spend public money. In retrospect, I guess that was the correct view. In 1988 the Australian Public Service as a whole adopted the smoke free workplace, and once again it had the support of the trade union movement, despite the fact that some union members were smokers and had some difficulty with the ban.

I can recall that on at least two occasions at the New South Wales annual conference of the Australian Labor Party—which can sometimes be colourful events—a couple of very vigorous debates about tobacco advertising occurred. At the New South Wales conferences most debates are decided on factional lines, no matter what the topic might be or how controversial it might be. The smoking debate was not decided on factional lines. It was a very closely contested debate. The numbers were unusually close in a couple of those debates.

That created a difficulty at Campbelltown sports ground because it is the home ground of Western Suburbs Rugby League Club. That club plays in the Winfield Cup competition. The club had to have tobacco advertising at Campbelltown sports ground as part of its qualifications for playing in the competition. That created all sorts of legal and political problems.

         In fact, until recent changes to the law, they could not grow tobacco without having a quota licence, which was issued through the Victorian parliament. We have had this odd situation where, on the one hand, governments, state and federal, have been attempting to persuade people through various ways not to smoke tobacco; on the other hand, federal and state governments have encouraged farmers to invest their capital and time in farming operations to grow tobacco. So we can see there is something of a paradox there.

         As you know, the act this bill amends and this bill deal with the future ability of people to acknowledge sponsorships. I have written to the government—the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)—on this issue on behalf of the festival and the community. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) for his letter of 7 February 1995 in which he says that the existing act does not prevent the acknowledgment of sponsors of tobacco manufacturers in the festival. However, it does say that that is the case until the end of 1995. The question the community wanted to raise was: what is the position for the future both under the existing act and the amending bill?

        It seems that the government, through the parliamentary secretary, is acknowledging the relevance and historical nature of the event. The government acknowledges that it will be possible for the festival to continue to be sponsored in part, at least, as I understand it, by the tobacco manufacturers and, for that matter, the tobacco growers that will remain in that area, because it is the government's policy that there will still be tobacco growers in Australia. That is quite firm. Both state and federal governments confirm that.

         I felt then and I still feel now that there is a lot of hypocrisy by the governments, past and present, in this debate. They are very quick to take vast sums of money each year by way of tobacco excise tax levies—ever increasing. They use that to fund their basic budgets now. Those taxes are not allocated directly to the health portfolio so that we can expand our health programs. They are gobbled up by the general consolidated revenue appetite, and under Labor, an ever increasing one, and there is no way that this government—and to be honest, there is no way that a government that I hope to be part of soon—will be able to afford to give away in the next decade or so that vast sum of annual income.

The legislation provides that these sporting functions can continue to be advertised and sponsored by tobacco companies.

         There are certainly arguments at the margins about degree and about the extent of exemptions, for example. But with the exemption of one or two opposition spokesmen in the recent past—and I think that situation has now changed quite significantly—both sides of this House and both sides of politics in this country agree that tobacco sponsorship, tobacco advertising and tobacco consumption generally are a serious threat to the health of Australians at large and, in particular, a serious threat—albeit a deferred one—to the health of young people. Those are some of the issues I would like to canvass in my contribution to this debate today.

         Any debate about smoking and tobacco consumption and the historical context must be considered over a very long period of time. I think the harsh reality is that history will judge Sir Walter Raleigh very sharply. I would not be surprised to find that he becomes known as one of the greatest mass murderers in history. In defence of his memory, I would have to say that, at the time, there was no way he could have known the consequences of his bringing tobacco to the Old World and starting the spread of that substance—that drug—throughout what we now know as Western society and, increasingly, to developing countries.

         I think it is very important to see just what the consequences of his actions will be. Recent studies have shown and latest estimates indicate that by the year 2025 cigarettes will be killing 10 million people a year. It is not too far off—some 30 years from now—that 10 million people a year around the world will die from smoking. That eclipses anything which any other person involved in trying to kill human beings has ever achieved. I think that kind of tally is something which we have to take note of.

But if we look a few years into the future we will see this on a global basis, which is the only real way of doing it when looking at the impact of tobacco smoking, and realise that it will be the cause of death of some 10 million people a year around the world.

         If we examine this at a more mundane and economic level, in both the United States and Australia, because they are the two countries for which more precise figures are available, we can see that the cost in dollar terms—not in terms of people's lives but dollar terms—has reached a staggering $US52 billion per year, which includes all the cost of things like fire insurance, damage and health related costs put together. In the United States, the economic cost of tobacco is in the order of $52 billion a year. This puts into some perspective the comments of the previous speaker about governments and their revenue raising requirements. I intend to say a bit more about that shortly.

         When we look at revenue from tobacco products, we have to take into account the very enormous costs to society and to governments at large of tobacco smoking. If we look at that $52 billion in more personal terms, we will see that it puts the cost of tobacco smoking at something like $8,000 per smoker per year. Of course, there are costs which go beyond the direct economic costs. Those people who smoke are likely to have 6.5 days greater absenteeism from work each year than a non-smoker. That has enormous productivity flow-on costs right throughout the economy, both private and public.

         We also have the impact of deaths from passive smoking—the environmental tobacco smoke question, which is far more uncertain and subject to much more debate these days.

If we think of it in that context—that is, two constituents per week dying from tobacco related illnesses—we realise the real cost of smoking to Australia and to the families in our area and the way in which that impacts not only on their own personal lives—on income forgone for that family, lost opportunities and the loss of loved ones—but also on Australia, the dramatic personal cost to Australia and the economy as a whole.

         The reason for the legislation that we have before us today relates to recent High Court decisions and the need to ensure that this legislation remains viable and is not able to be attacked at a straightforward level by the tobacco companies. The changes we have seen in the High Court recently have meant that we have to be ever much more vigilant about the way in which our legislation is cast. Something which would have been quite clear and unchallengeable a while ago is now subject to challenge on some very interesting grounds.

         The recent political advertising case certainly brought out the interests which we must seek to protect in legislation of this kind, which, in my view, do not go to freedom of speech. The reality is that this is a debate about preventing ill health, about saving the lives of Australians, young and old, and is not a debate about political free speech. Nonetheless, I acknowledge that the High Court is capable of finding those issues in legislation of this kind. Therefore, it is essential in protecting that greater good that this parliament ensures the legislation, so far as possible, is beyond attack in the courts.

         It is very instructive to have a look at some of the words of the High Court in relation to those issues. The justices who looked at this matter—in fact, all six justices who were present on that case—held that freedom of political discourse was the subject of an implied constitutional protection but that this freedom was not absolute. Their Honours recognised that this freedom, although important, may be subject to more important competing interests such as national security, the administration of justice or other laws necessary in an ordered and democratic society. In order to determine which interests should prevail, obviously a balancing process must take place.

         The court indicated quite clearly that parliament was the organisation which should seek to find that balance in the first instance and that the role of the court would merely be a supervisory one where parliament had exceeded its authority. Justice Brennan in his decision stated:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The balancing of the protection of other interests against the freedom to discuss governments and political matters is, under our Constitution, a matter for the Parliament to determine and for the Courts to supervise.

        The role of the court in judicially reviewing a law that is said to curtail the freedom unduly and thereby to exceed legislative power is supervisory. It declares whether a balance struck by the Parliament is within or without the range of legislative choice. In a society vigilant of its democratic rights and privileges, it might be expected that the occasions when the Parliament deliberately steps outside the range of legitimate choice would be few.

        It is also important to note the judgment of Chief Justice Mason where he says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . only a compelling justification will warrant the imposition of a burden on free communication by way of restriction and the restriction must be no more than is reasonably necessary to achieve the protection of the competing public interest which is invoked to justify the burden on communication.

       <para>
        I think this legislation does just that. The kinds of facts which I and speakers on both sides of this House have discussed—in relation to the burden on the health of Australians and the vulnerability of young people in this regard—more than justify the prohibitions which this act imposes and the further prohibitions sought to be imposed by these amendments.

         However, they do contain a number of exemptions designed to ensure that, where there is a legitimate right of free speech to be exercised by tobacco companies, they are in a position to do so and that the law does not necessarily burden or constrain them in a way which the High Court would find would impinge against the right of political free speech. This is not a US first amendment freedom as such; this is a right of speech which must be balanced against other interests in our society. In this case those interests are overwhelming. They relate to the health of the nation and to public safety. No interest, apart from perhaps national security, could be more important for this parliament to defend.

         When we look at this legislation, it is important to take into account the reasons why we seek to prohibit advertising. It is instructive to look at the undertakings of the tobacco companies themselves. Philip Morris has been the most profitable company in the United States in recent years. Its profitability reaches a staggering level. In 1992 Philip Morris was the seventh largest industrial corporation in the US, with $US50 billion in annual sales.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         However, when these corporations were ranked according to profit, in 1992 Philip Morris, with a profit of $US4.9 billion, made more money than any other company in the United States, which reflects the fantastic level of profits which cigarette manufacturers enjoy. The product is very cheap to produce and, of course, can be sold at quite high prices. With very small increases in the price of the cigarettes, they are able to substantially increase their profit margins even further. But the fact that a company like Philip Morris should be able to turn in a profit of $US4.9 billion trading—as it does—almost exclusively on the health, ill-health and, indeed, the death of individuals in our society, is something which should make this House and this parliament take very strong notice of. I hope that it is an issue which would also weigh very heavily on the justices of the High Court, were it to be required to judge this matter.

         The impact of tobacco advertising is quite significant, and we can follow its trends over recent years. Indeed, in 1925 the average consumption was of the order of 1,000 cigarettes per adult per year, which translates into one pack of 20 a week. That grew very steadily and the main trigger for that growth was World War I.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Over the course of World War I, tobacco consumption went up 1 1/2 times and then fell because of the Great Depression—thus reflecting the economic uncertainties of the times—but then grew steadily again until World War II started in 1940, at which point we were on 2,000 cigarettes per adult per year. However, by the end of World War II, we were up to nearly 3,500 cigarettes per adult per year. From that point onwards, it continued to grow until it plateaued in about 1960-65 at something over 4,000 cigarettes per adult per year—a very substantial growth from 1925 to 1965, from 1,000 to just over 4,000 cigarettes per adult per year.

         That growth was clearly driven by a couple of things: the rise of the mass consumer marketing society which that period reflected very substantially; and the increasing wealth of ordinary people over that period, which was quite a significant factor. Also the contributions of World War I and World War II could not be understated in that context. However, the increase also reflected the increasing power of addiction of those cigarettes.

         Once smokers start that habit, it is very hard to give it up. I have never tried myself, so I cannot comment on the reality of that.

         Consumption remained very high until about the mid-1970s when it began a downward spiral. As at 1990, we had dropped to just below 3,000 cigarettes per adult per year. These figures reflect a number of changes in society as well: the non-smokers rights movement which started back in 1975; the massive increases in federal and state taxes which took place during the 1980s; and the health warnings and the massive publicity given to the health risks associated with tobacco over that period, which resulted in a significant downturn in tobacco consumption.

         Looking at the impact of cigarette advertising, we see that tobacco companies, very wisely from their point of view, focus it quite clearly on young people. It is their intention to secure a market at a very young age, knowing that that will give them consumers for a very long time—consumers who will be quite insensitive to changes in price. If we do not ensure that young people are not caught by the tobacco habit at a very young age, we will never succeed in altering the health and smoking habits of older Australians.

         One of the most striking examples of why we must vigilantly seek to maintain this ban is that of the Camel cigarette company in the United States. It is quite interesting to look at the data from that case. The Camel cigarette advertising campaign clearly has children as its principal target group. In 1988, with Camel sales declining, RJR Nabisco launched a marketing campaign featuring Old Joe Camel—a smooth character, presumably modelled after someone like James Bond. In the adverts, Old Joe rides motorcycles, shoots pool and associates with attractive women while smoking Camel cigarettes.

         The tobacco companies have never ceased to deny the risks associated with tobacco smoking in a way which I think is quite reprehensible. Indeed this has brought about a trend in the United States where the state of Florida has initiated very interesting legislation, which I understand is now being picked up by the United States Congress and which may eventually have to be picked up here. Florida has adopted an amendment to its legislation which insists that cigarette makers can be sued by the state itself for the health costs of tobacco related illnesses. In the case of Florida, it is suing the tobacco companies for reimbursement of about $300 million a year in Medicaid expenses for smoking related illnesses. That legislation is through the Florida parliament, it has been enacted by the governor, and legal cases are already pending in Florida. It represents a very significant legislative change in the way in which these matters are administered.

         If we are to be serious about tobacco control and tobacco legislation, it is essential that we pursue the kinds of advertising regulations and restrictions which this act encompasses. I certainly commend to the House, and indeed at some future point no doubt to the courts, the benefits of this legislation to the Australian people.

        Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to speak again on what the government believes is a historic piece of legislation. I want to begin by again putting on the record the government's motivation in bringing this legislation before the House.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In 1992 the High Court of Australia brought down the historic Mabo decision. That decision changed for all time the position of indigenous people in this country. It recognised that there were still some indigenous people who could trace back their relationship with certain parts of land for time immemorial—long before non-indigenous Australians ever came to these shores. But, as we all now know, the extent of the existence of native title is finite and is, in the government's view, going to be far more limited than was expected when the Mabo decision first came down.
        </tab>

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         To his great credit and the credit of the nation, in the historic Redfern speech made in Redfern park in Sydney, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made it clear that the Mabo decision was to be a historic turning point. He made it clear that it was to be the basis of a new relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, and that it was going to make a very significant contribution to the reconciliation process. The government then put in train a series of consultations and negotiations, which went for an extended period.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As a result of those negotiations, the government developed a three-stage response to the High Court decision in the Mabo case. The first stage was the Native Title Act. That act will remain for all time as one of the great achievements of our federal Labor government. I believe that with the passage of time that legislation and the protection it gives to native title will gain the full endorsement—indeed, the unanimous support—of this parliament. Regrettably, it did not pass through the parliament with that unanimous support on the first occasion, but I am confident that the tide will turn and that, before the end of the decade, unanimous support will be forthcoming. The second stage of the government's response is the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994. I will turn in detail to that in a moment. That bill has been the subject of considerable debate both inside and outside the parliament.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The third stage response has been referred to as the social justice package. That offers both the coalition and the government an opportunity to start afresh. It offers us the opportunity to look at the reports that come from the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, of which the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) is a member. It enables us to look at the report coming in the month ahead from ATSIC and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. Those reports will raise challenging issues for both the government and the opposition.

         Since the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is in the chamber, I want to say to him and the shadow minister, with all the conviction and sincerity I can muster, that the government will be seeking the greatest degree of cross-party support for the way in which we deal with that social justice package. It will raise some very challenging and difficult issues, but I am confident that, if we allow a proper process of consultation and discussion of these issues, we will be able to achieve a large measure of cross-party support.

         The amendments the government is not supporting have been referred to by Senator Evans as the seven deadly sins, and we are not supporting the other amendments for good reason. May I take a bit of the House's time to refer in a measured and considered way to our reasons for not supporting the amendments. The government will be supporting a very large number of amendments and, even as late as yesterday, Senator Evans was prepared to accept another amendment, which was picked up with the motions that were moved this morning. This matter came on for debate in the Senate yesterday. My good friend Senator Teague missed the original vote and, as a further demonstration of the government's bona fides, the matter was recommitted.

         One of the amendments concerns the requirement that priority of land allocation be given to the most disadvantaged in relation to their access to land or to those who are unable to gain substantive title to land. A number of amendments are opposed by the government because we believe they are contrary to the fundamental principles of the bill. For very considered reasons, other amendments are opposed because the government believes that they would make the bill unworkable—and this is one of the amendments the government considers would have that effect.

         I pose the question as to what the definition of access might be. Is it to be defined in some physical sense? In some states and the Northern Territory, guaranteed access to pastoral leases exists in legislation. Can that be compared with the rights conferred by full ownership?

         To the Aboriginal people in New South Wales, I pose the question: is the word `access' to be defined in some structural sense—that is, access to land acquisition programs or possession of legislative rights to claim land, regardless of whether the claim would be successful? If that were the interpretation adopted, Aboriginal people in New South Wales would go to the absolute bottom of the queue.

         There is a further difficulty in relation to people who may be unable to gain substantive title to land. In relation to people who have made a native title or other claim to land which they ultimately may not be able to prove, the question arises as to how they fit into this amendment. There is a great deal of uncertainty which would lead to great difficulties in the operation of the fund.

         Of further concern is the matter of assessing priority in the allocation of land fund moneys.

         I turn now to the issue of grants to individuals and trustees. I ask honourable members to think very seriously about this matter. This amendment was supported by the coalition and by the Greens. Again, we ask the coalition to think very seriously about it. We think it amounts to a radical—I use that word advisedly—and adverse change in relation to Commonwealth grants to indigenous people for the purchase of land. If the parliament carried the opposition's view, it would be the first time in the entire history of Commonwealth legislative action in respect of indigenous people since the 1967 referendum that grants would be made to individual people. We do not think that is good policy. It is certainly not the policy of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The coalition's stated rationale for the amendment is that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be treated like other Australians who are not required to incorporate in order to have title to land. At first blush, that argument has some substance. However, there is a counterargument which we believe ought to prevail; that is, other Australians do not have access to the land fund. This is a special case of positive discrimination designed to address past injustice. The land fund provides an avenue for indigenous people in addition to that which is available to other Australians.

         No-one on this side of the parliament has ever suggested that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should not be free to pursue ordinary means of acquiring land. Please do not suggest or think that we suggest everything for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia must be communal. One of my great hopes, which I am sure is shared by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), is to see an increasing number of entrepreneurial individual Aboriginal people—and I think we are already seeing this—making a success of investment, land ownership and business. But that is not the purpose of this fund. Again, that is one of the reasons why we do not support the amendment.

         The Senate committee established to look into the matter purported to assert that individual ownership was traditionally accepted in some indigenous communities. The committee referred to evidence given by Mr Donald Whaleboat, a Torres Strait Islander. When I looked closely at the evidence given, I found that the Torres Strait Islander was not asserting principles of individual ownership but principles of family ownership. Of course, that is a characteristic of indigenous land ownership in the Torres Strait. In fact, it was precisely the kind of communal or family ownership that was recognised in the Mabo decision itself.

         I turn to the amendment relating to health, education, social and cultural needs. There has perhaps been more public debate on this amendment than any other. The government would agree, as I certainly do, that very much of the debate has been symbolic. The questions we pose are: `What is the amendment intended to specify? How will the needs be assessed? How will we quantify the difference that the land acquisition will make?' Either the needs must be assessed and the benefits quantified—in which case it undermines the whole philosophy behind the bill, which is one of returning the bill—or, if that is not what is meant, it is effectively window-dressing.

There is much work to be done on that.

         I turn to the amendments that relate to the Indigenous Land Corporation pursuing a policy of not requiring any consent for the disposal of land. Of all the issues that are likely to arouse enormous public opposition and public concern in the wider Australian community, it has to be this one. I have to say frankly that the government thinks it very bad public policy that we would allocate funds, perhaps, to an individual person and by law of the parliament effectively give that person a blank cheque authority to be able to dispose of the land the very next day. I pose a challenge for the coalition. I am not aware of any area in any portfolio responsibility in the Commonwealth where there has been such a policy. It has never been coalition policy before.

This is the second stage of the government's response. The third stage will be the social justice package. Before that, in relation to the budget, obviously health will have a high priority.

I would urge the coalition to think again in relation to its past opposition to the government's proposals and to have this legislation passed through today with the unanimous support of this chamber and that of the Senate to achieve the unanimous passage through the Australian parliament that it deserves.

         —Mr Speaker, I enter this debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 for the opposition to say a few words as to our general approach to the whole question of the government's land fund legislation. Let me start by saying that we in the coalition believe very strongly that the amendments that were inserted into the original land fund bill were justified amendments. They would, if adopted by the national parliament, deliver a better land fund, a fairer land fund and a land fund that recognised the rights of individuals as distinct from the rights of groups and corporations.

         Leaving aside any detailed explanation of the constitutional technicalities and the times from which deadlocked provisions begin to operate, quite obviously we have reached a stage where there is a deadlock between the two houses of parliament. The Senate wants a piece of legislation that it believes, and I believe, is superior to that wanted by the government and, clearly, by the House of Representatives. If that deadlock were to continue, the people who would suffer most would be the people the legislation is intended to benefit.

I want to make that very clear: we will amend the legislation to bring it into line with what was resolved by the Senate. It seems to us that that is the most intelligent way of handling this issue. The consequence of that will be that the Aboriginal community will not be denied the benefit of the land fund provisions but, equally, the inadequacies of that legislation will be excised upon a change of government.

         In relation to Aboriginal affairs, no side of politics in Australia has a mortgage on compassion.

         It is not an easy issue. I detect in the Australian community a general desire to see the condition and the state of Australia's indigenous people improved. There is a recognition by most Australians that, as a group of people, Aborigines are clearly the most disadvantaged within our national community. There is also within the Australian community a growing impatience with what seems to it to be the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars, with precious little advancement and, in some cases, actual regression.

That is the fact. If we are to have an intelligent debate about Aboriginal affairs, it ought to focus on issues like that and not be distracted as to who is taking the most morally superior position when it comes to responses to Mabo or responses to the land fund. We can talk for days, for weeks, indeed months, about that and if, as a consequence, the most wretched amongst our number are not advanced or not promoted—

It will never be part of the policy of the Liberal and National parties to see the development of Aboriginal affairs policy within the concept of the tribalisation or fragmentation of this nation.

They need to be given special recognition in law as a result of past injustices about which he spoke. We acknowledged their alienation from their land base by passing the Mabo legislation and, prior to that, the land rights legislation in the Northern Territory; and we are looking at this land fund bill and the social justice package.

What all of them have done is reject the notion that land should be made available to an individual. In fact, they have said—as they have committed themselves to understanding the nature of Aboriginal association with land—that land ownership must be inalienable; it should not be sold; it should not be dealt with in a way in which non-Aboriginal people deal with land.

It says that people should be able to deal with this land—which, after all, is recognition of their spiritual attachment—as if they were real estate agents. They are not real estate agents. I have lived and worked with Aboriginal people for many years and I have not heard one Aboriginal person put this view. We have had the land rights act operating in the Northern Territory since 1976—inalienable freehold title.

         —I rise in support of the very statesmanlike comments made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) with regard to this measure. I want to point out at the outset that we could have done better than have the comments which the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) has just made. He ignores, for example, the contribution of the New South Wales Land Council to this particular debate, which was strongly at variance with the view put by ATSIC. So there is a diversity of opinion amongst Aboriginals with regard to Labor's land fund legislation.

         We are considering this legislation on the eve of another major ruling by the full bench of the High Court of Australia in relation to Mabo. I think in November the High Court finally took oral evidence, and some additional evidence was given after that. I managed to sit in for some of the full bench hearings here in Canberra on the Western Australian legislation and, inter alia, the federal Mabo legislation. The High Court is about to revisit the Mabo issue for the first time since its original decision. I point out to the House that that may well have ramifications for the core Mabo issues. It may necessitate another Mabo bill of one kind or another coming forward from the government. However, that remains to be seen and I am certainly not categorical about that.

In addition to the senators who were members of the committee, a senator for the Northern Territory, Senator Grant Tambling, and others certainly put in a huge amount of effort to bring forward responsible, reasonable amendments which have enjoyed a degree of support. I do not say more than that. I say that those amendments enjoyed a degree of support in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait community. Once in government, we will pursue those amendments and, indeed, will this day vote one more time for them in the deliberations of the House on this measure.

At the end of the day, that is what members on both sides of the House should be about, as those are the real issues of concern. The coalition has taken a very responsible position throughout the course of this debate for reasons that have been well stated by the Leader of the Opposition and, shortly, will be again by the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus).

         —When the government introduced the response to the High Court decision in relation to Mabo, it introduced a bill for an act to give meaning to the notion that there was a basis in the common law of Australia arising from Aboriginal custom and tradition to accept that there was a title available to those who maintain a traditional connection with the land, and to establish who was entitled to that land, how it would be allocated, how it would be decided and what those rights might be. It was thus a historic piece of property in cultural law.

         At the time of its introduction the government made clear that though this established in law a very great principle it would apply to those people who were still able to establish a traditional connection with the land and it would not apply to those who had formerly been dispossessed. Hence we said in the response to the High Court decision, to make clear the government's commitment to justice for Aboriginal people, that we would also introduce a land fund bill that would give Aboriginal people a capacity to buy land, particularly in areas where title may have been extinguished, where there had been a grant of interest for a short period—a pastoral lease or something as we saw recently in events alluded to in the remarks by Justice French. In those circumstances Aboriginal people could actually buy land and they would have a secure title to it. It was and remains a central matter in the dispensing of justice to Aboriginal people.

         The government was determined to get the Mabo bill, the native title bill, through. We stood our ground against intransigence in the Senate, we wore the admonition of the then Leader of the Opposition that it was a day of shame, we withstood the attenuated pressures of the opportunism of the coalition parties in the Senate, and during that period the Western Australian Greens, and said that we would campaign for this, in the country if necessary, were there a failure to pass it. Our determination to get our way, our way being justice for Aboriginal people, paid off for them when the bill was passed at the end of 1993.

         In accordance with the commitment we made we then said we would introduce an Aboriginal land fund bill, and we did this. According to our commitment we proposed that bill to the House of Representatives, and then it went to the Senate in September of last year. From September until yesterday and today the Senate dallied with the bill, behaved opportunistically towards it, sought to undermine the central tenets of it, and then introduced a long, drawn-out process supposedly of consultation which only revealed what a sham process the Senate had embarked upon under the stewardship of the Liberal and National parties and the Western Australian Greens.

         Yesterday, Mr Speaker, the Senate passed the bill, and it passed it with the amendments which the government objected to.

If one is dispossessed, one is dispossessed. The notion that the courts would then be asked to make judgments about these things was, of course, simply only a device and a sleight of hand.

         The second problem with it was that they wanted to see a reference to grants to individuals and trustees being made possible, encompassing the whole notion of the traditional connection of Aboriginal communities with the land, and the protection of that land in the hands of communities being put asunder. The third problem was that another requirement, that grants of interest in land have regard to health, housing and so on, meant that the character of the bill changed from being a land fund bill to an appropriation bill that was interested in health, housing and other things. That completely denied the bill its integrity in terms of dealing with land.

         The fourth problem was that they required the ILC, before acquiring land, to consult with those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who had traditional or historic links to the land in question. The device there was that, without any resolution of some of these issues, the body itself would not be able to conduct its affairs in an executive way. It discusses the removal of the ILC power to control effectively the disposal of land; in other words, it deals with the right of individual people to hold the land and actually dispose of it. It also referred to a group of proposals relating to regional strategies, as though they should in some way impair the capacity of the fund to actually do what we require of it.

You had a chance in the Senate to do justice to Aboriginal people and you did not. You sent the bill back full of these shoddy and appalling amendments. When we faced you up to it, you decided to say today that you would pass the bill but that when you became a government—and if you had your way—you would put all of these amendments back into the legislation. In other words, you would deny Aboriginal people that which this parliament would have given.

         The Leader of the Opposition said that he is taking the decision to pass the bill because of the risk of a deadlock between the houses. Again, I repeat the point to make it clear: he will alter it if he gets into government. He said that he detected in the broad Australian community a desire to solve the problem. He is not about leading in the resolution of the problem; he is only detecting and following a desire to solve the problem. Instead of standing on some principles, he says that he will pass the bill but then if he gets into government he will seek to amend it in ways which would render it completely inoperable.

There has been no virtue on your front bench. Fancy talking about playing politics after your shabby performance. You have done nothing but play politics.

         It will be a great day for Aboriginal people when this bill goes through, and it is getting through because of the resolute strengths of the government to see that justice is done. When the coalition faced up to the fact that the government would take it on and run it up against a double dissolution of parliament and we would propose this at a joint sitting of both houses, it buckled. Aboriginal people will now get their appropriate justice.

I am not surprised at that, considering the number of bills running around at the moment. Let me make this clear: we will not be voting for the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994; we will be voting in support of the amendments moved by the Senate.

He referred to the Senate committee `dallying' in relation to this bill. The committee travelled 12,000 kilometres and listened to 224 people. What did the Prime Minister do? He rushed off to one community. When the second bill is brought down next week, it is with great regret that we will put it through without the amendments asked for by members of the Aboriginal community at large.

This government does not reflect our community; it reflects the community over there.' Aboriginal people are not homogeneous. There are different Aboriginal communities around Australia, and they were excluded by this government from participating in this bill.

         I turn to some of the amendments that we are supposed to be discussing—these so `horrific' amendments. First of all, let us address the so-called health and housing amendment which we are saying is changing the nature of the bill. That amendment says that when the ILC is giving grants to Aboriginal communities buying the land it should look at what is going to happen with that land. Will the people be able to provide housing on the land? Will they be able to provide sealed roads? One of the big problems in Aboriginal health is the dust from the unsealed roads getting into people's eyes. Where there is not sufficient water for continual washing we get infectious diseases.

         That brings up the second point. Should the ILC buy a piece of land where there is no available good ground water—there may be water that is too brackish to use—and where there is no piped water? How is that going to affect the health of the Aboriginal people who move into that community? It means that we are going to see more pictures similar to those that we saw when Graham Richardson went to Central Australia. We saw Aboriginal people living in humpies in a state of health that is reminiscent of Third World countries.

The government has tried to mislead the Australian public by saying that our amendment meant that we would be handing land to individual people. If the government would care to read the amendment it would find that it said that the Indigenous Land Corporation, the body that buys the land, can give the land to corporations—which is in the bill at the moment—or individuals or trusts. It does not say that the ILC has to do this; it simply widens the options.

It has decided that that is what is right for Aboriginal people and to hell with the rest of the community, and to hell with those Aboriginal people who came to us saying, `The government did not consult with us.

         In conclusion, I sum up my reaction as one of incredible disappointment at the way in which the government has decided to use Aboriginal affairs not only as a political football but as a way of scoring political points when out there is one of the most serious problems facing Australia today.

         —The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), appealed to the gallery during her speech. I appeal to the gallery to discount everything it has just heard from the member for Hindmarsh because she has just engaged in a total rewrite of history. Let us not forget that most of the amendments we are discussing here today were amendments that she brought into this House before she had had one ounce of consultation with any Aboriginal people whatsoever.

         One of the major reasons why most of the amendments were rejected by the government in the first place was that she had not engaged in any sort of consultation. In fact, she was told very clearly right across the board that most of her amendments were not acceptable to Aboriginal people. The opposition then set up this farce of a Senate select committee which spent a week at Christmas time running around desperately trying to get a few people in Aboriginal Australia to back its opinions. It did manage to find a few people who would say, `Yes, I agree with this one,' or `I agree with that one.' But the fact is that the Senate has absolutely no expertise in Aboriginal affairs. It is great at bagging Aboriginal people, it is great at knocking ATSIC and it is great at engaging in political campaigns against Aboriginal interests, but it has not done any real hard work on Aboriginal affairs.

         The only really good intensive discussion of Aboriginal affairs in a balanced and reasonable way occurs in this House. We have the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, which has been in existence for 17 years, and which I am proud to be the chair of at this time. It has a long history and, because of the work of that committee, we actually engage in much greater consultation amongst Aboriginal people.

         Over the last five years I have been on that committee, I have visited probably over 100 Aboriginal communities and have spoken to thousands of Aboriginal people—a hell of a lot more than the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs has done.

         I would like to make just one point. The coalition was able to get away with a lot of the amendments it put forward in the Senate only because of the unholy alliance it had with the Western Australian Greens. It greatly disappoints me that the Western Australian Greens were willing to sell their souls to the coalition on this deal. They put this bill through months of delay, forced through the Senate a whole pile of amendments and then did not even have the guts to stand up in the Senate and vote for it. They avoided it. They abstained from the vote. That is how strong their commitment is to Aboriginal people and how strong their commitment is to the amendments. They did not even have the guts to vote on the bill when it went into the Senate. That just shows you exactly what the Greens are worth. It is a worthless organisation, and the miserable two in the Senate at the moment will be decimated at the next election.

         Regardless of the cowardly motives of the opposition in wanting to avoid a double dissolution and facing the people of Australia where they know they are going to be beaten, I am pleased that the coalition has agreed to vote for the second government bill when it comes to the House next Tuesday, because I am sick of the unnecessary delays that have occurred. I am strongly in support of this land acquisition fund. I believe it is a very important new initiative in social justice for Aboriginal people. I just wish the people on the other side would really start talking about accountability and start targeting state and territory governments.

         Let us not forget who has the major responsibility for the provision of health services throughout this country—state and territory governments. Who is responsible for building housing, building roads and putting in water supplies? State, territory and local governments. It is they that have been failing in their responsibilities. The opposition never talks about or accepts that. It comes in here and talks about states rights all the time, but it never talks about states responsibilities. It is about time states responsibilities in Aboriginal affairs started getting an airing in this House.

         —I came into this chamber this morning from the middle of a meeting with a subcommittee of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation where we are working on the council's recommendations to the government for the social justice package. I would like to spend the few minutes that I have available to me this morning perhaps trying to move away a little from some of the hot air, self-righteous indignation and accusations that have been flowing around and talk about some constructive things for our indigenous population.

         I would urge the government to grasp the opportunity that is now clearly before it that this legislation is going to go through the parliament. The fact that we are going to vote against this particular piece of legislation this morning to support our Senate colleagues but have indicated quite clearly that when the second bill comes on next week we will not oppose it gives the government an opportunity not to have to put lots of its effort, energies, time and rhetoric into that piece of legislation but to now turn its attention to doing some constructive things in so many other areas of urgent and desperate Aboriginal need.

         There is no question that we all accept the importance of land to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The way in which that is expressed might vary from person to person or community to community, and there may be different strengths and views within this chamber. But the fundamental recognition is there and the coalition has accepted that principle with this bill throughout.

         I think we also need to be conscious that there are a number of areas where, unfortunately, the government's good intentions—and I accept that the minister has acted with good intentions for a long time in so many other areas of Aboriginal disadvantage, such as health, housing, education, employment and so on—have not borne the fruits that we would all like to have seen. The reality is that health is still a major disaster in this country. The one statistic that comes back to me repeatedly is life expectancy—18 years less for an Aboriginal male born today compared with somebody in the wider community, and for females it is 15 years.

         If we look at the housing situation, we are talking about $2 billion just to catch up on the backlog. If we look at levels of education, we realise it is not just education but it is all interlinked. Health impacts on that as well with so many of our Aboriginal children going to school with middle ear infection that they have not got a hope in either the health or the education stakes. And unemployment is so much worse in the indigenous community.

         We clearly have a number of problems with the ATSIC experiment. Without bucketing, in any sense, ATSIC—and I have been one of its strongest supporters in this place—there are quite clearly a number of areas that need addressing, and the government should be giving it that attention.

         I urge the government in dealing with these matters to go out and consult with the Aboriginal community on a far wider basis than it did with this land bill. I think it has had a tendency to deal with Aboriginal people who are elected to ATSIC, but unfortunately they do not represent the majority. They have dealt with the land councils but there are many others in Aboriginal communities who hold contrary views and who need to be consulted.

         In my role since I have come into this parliament I have been to many of those communities regularly and I can assure the House that although the government is claiming its views are so unanimously supported, that is simply not the case. I am concerned that the government has chosen to take a divisive attitude in so many areas of Aboriginal affairs. To hear the Prime Minister talk about the need for cross-party support and then come in here and say, `Now I am going to pull this second bill, I am going to introduce a third bill next week,' seems to me to be merely trying to take party political advantage.

         I would have thought the interests of indigenous people in this country would have been far better served by accepting that the coalition is going to not oppose the second bill and to then get on with the urgent business of dealing with Aboriginal disadvantage. The government is talking about its three tranches—the native title legislation, the land fund and the social justice package which is upcoming and essentially about rights. They are all important to indigenous people and most people in this chamber accept the principles. But we argue about the implementation.

        As has already been said by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), only a Labor government could deliver legislation to produce this land fund. But, in debating the bill currently before the House, we now turn to amendments which have been agreed to by the government. In doing so, I must emphasise that the government has, once again, shown its bona fides and its good faith in agreeing to some 29 amendments made by the Senate to the land fund bill.

         What we are not prepared to do is agree to amendments which are bad law and that would make, for example, grants to individual people on one day and allow the land to be sold off the next day with a total absence of accountability. However, the 29 amendments that we are accepting is evidence of our commitment to try to achieve the greatest degree of cross-party support.

         The coalition is now indicating that it will support the Prime Minister's bill because of the fear of a double dissolution. As the minister, I welcome the support for whatever reason, although the point about the coalition's motivation, which has been made in a very telling way, shows how scared the coalition is to face a full Senate election.

         Notwithstanding the government's concern on a number of issues about the Senate amendments, we think that the additional operational burdens on the Indigenous Land Corporation are survivable if these amendments are accepted. We believe that one of them—a Democrat amendment—clearly improves the bill. It is the so-called `top-up' amendment, No. 57, which provides that, if at the end of a 10-year period the land fund does not reach the investment target expected of it, an extra amount will be paid from consolidated revenue to top up the land fund. That is a very important guarantee which ensures that after the initial 10 years the fund will be self-sustaining.

         A number of other amendments which the government is prepared to accept are technical ones. For example, the title of the bill has been changed, the minister will be required to table the national strategy in parliament within 15 days of receiving it and the terms and conditions which the Indigenous Land Corporation may impose on a loan is spelt out rather than left to the discretion of the Indigenous Land Corporation.

         Still other amendments have been accepted by us because they do not fundamentally offend the spirit of the bill and, of course, those amendments are incorporated in the new bill that the Prime Minister introduced into the parliament. An example of that would be the provision that the ILC must report to the minister if its obligations not to reveal secret material affects its functions.

         May I clearly point out to the minister sitting at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), that we would like nothing more than to go to an election right now. You know what would happen to you: you would be so far out there that you wouldn't get a look in. Can I say that, as a member with a marginal seat, an election right now would be great, because I can see myself adding to my margin by another 10 to 15 per cent. Let us have no talk about the coalition being scared to go to a double dissolution. The coalition would be delighted to have an election today, tomorrow or whenever you would like.

         Can I also point out that the coalition is more interested in getting this place running properly and having good government rather than having a government that is run by the larrikin that you call a prime minister, who cannot see beyond the cheap political trick. Everything the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says has to be political point scoring, and that is why we are in this state with the government today. When we refer to Aboriginal affairs, after 12 years of this government there are Aboriginal people still living in humpies, dying and without access to water.

         On these amendments that the government has accepted, after they appeared in the House of Representatives the government, through the minister at the table, said, `We will not pass any of these amendments. These are all terrible amendments. We will not touch them with a barge pole. Get them out of here. We will not consider them.' But, lo and behold, what happened when it got to the Senate was that 23 of them were suddenly not so bad after all and the government said, `Okay, we will pass 23 of them.' That is how much you can put on the word of this government: one day they are untouchable amendments; the next day, when they get to the Senate, 23 of them are passed.

         So we have these 23 amendments to which the government agrees. Obviously, we are going to agree to them in the House. One amendment provides that at least two members of the ILC board must have business expertise. We moved that amendment in this House when the bill originally came up, saying that two members of the ILC board must have business experience, otherwise you could have a board with no business expertise running a $1 billion land fund. We put that to the minister in this House and the minister ridiculed it. The minister said, `No way. We will not consider this amendment. It is a terrible amendment.' He could not tell us why, of course. What has happened? It has come back from the Senate and the government has agreed with that amendment because it is obviously essential. What does that tell you about the minister sitting at the table and his ability to judge this area correctly and to be sincere in the area?

I was shocked and horrified to hear an appalling statement by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard).

         Today, the Leader of the Opposition came into this House and said, `We don't agree with this. We supported the holding up of the legislation in the Senate for all this time, but we don't want a double dissolution, so we're going to let this go through.' And he confidently said, `When we get into government.' I do not believe that confidence is based on a great deal. A week is a long time in politics, and the next few weeks will show the difference.

He said, `We are going to vote for this legislation and, if we become the government, we are going to vote it out again.' What can the people of this country expect? They can expect the same sort of shillyshallying that they got from the former leader over other aspects of Aboriginal policy.

         In this debate, once again, the opposition has no planned policy on Aboriginal affairs. Opposition members get up and criticise us because we have not been able to fix the wrongs of 200 years. But we have demonstrated a commitment to righting the wrongs of 200 years. It is indeed the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who has shown true leadership on this issue.

         In response to the motion on the previous amendments, the Leader of the Opposition said, `We're not in the guilt industry.' I want to comment on this issue because these land fund measures are about Australia taking responsibility for its past. As a collective, all the present citizens of this country have a collective responsibility for past wrongs just, indeed, as I hope we would see that Germany has a collective responsibility for its wrongs done to minorities during the Second World War and just as we would expect the Japanese to have a collective responsibility for the wrongs done to our POWs.

Having thanked her, I must refer to her statement that the government has demonstrated its commitment. The government has demonstrated its commitment to failure of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. If we look at the areas of health, education, housing and employment—everywhere we look—it is a record of failure.

         The government has been in office for 12 years. What has happened in those 12 years? Aboriginal men still have a life expectancy 18 years less than me. In fact, probably almost every Aboriginal man born the year that I was born is dead already. That is the likelihood, and that is a disgrace and a shame. Aboriginal women have 15 years less life expectancy than my wife. How can we, and my friends on the other side of the House, talk about responsibility, commitment and guilt? If there is to be any guilt in this parliament today it is guilt for the inactivity and failure of the last 12 years—not for the last 200. We have to be concerned about what is happening now and in the future. We should learn from the past, but we cannot live there—we have to go forward.

It has taken out injunctions to stop the Ombudsman's report going to this minister, the Prime Minister and this parliament.

         —by leave—I rise to make a statement about shipping in and around our unique national treasure, the Great Barrier Reef. Presently, ships use two routes to traverse the reef. What is known as the inner route travels from the Torres Strait in the north, to Gladstone in the south. The alternative route—the outer route—commences in the Prince of Wales Channel, leaves the Torres Strait at Bligh Entrance, and continues southwards through the Coral Sea to Sandy Cape, just south of Gladstone.

         The most hazardous parts of the reef to navigate are in the Torres Strait and in the northern section of the inner passage. Narrow channels, strong tides and the presence of fishing boats all enhance the risk of a grounding. Furthermore, in the case of the outer route, the process of skirting the reef and the largely uncharted waters pose a similar risk of grounding. With some 87 million tonnes of international trade—mostly Australian exports—shipped through the region annually, this ever present danger is a matter of great concern.

Last September I announced new administrative procedures for issuing single voyage permits to foreign vessels. This places an obligation on shippers to undertake thorough safety checks before chartering foreign vessels. This condition came into effect this week. In addition, shippers applying for permits involving bulk carriers and all types of tankers must now certify vital information on the condition of the ship, as well as the qualifications of its crew.

In order to improve the charting of the outer reef, I can today announce that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA, will provide funding for the production of these charts. The task will involve surveying that will begin at Bramble Cay in the eastern approaches to the Torres Strait and go down the Queensland coast to the end of the reef just north of Fraser Island, a total distance of some 2,000 kilometres. Once this charting is done, those vessels not calling at Queensland ports that currently use the inner route, will, unless there are exceptional circumstances, have absolutely no reason to do so.

Extended coverage of this radar traffic system will provide accurate real time information and reduce the prospect of ship collision and groundings. This will be a vast improvement on the present situation where authorities rely on positions radioed in from vessels.

The reason the minister is bringing this into the House today is that, whilst it would seem logical to have all ships go outside the reef, other than those ships which have to call in to ports along the reef, there have been concerns that the shipping lanes outside, to the east of, the reef have not been adequately charted.

         Many old salts will tell you that the original charting that was done many years ago was done very poorly; some, apparently, was not done at all. A lot of the navigational aids are very old and not up to the task today. Of course, that has been a concern, because, if you do not have properly charted waters so that you can be confident that ships can plough through those waters without running into anything, it is probably safer to have ships going inside the reef where there are proper charts. With proper navigational aids and compulsory pilotage, that was probably safer than going outside the reef, at the time.

         The compulsory DGPS through the Torres Strait is really an essential element. I have actually taken a boat, many years ago now, through the Torres Strait, and at that point you get the Indian and Pacific oceans meeting. You get currents that clash at that point—they go in different directions—you get whirlpools; it is really quite dramatic if you go through that part of the world in a boat. It is a very dangerous waterway. The channels are very narrow, those channels are quite shallow as well, and there is quite a lot of shipping that goes through. So it is really vital that, if we are to advance the cause that all of us in this House support, we get that international agreement, if you like, with compulsory DGPSs for ships going through that part of the world.

         Many of us, as I said earlier, have taken a long and deep interest in this issue. I have visited the oil spill centre in Geelong. For anybody who has an interest in this matter and who has not visited that centre, I think it is a very worthwhile thing to do. It is sponsored by the oil companies. It is one of our front-line defences if we do have an oil spill. That reminds me of the Auditor-General's report No. 9 of 1994-95, which was tabled some time ago now. That report looked into our ability to respond to a major oil spill, and in the process identified the Great Barrier Reef as a high risk area. I quote from the report's conclusion:

       <para>
        This is something that we need to be looking at also, that we must have the equipment necessary to ensure that we can deal with a major oil spill in this part of the world. The downside to travelling outside the reef is that, if you do have an oil spill occurring at that point, the winds and the currents along that coastline are such that you actually will drive the oil, or whatever chemical spills out of the ship, across the entire width of the reef, whereas, as happened in the past, where you come up through the middle of the reef you run the risk of putting oil over only half of the reef, if you like. That is a simple analogy, but it is roughly right.

         By going outside the reef we do increase the area potentially affected by an oil spill, so it is important that we also do what we can to ensure that we have got oil spill recovery facilities to ensure that if something does go wrong we can do our very best to mop it up. The one thing that we all worry about, apart from the ecological damage, is the television news reports around the world that would display our Great Barrier Reef in a very poor light, and it would do our tourism industry a great deal of harm. We all have memories of the

So we really need to make sure that whatever oil spill response we have is adequate to the task ahead of us, and from the Auditor-General's view there is some doubt that we have adequate equipment to meet that task.

It is amazing to see the number: hundreds, in fact, and many of them on the Great Barrier Reef. It is worth making the point that, just because there is an accident at sea with an oil spill, it does not necessarily mean the end of the world: the oil can evaporate and break up, and the reef can recover. There has been a tremendous amount of oil spilt on the reef, particularly during the Second World War, so all of these things need to be taken into account.

         —by leave—In my last annual report to parliament on the aid program, which I tabled at the end of 1993, I set out the government's approach to poverty alleviation through its aid program. In that report, I emphasised the importance of sustainable economic growth and social development proceeding in tandem. The report I am tabling today highlights significant new directions in Australia's aid program in the social sector and in the area of humanitarian relief. The report also covers the major achievements of the aid program over the past 12 months, and I shall begin my comments by outlining some of the most important of these achievements.

         Despite the need for continued budgetary restraint in order to consolidate the economic recovery in Australia, the government demonstrated its commitment to international development by increasing Australia's aid program by 3.6 per cent in real terms. This meant that we were one of only four of the 21 OECD donors who increased their aid programs in the last year. As a result, Australia continues to remain above the average for donors in terms of the aid to GNP ratio. Aid volume apart, there have been significant changes in our region, not least in Indochina and the South Pacific. Further afield, the transition to democracy in South Africa will change the nature of economic relationships throughout southern Africa.

         I draw attention now to significant developments in Australia's relationship with the South Pacific. During the run-up to the South Pacific Forum—which was held in Brisbane in August last year—I gave a speech to the Foreign Correspondents Association, highlighting the need for policy reforms in the region. The overriding theme of my address was the need for the region's governments to develop improved national policies to encourage sustainable social and economic growth. I am pleased to say that this theme was taken on board by regional leaders and, as a result, the forum generated an unprecedented level of commitment to improve economic and environmental policies, particularly in forestry.

In Papua New Guinea, we have agreed on a radical transformation of the aid program. By the end of the decade, the program will have completely moved from budget support to jointly programmed project activities.

It is the first road link between Laos and Thailand and will yield substantial economic benefits to both countries.

         I wish to draw members' attention to the government's response to the tragedy of Rwanda. The government has so far contributed $35 million to support the relief effort there, a contribution matched by an extraordinary public response of over $30 million. Australia's response was one of the earliest and, from my observations, one of the most effectively targeted of all donors. At the same time, and despite our limited resources, we have begun an increased program to support the peaceful transition to majority rule in South Africa by providing assistance of $30 million over three years. This program has been designed to meet the objectives of the Government of National Unity's reconstruction and development program, including through building up capacity in areas such as planning, economic policy and the media.

         There have also been important developments in the sector focus of Australia's aid program. In particular, we have continued to expand environmental assistance, and in this financial year, we will spend around $120 million on these activities. Amongst other things, this funding will cover the establishment of what we are calling `Green DIFF', part of the highly successful development import finance facility which has been the catalyst for many Australian companies to become involved in the region. Green DIFF will help to finance environmental projects in areas such as pollution control and energy efficiency, gaining wider exposure for Australia's environmental expertise. The last budget also heralded an Australian contribution of nearly $43 million to replenish the global environment facility, as well as an increase in support for the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.

         A vibrant private sector is an essential part of the development process. Initiatives such as the private sector linkages program, which last year saw its budget allocation double to $10 million, are targeted at this sector. In addition, the informal sector is now recognised as a fundamental resource for social and economic development. Australia's aid program is reflecting this with an increased allocation of funds to micro-enterprise development, with a two-year $1.3 million package for development in the South Pacific and South-East Asia.

         I would now like to turn to new developments in our overseas assistance in the social sector.

         The social sector provides a crucial contribution to sustainable social and economic development. Recent World Bank reports have highlighted the major role that government commitment to social sector development, particularly in education, has played in the rapid growth of many Asian economies. Reflecting this importance, the past two budgets have seen a significant upgrading of the already high priority given to the social sector in the aid program through the introduction of major population and health initiatives.

         In the 1993-94 budget, we trebled expenditure on the population sector with a four-year, $130 million initiative. To ensure the effectiveness of this initiative, the government commissioned an independent inquiry into the links between population and development. This was one of the most comprehensive surveys of population and development issues ever undertaken, and its conclusions have been vital in highlighting the complex links between population and development.

         The results of this inquiry have helped AIDAB to develop a range of principles which now guide our aid program's population activities. Among the most important of these principles is that access to safe and effective family planning services is a fundamental right, and that women should have access to a wide range of reproductive health services and should participate fully in defining the services they need. Above all—and I want to emphasise this as much as I can—coercion has no place in the Australian aid program's family planning activities.

         I would also like to refer to the significant developments in the nature of our assistance to the health sector. Funding for health was given a major boost in the 1994-95 aid budget, with the introduction of a four-year initiative targeting four priority areas: malaria, polio, neonatal tetanus and HIV-AIDS. This initiative involves additional funding of $110 million over the next four years, which nearly doubles Australia's current spending on health under the aid program.

         As with our assistance to the population activities, AIDAB has developed a set of principles which will guide this new funding.

         Changes are also afoot in Australia's program of assistance to education and training. It is true that assistance to the education sector has always been a large part of the aid program. At present, the sector receives an allocation of a little under 20 per cent of the total budget. The majority of that funding goes towards assistance at the tertiary level. We are now reviewing our assistance in this sector with a view to diversifying the kinds of assistance to include increased support for basic, technical and vocational education.

         There is no doubt of the social, economic, health and population gains that are derived from basic education. At the same time, the primary responsibility for the provision of basic education lies with the recipient government—aid should not substitute for that responsibility. That means that our assistance to the education sector must be carefully targeted to assist and strengthen, rather than replace or duplicate, the efforts of national governments.

         Finally, I would like to talk about developments in the humanitarian relief program. One of the most tragic features of the past few years has been the continued increase in the frequency and the impact of international emergencies. In the past five years, over 300 million people have been affected by natural disasters and civil strife. Over the past 20 years, the number of refugees has risen from an estimated three million to 23 million, half of whom are children and most of whom are from developing countries.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That is a huge cost in human terms. It is also a huge financial cost. Just to give two examples: the annual expenditure of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has risen from $US450 million in the mid-1980s to $US1.1 billion in 1993, and the cost of UN peacekeeping operations has risen from under $US1 billion in 1991 to over $US4 billion in 1993. And it is tragic that this trend shows no sign of slowing.

         The forces which drive this situation are highly complex and demand an equally complex international response. Factors such as the link between poverty and vulnerability, the increase in political volatility since the end of the Cold War and the proliferation of humanitarian relief agencies have to be taken into account in providing a coordinated response. It was against this backdrop of increasing complexity and growing demand for assistance that early last year AIDAB undertook an extensive review of its refugee and relief program.

         The results of this review are helping the government to update Australia's response to international humanitarian emergencies. The review found that Australia's spending on humanitarian relief had not followed the rapid increases of other donors. This relative decline in funding for humanitarian emergencies is in stark contrast to the clear wishes of the Australian public, which has repeatedly demonstrated that it wants our government to respond generously to such humanitarian tragedies as those witnessed in Rwanda. AIDAB is already responding to the recommendations of the review and is also exploring opportunities for increasing funds for humanitarian relief.

         As Australia improves its aid response to international humanitarian emergencies, we also share a responsibility with the international community to do more to prevent disasters and complex emergencies from happening in the first place. This is a priority that requires a range of strategies addressing the underlying causes of dispute and conflict. We require improvements in prevention and response strategy through arrangements which minimise threats to security, promote confidence and trust, and create frameworks for dialogue and cooperation. We must also develop peace-building activities to ensure that conflict does not arise in the first place or, if it does, to ensure that it does not recur. That involves strategies which encourage economic and social development, environmental protection, human rights and good governance. Australia will be doing as much as possible through the aid program to support these activities.

As I think the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) would be aware, on this side of the House we believe that the purpose of foreign aid is to provide for basic needs in two respects: first, in terms of humanitarian assistance; and, secondly, in terms of assisting with sustainable economic growth.

         It is important, though, in the context of this debate to outline what aid should not be. It should not be some kind of high level bribery or foreign policy instrument which is cynically used to advance a political interest rather than to advance those basic needs that I spoke of earlier. Secondly, aid should not be used as a way of circumventing GATT rules on international trade and subsidising exports. That is not what our aid program is supposed to be about, and in too many countries around the world aid programs are used for those objectives rather than the fundamental objective of the provision of basic needs.

         I wish to address three or four of the issues that arose from the minister's statement. The most controversial issue involves how much aid the government provides.

That statement is completely disingenuous and the minister knows that it is.

         So the government set a standard, recklessly and deceptively, knowing that it would never achieve it. What it has achieved is 0.34 per cent—from my recollection of last year's budget, that was the figure. It would just about crack 0.33 per cent, in fact.

Why did it try to get the votes of the aid groups in the community and of all those Australians who are interested in aid—which is quite a lot of people—by telling them one thing and doing another? You can get away with it once, but you will not get away with it twice.

         What about the government's performance against the standards of the rest of the world? Interestingly enough, it was AIDAB which gave me these very good charts. Here is one which deals pretty effectively with the minister's claim that somehow Australia has performed well by OECD standards. This chart shows movements in aid to GNP ratios, conveniently from 1982-83 to 1993—over the life of the Labor government. Of all the countries on the OECD Development Assistance Committee, Australia comes second last. Only the United States has a worse record than Australia in that period. That information was given to me yesterday by AIDAB.

The government should not say one thing and turn around and do another. The minister claimed in his speech that Australia is above the average for donors in terms of aid to GNP ratios. That is funny. The information from AIDAB shows the unweighted average and the weighted average in 1983. Obviously, the unweighted average should be used. In 1983, Australia was not far above the average, but we were above it. Today, according to AIDAB, we are there and the average is there. It is way below.

Against the standards of the previous government, I do not really need to elaborate, except to say that in 1982-83, when we were above the OECD weighted and unweighted averages, Australia's aid was 0.5 per cent of GNP. During the life of the Fraser government, we had a record that has never been closely matched by the Hawke and, of course, now Keating governments.

The second point, though, is in relation to educational assistance and development. The government and the minister claim that nearly 20 per cent of the total aid budget is spent on education.

In the ASTS scheme, the recipient government nominates students, who are usually officials in key positions in that country's public sector, to study in Australian tertiary institutions.

Obviously, we have to avoid hurting people who are the innocent victims of regimes which show no respect for human rights. That is a very important point to make. The answer I suppose is to decrease the reliance of government to government aid in those circumstances and to increase aid delivery to the community level through AIDAB and non-government organisations.

That has been the rhetoric of the government and, on many occasions, certainly the activity of the government. However, the government has suspended aid to Burma until the SLORC makes clear-cut reforms. Is the government, in rejecting any link between aid and human rights, turning around and saying that it has a different policy in relation to Burma? Or is it conceding that there is a role for human rights and decisions about aid volumes and directions? The government cannot have it both ways. I think the government needs to make its position on that issue much clearer than it is at the moment.

         The government has shown a great deal of enthusiasm for increasing aid to Vietnam. When the Prime Minister visited Vietnam, he announced a very substantial increase in aid. That country, which is now by far the largest recipient of Australian aid in Indochina, does not have a great record on human rights. Vietnam's record on human rights has not been of much concern to the government. But, quite rightly, the government has been concerned with Burma's record on human rights. The government needs to think through—as I think it does generally with its foreign policy—a lot more carefully where human rights fit into its aid policy so as to articulate a clear and coherent policy. Then those opposite can escape from charges of hypocrisy as everybody will know where they stand. The problem with so much of this debate about aid is that the rhetoric comes out to suit the moment, but the principles underlying the policy are never clear.

We have been concerned about some of the massive infrastructure projects, of which I spoke earlier. We have to be very careful about the way in which those things are handled.

Obviously, you cannot be trusted in relation to the amount of aid provided. It does not matter what you say before the next election because, in the unlikely event of your getting re-elected, what you actually do will be totally at variance with what you say. Forget making any promises on that front, because nobody will believe them. If you address some of those other issues, I think the aid program might start to come together a little more coherently.

Having said that, in relation to a number of concerns raised with or by the committee, where strong or different views were firmly held by individual members of the committee, the committee endeavoured to be of most assistance to the House by seeking to find as much common ground as possible and openly make on-balance judgments and leave some issues for consideration by the Attorney-General and debate in the parliament.

          I deal in turn with some principal issues raised about the bill which the committee has examined in some detail. The first concern was whether the division of proprietary companies into small and large companies as proposed by the bill be adopted, or whether a reporting entity test proposed by the accounting bodies be adopted. The committee found this a difficult matter to resolve.

          The committee concluded on balance that the test proposed by the bill should be adopted, as the reporting entity test does not provide a test of sufficient certainty to allow an objective assessment to be made of whether a company falls within the reporting entity test when compared with the small-large distinction provided in the bill. Particularly in view of the Australian Securities Commission submission that the test in the bill provides a simple and objective test which, from a regulator's and a company's view point will not lead to any uncertainty about whether the requirement to lodge accounts applies, the committee concluded that the small-large test be supported over the reporting entity test. By way of aside, I should make the point that on this issue Senator McGauran has provided the House with a dissenting report.

          The second concern was whether the criteria proposed in the bill for distinguishing between small and large proprietary companies be adopted in whole or in part. The test proposes that a company would move from a small to a large proprietary company when it had two out of the following three criteria: more than 50 employees, a gross operating revenue of more than $10 million, and assets of more than $5 million.

          The simplification task force indicated that the effect  of using a one out of three test would cause more companies than desirable to fall within the large company category. The practical effect of setting up a one out of three test would negate the intended effect of the scheme, namely, to reduce the unnecessary regulatory burden on small business. The task force also indicated that the effect of setting up a three out of three test would be to impose an unnecessarily restrictive test which would undesirably limit the number of large companies that would be obliged to prepare accounts.

          The committee has found the resolution of questions about an appropriate test for defining a small or large proprietary company extremely difficult.

The committee believes these two tests must be included in criteria for distinguishing small from large proprietary companies.

          The committee was much less convinced that a necessary test for distinguishing a small company was whether a company has more than 50 employees. The committee was unable to reach an unqualified view on the test, and believes that the Attorney-General should give serious consideration to two options, namely, that the 50 employees criterion should remain, or that the test of more than 50 employees be deleted from the bill and the test for a small-large proprietary company be on the proposed assets and turnover criteria.

          The third concern was whether a register of debenture holders as provided in the bill should be public. The committee considered that convertible debentures should be treated in the same manner as shares and options and that the bill not be changed so far as it relates to convertible debentures. However, there seems to be insufficient reason to automatically treat other debentures in the same manner. The committee recommends that a register be kept of debentures, other than convertible debentures, but that access to the register should be subject to the same Australian Securities Commission power of exemption as at present, together with the privacy regime implemented by the bill.

          A range of other issues were considered in some detail by the committee. One was the number of shareholders and directors in a proprietary company. In relation to the creation of single member proprietary company, as proposed by the bill, the committee has accepted that there should be  single member companies. This change will particularly do away with the perennial problem of two-person companies where a company has two directors, with one director an `active' director, and another director—often a spouse or partner—a `silent' director.

The committee believes the inclusion of the guide in the Corporations Law is an innovative measure, and considers that any risk it poses is outweighed by the benefits it promises. The committee has, however, recommended that inclusion of the guide in the act itself be subject to review by the Attorney-General after it has been in operation for a reasonable time.

As part of its statutory duties to monitor the national scheme laws, the committee has monitored the establishment and progress of the simplification process and the consultative process which that has involved. The committee is conscious that, due to its extensive nature, the consultative process will occasionally give rise to provisions that do not meet the approval of all groups in the process.

Indeed, the committee is strongly of the view that the process followed by the task force is a great improvement on past practice and supports its continuation. The committee will continue to monitor the simplification and consultative process as part of its role of scrutiny of the administration and development of the national corporate law scheme.

          —by leave—I came to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities as a newly appointed member after the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill had been introduced into the House. My initial concern, as I said at the time, was that one of the intended consequences of the bill could well have been that the Labor Party would have the opportunity of no longer filing accounts for its operative companies which deal with its money, finance its elections and deal with its property. I set those concerns out in my speech in the second reading debate.

          When I came onto the committee and started to look at the bill in totality, I saw that there were some matters of quite considerable concern that needed to be investigated to a greater extent. The report as it is being presented today, recommending that the legislation be passed, has dealt with some of the concerns in a satisfactory way, but some remarks need to be made to indicate that there are ongoing concerns which may have to be dealt with in the future.

          Clearly, the most contentious issue was the decision to introduce a new test for which proprietary companies should be required to lodge their accounts and returns with the Australian Securities Commission and which companies should not. This is not a novel proposition in that the situation already exists where companies are broken into those required to file and those not required to file. The old test was the exempt and non-exempt test—a complicated test. The simplification process should be commended, but there are some examples in the bill where, in an attempt to simplify, we are perhaps slipping into some shoddy practices. The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) may address some of those in his remarks, as he made the point quite well during the committee hearing. There are one or two others as well.

          To turn to the most contentious issue: the introduction of the new test of when you shall be required to file accounts and when you shall not be required to file accounts is now known as the small-large test. That means that, under the current bill, if you are a company and you meet two out of three criteria set down in the bill, you will be excused from filing your accounts. I asked: why were these three criteria chosen? What sort of evidence was presented to the consultative group or, indeed, to us as members of the committee that said that this is a good way to proceed? Or did somebody just wake up one day and say, `This looks like a good idea'?

          The answer seems to be that there was a paper prepared for the consultative group. In evidence the chairman of that group—and he spoke with the committee—said that there is such a test in operation in the United Kingdom and New Zealand and he thought in Canada but he could not remember.

          Upon further inquiry it became apparent that the United Kingdom had the two out of three test, but New Zealand, which has more recently introduced a test for large and small, has a two out of two test. The chairman of the committee has already addressed the fact that we had a large number of submissions dealing with a different form of test altogether. But once the committee had decided that it was interested in recommending the large-small test, the question of what criteria should be met became a focus.

          It is important to say that what became apparent is that the system we are introducing has been lifted from the United Kingdom system.

On this very point, I feel that perhaps we should have been in a position to do a more thorough job.

         If your company complies with two out of the three criteria, you are excused. That is the position in the United Kingdom. The New Zealanders have said that, if you have consolidated operating revenue for the financial year of a set sum of dollars, around $10 million, or if the value of your gross consolidated assets at the end of the year is less than a certain figure—we say $5 million; they have a figure of their own—then you are excused from filing.

You would have to file. But if you decided to fire 15 employees or of the 60 people you had working for you only 45 were employees, the rest were casual, contract labour or the like, you could drop one of the really substantive tests and say, `We have got fewer than 50 employees, so we are excused.

          I think that is a test which militates against employment and against allowing sunshine onto the accounts and the affairs of corporations.

That was cleared up later. But the bottom line is that it remained a matter of some confusion as to why it was the right or the wrong decision.

          A couple of other things were quite important. There was an effort originally to show that the professions that were affected by this legislation were all gung-ho and in favour of it. That is not true either. The Law Council of Australia was split. The insolvency committee said:

        </para>

         To suggest to people in business that certain advantages are available only while their companies remain "small" is short sighted and counter-productive.

         However, the corporate committee of the Law Council of Australia thought it was a great test. So there is confusion in the ranks. The Institute of Chartered Accountants and the CPAs said they did not like the test and wanted another test. There is still a lot of debate out in the community.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The other thing it is important to say is that, whilst we are introducing simplified legislation, let us do what we say. We are moving to have legislation that says when Fred Smith, businessman, or Joanna Smith, businesswoman, picks up a piece of legislation, he or she can see what it really means. But, still, in the body of the drafting we have definitions by implication. We have a list that we have defined within the body of the legislation as to who can be a proprietary company, who is eligible to be subject to the large-small test and who is not. A public company cannot be a proprietary company; but we do not say what it is to be a public company.

          A note to me this morning from the corporations law simplification program said that there will be another bill coming in. I look forward to that. By implication, the bill defines what you have to be to be a proprietary company. If you do not fit that, you are a public company. But then there is an additional definition saying that a company which is limited by both shares and guarantee may not be a proprietary company. That is new, but it makes it clear. I think it would have been sensible to add that a company that is limited by guarantee alone is also a public company. Somebody who picks up the legislation could then clearly read it rather than having it implied from the new section 116 which, by implication, defines a public company.

          This bill is a good start and the work of the committee of this House is going to be more important as we proceed. One of the implicit difficulties with moving to plain English in an attempt to simplify the law is that you can create uncertainty instead of certainty. By moving away from certain set legal phrases which have defined meanings we could move to new phrases which have undefined meanings; and uncertainty can result. That is why I felt very sympathetic to Mr Tanner who has concerns about putting the small business guide into the act.

          This is a beginning. I commend the idea of making law readily available to people because I have a fundamental problem with the concept that the law shall be the law by which we are bound but ordinary folk find it incomprehensible. For the same reason, I hope to goodness that one day we will move to some sensible simplification in the area of tax law. But at least in this area we have begun, with the requirement that the Australian Securities Commission will now flag its guidelines as to when it will require additional proprietary companies to file. We are starting to see some accountability return in that area as well.

          —by leave—I, too, applaud the work of the corporations law simplification task force and also the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in heading down this path to simplification of the Corporations Law. I will make a couple of comments on some of the matters raised by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop). With respect to the absence of any reference in our report to the company being limited by guarantee, we have a difference about that. In my view the position is perfectly clear elsewhere in the legislation, in section 116, which she referred to. It was unnecessary for us to make reference to that. This issue, to the extent that it will be dealt with in any way by simplification processes, will be dealt with in a subsequent bill. It should be noted that this is the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1994 and deals only with certain sections of the law.

          I would also like to refer to the question of the so-called small-large test and, in particular, the limb with respect to 50 employees. I disagree with the suggestion of the member for Mackellar that that militates against employment. I think it is beyond comprehension that any company will be so motivated to avoid the need to report or to file returns that it would dismiss employees or go through all sorts of convoluted arrangements in order to bring itself below the 50 employees. I do not agree with that concern.

        <para first-indent="16">

          However, it is fair to say, as the committee reported, that this particular limb of the test is clearly of lesser importance than the other two limbs. That is, in my view, primarily because it is actually less certain when you consider factors like having full-time and casual employees who may work only every now and then—every few weeks or every few months. Clearly, it is less certain than the other tests with respect to assets and turnover. For that reason, the committee has reported that the Attorney-General should give consideration to the merits of this particular limb of the test.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          However, the broader point that does prevail on this issue is: where do you draw the line? At one end of the spectrum, we have large proprietary companies that should be filing accounts and reporting. That is obviously in the community's interest. At the other end of the spectrum, we have very small companies for which filing accounts and reporting is an onerous obligation and one that really does not serve any great community or public purpose, but puts the people who are running those companies into expense and difficulty. What we are seeking to do here is to meet two ultimately competing imperatives, and in the middle there are companies in a borderline situation where it would be difficult to have an obvious answer as to whether or not they should report.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The trick is to develop a test that is certain. The reason that we ultimately supported the simplification task force's test, rather than the so-called reporting entity test as proposed by the chartered accountants, was the greater certainty of the simplification task force's proposed test. A test should also have companies falling on the right side of the line, depending on whether it is in the public interest that they report or not report.

          The ironic thing about the view expressed by the honourable member for Mackellar is that—given that she has, in the past, put herself forward as a strong defender of the rights of small business—if it were actually enacted, it would lead to at least some small businesses who, under the task force's regime, would not have to report actually being included and having to report. They would then be faced with the problem of additional expense, paperwork and a bigger bureaucracy. The intention of this legislation is to relieve that burden. Although I do not question the motives of the honourable member for Mackellar, I think an unfortunate consequence of her position—or one that may well be—is that people in small business are actually exposed to a greater obligation of unnecessary, at least in some instances, reporting and providing accounts.

          The final comment I make is with respect to a matter that the honourable member for Mackellar gave me glowing praise for, which, no doubt, I will find difficult to live down—that is, the issue of the small business guide and its inclusion within the legislation. It is fair to say that this is something of an unusual or innovative step in that a document which purports to be advice about the content of legislation and about what it means—a user's guide—is actually being incorporated as part of the act of parliament.

          At first blush that offended my notion of what an act of parliament is about. In my view, it is there to create obligations, rights and laws that apply to all of the community; it is not to advise the community about what the law actually is. There are some inherent dangers in that with respect to both judicial interpretation of the law and the rights and obligations of professionals who are advising users of the law. A blurring of the distinction between an act of parliament and advice about an act of parliament is a worry.

          However, in the spirit of cooperation, I have been prepared to give this the benefit of the doubt. Therefore, I feel that the committee's recommendation that the Attorney-General review the operation of this section of the legislation, at a subsequent point, is worth while. I would like to place on record that, if this type of approach to the process of legislation is to spread to other areas, I may not be quite so generous.

It worries me that we have identified in this advisory report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill the share buyback provisions, for example, more on the number of words than on the degree to which they are understandable. Not only is simplification something that is needed but also it is a matter of consolidating the law.

It is essential that, if law is to be changed, those who are practitioners in the field are consulted so that it is not just a matter of modification within the Public Service in Canberra. In that sense the reference to the committee was valuable, although it is very difficult with the sort of inquiry that we made to take account of the views of those who operate proprietary companies, as they are now formed in the exempt category, and to be sure that the new requirements meet the bill.

          For my part, I would have preferred to follow the New Zealand practice and thereby have only two obligatory criteria.

In the report itself we have left the conclusion on that point a little ambivalent. For my part, I am not at all ambivalent; I think it would be far better if we excluded that criterion relating to the number of employees and maintained the requirement that all companies who exceed the gross operating revenue and the assets test figures that are set in the bill to file their accounts.

          I believe that the recommendations of the insolvency committee of the Law Council of Australia, which suggested there was still an advantage in retaining two directors, should have been followed. In part, this is because I have always felt that it is necessary to distinguish a company from an individual and, to the degree to which you make a company identical, I think there is a disadvantage. For all that we refer to sexually transmitted debt in the text of the report, it is my view that having two directors places a greater obligation on an individual running a corporation. I think it would have been preferable to have taken the view of the insolvency committee of the Law Council in that respect.

There was considerable debate in the committee about the reporting entity test which was favoured by the Society of Certified Practising Accountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and by others who gave evidence to the committee. Mr Leigh Hall, the chairman of the consultative group, suggested that he at one stage had also been in favour of that reporting entity test to distinguish between small and large companies.

          My own view is that it becomes too confusing, and it was on that basis that I accepted the alternative. While I wanted to mention that dissenting report, the majority of the committee certainly felt that the reporting entity test was too confusing and, therefore, should not have been followed. At the same time, I repeat my assertion that the legislation would have been far better if only two of the three requirements now included in the present bill before the House were required. They are that the asset and turnover tests should be appropriate, as in New Zealand, instead of providing the opportunity for the number of employees also to be taken into account.

          It is important that we simplify legislation. At the same time, when there are changes as fundamental as these and when concerns have been expressed, as they have been, I would hope that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) does not feel that the legislation is necessarily written in stone. It is legislation that needs to be reconsidered from time to time. I hope that when the subsequent reports from the consultative group are before this chamber, we might have an opportunity to perhaps review some of the matters and their practice in the report that is now being adopted into the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill and that, ultimately, we might have a consolidated piece of legislation which would be of far more use to the practising public.

          Along the lines of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), I purely want to add my caution to some of the developments that have come out of the report. Simplification is a very desirable path. Those who work in company law or in taxation law will know that in the last few years it has become an absolute nightmare to try to get to some concrete decisions and finally know where you stand. It is even more so in tax and company law. These movements are in the right direction and are full of good intent but, like all matters of good intent, they are paved with a lot of uncertainty.

          One of the problems with small business is management. The failure of small business in the main, while it is always blamed on something else, in very large measure is a question of management. The best tool of management is proper accounts, and proper accounts will be kept only if there is a compulsory requirement to report on them.

          The proposal here brings forward the concept of one director. That is a very fine concept. But a lot of people in business would ask, `Why do you need this?' In terms of accountability and responsibility, in recent times there has been a lot of talk about wayward creditors. We have heard about the big ones in the newspapers, but there are thousands of small ones who walk away from bankruptcy petitions under circumstances of loose accounts, no accounts at all or with pure cash situations.

          Therefore I would like the committee to take into consideration the creditors' and debtors' positions—it is not only the income tax commissioner's particular problem—as they relate to ordinary commerce and the desirability of going to one director rather than having two. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) referred to some matters earlier. I think she would have drawn attention to the case of a proprietary company involved in a family law action where, if it is run by one company director and a residual partner, there would be no access to those accounts so they would not necessarily know what was going on. Therefore in a normal family business it would be prudent, I would have thought, to look to those matters.

          Finally, on the question of audit, when the committee refers this to the expert committee involved I hope that genuine consideration will be given to finding a way to ensure that proper accounts are kept, even on the say-so of the auditor who could state that he has lodged a taxation return based on the corporate accounts. This may be beneficial towards keeping some form of management tool alive and well in small business.

         This amendment bill is aimed to clarify the scope of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992, and is part of a positive program by the government. We have a very proud record on legislation in this area; in fact, the World Health Organisation sees us as a world leader on this matter. An article by Adrian Bradley in the

        Why is this important? It is important because the World Health Organisation estimates that three million people die each year from smoking related illnesses and it expects this to increase to 10 million a year by the year 2020. In Australia about 3.5 million Australians smoke, representing 28 per cent of people over the age of 18 years. This is falling, with 32 per cent of men and 24.7 per cent of women smoking.

         Part of that change has been the move away from the availability of advertising. I suspect that, like me, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott will remember the Peter Stuyvesant advertisements—London, Paris, New York—at the Saturday afternoon flicks, which is where we used to go in the world before television. Mr Deputy Speaker may not remember that; he may be too young. But, in those days, overseas travel and all the sophistication that involved was a great model for those of us who aspired to that. Part and parcel of that was cigarette smoking. We have seen a major change due to government policy and a rearguard action from some of the national cigarette companies, culminating in a High Court challenge to some of our legislation.

There are rules that all employees of the parliament must adhere to, and it concerns me greatly that certain members in this place feel that it is quite appropriate for them to inflict passive smoking on the rest of us.

         It is very important that all adults act as effective role models. As we curtail opportunities to promote cigarette messages, one of the important issues we have to address is young people taking up smoking. In her article by the Drug Education Journal of Australia entitled `Peter Jackson, you're lying: education or advertising—which message is more convincing?' Margaret Powell outlines the importance of the communicated message. She states:

        In our consumer-oriented society, there is another force operating in children's lives. Independence and adulthood are seen to be manifested through appealing images which are used skilfully by advertising agencies to sell products, to sell cigarettes. Despite the wide public acceptance of detrimental effects of smoking among children and their peers, smoking cigarettes is seen to respect independence, maturity, vitality, popularity and success.
       </para>
       <para>
        We find that young people, particularly those in puberty and perhaps even from grade 7, see smoking as an important rite of passage. This is something we have to address not only by removing those public images but also by sending very positive anti-smoking messages and providing children with assertiveness training. It is absolutely essential that cigarette manufacturers not be allowed to sponsor sport or cultural activities. I believe that, as we have continued to curtail this activity, other companies have taken up the slack and are now sponsoring major sporting events. I believe that, when cigarette manufacturers are banned from sponsoring sporting events, the current consumer acquiescence to sponsorship of sport will also change.

         The other issue we have to address is the way cigarette companies are using value adding programs to entice young people to smoke. It is certainly something we will have to address because, often, the people targeted are those who are most likely to be affected by smoking. For instance, in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian
         </emphasis>
         of 3 February 1995, a reference is made to a Senate submission in relation to a Northern Territory individual. The article mentions a promotion being offered to stores in Top End Aboriginal communities. The promotion involves a free T-shirt with the community name on the back and a `big country' and `Malboro' advertising slogan on the front. All these initiatives are encouraging young people to smoke and are trying to get around our advertising bans. I look forward to continuing my comments after question time.

Given that since then the current account deficit has risen to the highest monthly and three-monthly levels ever recorded, and given that six of the last seven monthly results have been above $2 billion, do you seriously still suggest that we are seeing a limitation in the rise, to use your own words?

The underlying point is that the current account deficit is up in part because of the very strong rise in the capital goods components.

        In other words, this government removed exchange controls, unlike the former Treasurer with people in the Reserve Bank ticking little bits of paper about whether an Australian company could invest abroad. When Boral decided to become the largest brick and tile manufacturer in the United States, when the likes of CSR, Pacific Dunlop—or name them—the breweries, or the transport companies like TNT and Mayne Nickless decided similarly, they did so because they believe in the long run it is in the interests of their business to get behind these tariff barriers and get into these markets when they come to their market share in Australia.

I believe that if it came to the key question of whether the government would say to Australian business, `You shall not invest abroad because we don't want any covering of that investment on the current account,' the answer to that is that the government has made the right decision and removed exchange controls and let that happen. Compare that, Mr Speaker, with the cloistered, closeted, frightened little economy that John Howard left them; all locked up with their market share up to optimums. They could not sell any more beer in Australia. They could not go offshore and sell beer in Europe or Japan because he would not let them. Now they have gone off and done it and he says, `Isn't it pretty. You have got all this net debt.'

         —In response to the honourable member for Paterson, I can say that I am aware of some statements made yesterday by the Shadow Treasurer. When speaking on ABC radio about the housing sector he said, `And basically it has been closed down in terms of activity.' What he was talking about was the release of the January approvals figures which showed a decline of some 9.7 per cent seasonally adjusted in that month. What we see with those figures is that there is quite a bit of fluctuation month by month, even though they are seasonally adjusted, and that particularly comes about because of the fact that we have included in them not just houses but also medium density dwelling units in Sydney and Melbourne in particular, but also in most capital cities.

         —Approvals for those housing units have been strongly increasing. Of course, they happen in a lumpy way. When they come in, they push the units up for that month. When they are not there, there is a big drop. If we look at South Australia, in the month of January there was a 35 per cent increase in private dwelling approvals because of the approval of one large medium-density project in the city of Adelaide. So I think that shows you about the monthly variability, Mr Speaker.

         But it is also important to note that if we look at the figures for private sector housing—not medium-density units but ordinary housing—approvals for ordinary housing fell by half a per cent. Of course, that is a much different picture. In fact, looking at that picture, Mr Silberberg, of the Housing Industry Association—who is not known normally for his support of the government in any way—said:

         Mr Speaker, that is obviously an absurd overstatement, to put it at the least. In fact, one has to have some regard, in looking at the downturn in housing which has certainly occurred in recent times, to the levels at which it has been. Of course, it has been at record levels. The housing industry has been doing better, until recent times, than it has ever done in the history of the country.

         In this upturn we have built 480,000 additional dwelling units. That is more than in any other upturn in Australia's history. So, since the economy got on the upswing again, from 1991 to 1994, 480,000 dwelling units have been built, more than any previous recovery. It is housing that essentially led the economy back onto a growth path.

         You cannot, of course, expect the industry to keep on belting away with substantial increases in activity year by year, particularly when it has generally been seen as running ahead of the underlying level of demand given by the rate of formation of family units in this country. Therefore, at some stage, it had to slow, and that is what we have been witnessing in recent times, albeit assisted by some increases in interest rates.

         Nevertheless, let us get it clearly understood that 1994 was an enormously good year for housing. Total approvals were 189,000 units, the highest level on record—absolutely the highest level on record. The Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry is saying that for this financial year, 1994-95, it will be 160,000. So there is some downturn—we are seeing that in the figures for approvals and commencements—but that is a downturn from exceedingly high levels of activity.

         In fact, the level of approvals in January, at 13,200, is still above the average for the last 10 years. So we are still at above average levels of activity, going back for a decade, in approvals, and with commencements we see a similar sort of picture.

         Mr Speaker, it is just the most ridiculous statement—typical of the opposition's attitude of massive doomsaying about the Australian economy to the point where there is just no credibility in anything that it says—for the shadow Treasurer to say that the industry had been basically closed down. All that is happening is that it is tailoring off from the highest levels of activity that have occurred in the history of this country to levels which are still well above average compared with those of the last decade or so.

He said, `Our jobsback policy remains intact.' Let us get this on the record. `Our jobsback policy,' he said `remains intact.' So nothing has changed except the camouflage.

         In the year ending February 1994, for example, 1.6 million people changed jobs or employers—that is in a labour market of eight million. That is 20 per cent of the labour force in one year—130,000 new positions a month or 4,000 a day. In other words, that constant change in the labour market would mean that those people who line up to protect their minimums or to maintain, for instance, their annual leave loading or their overtime, would find that they were unable to secure it.

        In other words, there is a sudden death. If you lose your job and you take a new one, you lose the option of being able to secure these under-minimums, you are back to individual wage contract, master and servant provisions of the common law, and then you are left in the position that formally the overtime or the annual leave loading you are paid goes.

         We often hear the Leader of the Opposition talking about families. Doesn't he think that these 1.7 million people who change their jobs at the risk of losing these sorts of sums—$100 to $120 per week—in overtime and annual leave loadings are members of Australian families? Doesn't he think those reductions in their incomes are real? Doesn't he believe that, as he said, the labour market reform is exactly as he described it under Jobsback, as agreed by the member for Flinders, and that the notion of incrementalism or gradualism or evolution is really just a camouflage for the old policy the opposition has always had of making sure it whacks the 1.6 or 1.7 million people who jump out of their existing job and cannot protect themselves? That is his policy. Let me say what ours is: it is a set of genuine safety net provisions, a set of genuine minimums—

Let us note the point that when the Leader of the Opposition said in response to Dr Hewson's departure the other day that the labour market, as he put it, was still the area of great reform, what he and the member for Flinders mean is whacking people on low incomes and knocking $100 to $120 per week off them. That is what it means. At least we can cut through all the hocus-pocus, the fuzz, all the warm inner glow and all the fluffiness.

         Again, there is a stark difference. This group opposite never learn anything. As if the profit share in the economy is not high enough, as if the proportion of national income going to profits is not high enough, without trying to increase it at the expense of the low and middle income earners of this country. That is what the member for Bennelong is now committed to, as always. I wanted to use this opportunity to expose exactly what he seeks to do.

I never did, and the Governor corroborated the proper operation of monetary policy between the government and him, but he admonished you for your remarks.

         —One of the cornerstones of the Industrial Relations Reform Act is the maintenance and the strengthening of the award safety net. The act requires the commission to ensure that the award system provides a secure, relevant and consistent minimum set of wages and conditions. Of course, it is backed up by accord mark 7, which has provided safety net adjustments for low paid workers in each of the last three years—the last being the current $8 adjustment.

         In contrast with this, the coalition's industrial relations policy contains no safety net—none whatsoever—other than four miserly conditions that are set out in Jobsback. Earlier today in question time, the Prime Minister illustrated what would happen to people looking for a job under the Liberal's Jobsback.

         It is worth asking the question: what will happen to the 45 per cent of workers who remain in their jobs for five years or more? For those people who choose to remain on their award, assuming that they are allowed to, of course, under Jobsback, the future is bleak indeed. That is because Jobsback has absolutely no mechanism to update the award. Awards will, under Jobsback, be frozen in time. The member for Bennelong said on Melbourne radio on 12 February 1993 in response to a caller who asked him, if she stayed on her award, would she be stuck on the same wage indefinitely:

        That is what he said. It is worth looking at one of the many examples of what could happen to a worker under Jobsback. Take the case of a textile worker in a factory and on an award rate of $349.40 per week. That textile worker, under a coalition government, if you assume that inflation was running at 3 per cent—I believe that is pretty generous to the opposition, because the last time the member for Bennelong held the fiscal reins inflation was running at 11.4 per cent—would see his or her award eroded over a three-year period, in real terms, by $31.40—a decrease of 8.3 per cent for that worker.

         Pity the family of that textile worker. So much for the opposition's commitment to families. Think about the family of that textile worker. Make no mistake, Jobsback is still the policy of the coalition. As recently as 18 April 1994, the member for Bennelong said on radio station 2GB:

         As the Minister for Industrial Relations has made clear, 55 per cent of all employees covered by federal awards are now signed up under enterprise agreements. In New South Wales, that figure is 13 or 14 per cent. In other words, the industrial relations policy of the Fahey government has been a failure, as has all of its other policies.

         Mr Carr repeated my point that nothing happens in New South Wales. When asked by Mr Oakes, Mr Fahey said, `Look at the railway out to Mascot, the one we are going to build out there, and the toll road.' These are all things that he promises on the state government's budget. But how many industrial projects of substance are going on in New South Wales? The answer is that there is nothing to speak of. New South Wales is a state which is stone dead. It is absolutely dead in the water. The businesses are going to Queensland because nothing happens in New South Wales.

        Does he approve the technique used by the ALP when it used Labor booth workers without identification who were instructed to target voters and to deceive them into believing that they were supporting independents by distributing a how-to-vote card where the words, `voting independent' clearly swamped the ALP logo in this fine print? Why were Labor's dummy independents instructed to continue to issue these bogus how-to-vote cards even if challenged by booth officials? Will the Prime Minister assure the House that during the ACT by-election for the seat of Canberra, the ALP will not repeat this deliberate deception of voters?

Meanwhile, in his office sit three people, and in the federal secretariat, who are into this appalling push-polling. This push-polling was an appalling process.

         So the difference between me and him is that up front, straightaway, I say, `I don't condone it. I wouldn't have a bar of any of these techniques.' This compares with the snide, putrid, underhand polling technique of push-polling where somebody is actually criminally defamed, which is the game you have been in, and then you walk around saying, `I am little honest John.' We know how honest you are, don't we? We all know, don't we—like you were honest in the 1970s, wandering through while the tax commissioner wrote you all those letters—the telephone book—`Please, Treasurer, help us beat the criminal avoidance of tax industry'. There were pleas from a public servant to an uncaring, unlistening, smug, slick Treasurer. We know how honest you were then. We know that's how you got the ironic title of honest John. That honesty is no less apparent in terms of its irony than is the Leader of the Opposition's preparedness not to dissociate himself from push-polling, sweepstake things in Western Australia or dummy companies in South Australia. They are the things. The difference is that the people who manage these are on his staff—this day—and running his federal secretariat.

In 1992 he carried out a review of the Australian air traffic services system. That review included a number of criticisms of the way the Civil Aviation Authority was then operating Sydney airport.

         today, Dr Ratner endorsed the way the CAA is operating Sydney airport and warned against the reopening of the east-west runway. He did so on the grounds that reopening the runway would cut safety margins by reintroducing simultaneous operations on crossing runways—that is, the SIMOPS system—for a doubtful gain in capacity. He was quite adamant in his support of the current operations. In today's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        That is what Dr Ratner had to say. Of course, those views totally go against those of that other self-appointed air space management expert, the Leader of the Opposition, whose announced policy is to reopen the east-west runway. To be fair, Dr Ratner acknowledges that SIMOPS is employed at a number of airports around the world and that it was employed at Kingsford Smith airport until recently. In today's
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian

        Dr Ratner yesterday referred to an incident in 1991, when SIMOPS almost led to a disaster at Sydney airport. That incident involved a Thai Airways DC10, carrying 167 passengers; an Ansett A320, carrying 101 passengers; and a Qantas B747, which had 353 passengers on board. All up, that is 621 people. As the BASI investigation—which was the official investigation of that incident—reports, those 621 people were 11 metres from disaster. You can see the depiction of the cross-runway configuration on the BASI official report, which was available from 12 August 1991.

         Yet now opposition members are happy to reject the overwhelming expert advice, and they propose the reintroduction of a mode of airport operations in our largest airport—the airport that services our largest city—which is less safe than the present mode of operations. They do it all for no gain in capacity. The obvious question to put to honest John is this: why are they advocating this? What is behind it? It certainly cannot be for noise.

It certainly cannot be for noise because the official figures show that, in total, 58,000 people fewer are seriously or moderately affected by aircraft noise as a result of the parallel runway configuration. It certainly cannot be for safety reasons. As Dr Ratner points out, it certainly cannot be for capacity reasons. I think it is fair to record that opposition members have shamelessly tried to claim that the current operations—operations that were decided in 1989 and confirmed in 1991—have been introduced to benefit my electorate. That has been their claim.

         Yet in 1995 we have the Leader of the Opposition proposing a policy that goes against all the expert advice but which will benefit his electorate. If he were so honest, he should come out and admit his cynicism or come clean with whatever expert advice he has to support his policy. The world's aviation community will be very interested to read it.

On 4 June 1992, in answer to a question from me concerning dead-end jobs, you said you were no longer content to consign our children to low paid, uninteresting jobs. In this context can you explain what is interesting, highly paid, challenging and value added about trucking the unemployed out to Melbourne airport to meet and greet overseas visitors, as is proposed by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training? Does the Prime Minister believe that hotel touts, map sellers and bus stop bag carriers who eke out a living in airports in Third World countries are anything other than a sign that their governments have failed to solve unemployment? Finally, on what date does your department predict that the unemployed in the north-west and west of Melbourne will be fully trained and, therefore, that lack of skill will no longer be an explanation for unemployment?

         The commitment to young Australians by this government is very clear for everybody to see. I am happy to say that the proof of the pudding is in the eating, with employment amongst young people picking up its share of the growth in jobs, which has been just on 500,000 since the election. This government, as no other government before it, has done things to lift participation rates in schools. When the last coalition government left office, only three kids in 10 completed secondary school. It is now up to eight in 10—a revolution in participation.

         There has also been a mighty change in the participation of young women in schools and their passage through secondary school and into tertiary institutions. In fact, there were more entrants into tertiary institutions this year amongst young women than amongst young men. As a consequence of that tertiary growth, where we have added the equivalent of about 16 universities of the size of Sydney and Melbourne universities to the system since 1985-86, and now the commitment of $1.1 billion to the National Training Authority, it is manifestly obvious where the government's heart lies—with young Australians.

         We are trying to train young Australians for new jobs, and I would say that we are training them successfully. We are not just training them; we are committed to them. We will not let them drop out under the age of 18 without case managing them back into school or into training and work. Tell me of any other Commonwealth government that ever made that commitment.

        I was asked a question by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), who has been embarrassed by the fact that he has not sought to make clear his position and, as such, has condoned the grievous and putrid tactics of push polling of the Liberal Party. He sought to introduce into the House a question about which he knew the imputations to be false. At the time, I was unaware of the matters and I made that very clear.

         As I made that clear, honest John guffawed and laughed. He gave his instructions to the frontbench and they all laughed and went on when I said, `I did not know about it.' I did not know about it. I said, if it was as he described it in New South Wales, I would not condone it.

In his office is Mr Morris, who we find today in the advisers box, who has been talking about the executive who was in charge of the South Australian Liberals big donor scheme, which is called `Catch Tim Ltd', which we found donated $100,000 to the Liberal Party.

When I said I was not aware of it, I was not aware of it because it did not happen; it did not exist. The technique that he ascribes to the Labor Party did not exist. The how-to-vote card, which is around here, says `Vote 1 Independent' and then a question mark and `Don't get the Liberal alliance chaos in government by mistake. Give your preferences to the Australian Labor Party'. It does not look like a subterfuge to me. It does not look like an independent's how-to-vote to me. It does not look as if the people holding that out are representing themselves as independents when it has the ALP logo on it and it is authorised by the Australian Labor Party.

Instead of taking it on the chin and saying that is how slick Parliament House is these days, he said, `Hang on, I do not think it is slick. I ought to say, "Hang on, you've offered me this. I'll say it came from you."' But they said, `Oh, you cannot say it came from us.'

         The Prime Minister did not bother, when he was making his speech, to refer to the ALP instructions. He said, `The person handing out the preference how-to-vote should attempt to get the last position in the queue.' That is fair enough. He continued, `. . . not forgetting that there is a minimum distance of six metres.' Here is a sheet that says, `Booth captains preference how-to-vote green slips.' Listen to this, Mr Speaker. It says, `For those booths which have preference how-to-vote cards, please don't have ALP identifiable badges.'

In other words the instructions are saying, `We want to disguise the fact that we are trying to dupe the voters.' That was the gravamen of my question. It was true and correct in every particular. I accept that, notwithstanding, those opposite will use their weight of numbers but I take the opportunity, as the Prime Minister did, to say a number of general things about electoral matters.

         If ever there was a lucky politician in Australia it has to be the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), because the population in general would now believe that the nickname honest John came from a reputation for public integrity during the time he was a minister. In fact, the nickname honest John was coined at one decisive point: it was coined in 1978 after the 1978 budget in which the Hobart
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Mercury
         </emphasis>
         —the most extreme in terms of its presentation, and with the rest of the Australian provincial dailies all with the same theme—carried on the front page the words `lies, lies, lies' in huge bold type. They carried those words `lies, lies, lies' because John Howard had brought down a budget and in that budget was a direct repudiation of all the election promises he had put forward in 1977. So, from that day on until quite recently, honest was accompanied by quotation marks. That is where the title came from. This is a useful opportunity for us to provide the House with a reminder of that point.

They went straight out the door, except the poor chap at the table, the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who has to sit here and carry the can for his leader because somebody has to sit on the opposition front bench. The member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), who has covered himself in glory in recent days by his efforts inside the Liberal Party to deal with the issue of push polling, is also sitting here and half of the Independents are sitting here.

         This censure motion today is to complain that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) misled the House with his allegations about how-to-vote arrangements in the ACT. These were not allegations; these were facts. The basis of the facts is none other than the documentation, which was circulated to ALP branch workers at the ACT elections and which I hold in my hand. The evidence contained in these documents shows beyond all reasonable doubt that the claims made by the opposition are absolutely correct. The important thing is that neither the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) nor the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) makes any serious attempt to explain the unexplainable. Why is it so? It is because in the ACT election we merely saw a continuation of a long line of cheating, cajolery and activities of this dubious nature that you and your party in virtually every state of Australia—whether it be Queensland, New South Wales or Victoria—have perpetrated for far too long.

This particular candidate claimed to give his second preferences to the National Party. But was the Labor Party to be outdone on this? Was there any risk to be taken? Of course not. The Labor Party put out its own how-to-vote card, which said, `Make your voice heard in the government by voting for the Confederate Action Party,' but then it said—we are told this is the Labor Party technique—`Don't support Borbidge's bickering coalition. Give your second preference to your Wayne Goss Labor candidate Graeme Hall and do not waste your vote.'

         —Even you and I can agree on something. The second instruction gives the line to use when handing out the how-to-votes, and this is part of the real substance of the deception. It says that the line used should be something like `Voting Independent?' Do not forget, we are dealing with people who have no badges on, no distinguishing ALP characteristics at all. Why? Because they were told by the Labor Party to take them off. If that is not deception, would you please tell us what is.

         People going to the polling booth took this piece of paper, believing that they had the opportunity to exercise their democratic right and vote Independent because it had the word `Independent' along the top of it. Voters in the ACT did not know the truth; they had no reason to doubt this. They are learning what millions of Australians have learnt in recent days, and it is quite simple: you cannot trust Labor with anything. You really cannot. When you look back on its record, you find that it never learns and it never changes. I have demonstrated in this debate that—

         When the Leader of the House made his great contribution, he complained that my colleagues were not here to listen to him. They had much more sensible things to do. He made one most interesting comment. He talked about presenting an honest statement! The evidence is so blatant. You forgot that the word `honesty' has a little `dis' in front of it. It is called dishonesty, and there is a heck of a difference between the two words. A growing number of people in this country have had enough; they want a bit of honesty in government. They want to see the situation improved. They will not see that from a Labor Party which, time after time, has demonstrated so clearly its utter inability to properly improve the situation. I turn now to branch stacking. Back in 1970 a certain gentleman who is now the Deputy Premier of Queensland—

Who is the member for Blaxland? What is his name? Paul Keating. Precisely. The report states:

         The Leader of the Opposition has also said to me that he wants to make a personal explanation. That is for members to show where they personally have been misrepresented; it is not for debating or arguments about other extraneous matter. On that basis, because I have two other personal explanations—that is where we are up to in the afternoon's proceedings—I am prepared to give the Leader of the Opposition the opportunity to make a personal explanation to show where he has been personally misrepresented.

       That is the matter on which I claim to have been misrepresented. It misrepresents the truth in many respects. The facts are: firstly, Fred Many was convicted in 1986 of a brutal rape which left his victim near to death. He got 20 years gaol under the sexual assault legislation for which I was responsible. I was the Attorney-General that passed that legislation. He subsequently appealed that sentence, and the Court of Criminal Appeal in New South Wales reduced the sentence to 12 years 10 months taking into consideration his activities as a police informant in the Domican case.

          , which was a report on violence in Australian schools. It is interesting when debating in this chamber that, unlike the major chamber of the House of Representatives, the enemy faces each other eyeball to eyeball across the chamber. This report of the committee, which is an all-party committee of this House, was a unanimous report.

          I learned a number of major things in participating in this inquiry. The first thing that I learned which was most significant is that teachers believe that those who commit physical violence generally lack self-esteem. The second thing that I learned which I believe is of significance is that over the past two decades, as a permissive society has developed, we have increasingly given children their rights, but, in the absence of parental discipline and the structures of dos and don'ts, children have been left to flounder, without direction and experience in how to take responsibility for their own actions and deal responsibly with their peers and with the broader community. That is a substantive problem.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The third major thing that I learned during the inquiry was that there are models of school practice which generally exhibit strong leadership and a whole school approach, creating a culture of caring that negates both violence and bullying. In that respect, I discussed the experiences of Mayfield Primary School in Launceston. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) has largely accepted the findings of our report.

          I would now like to deal with some of the more major recommendations. The minister has said in his report that he believes that a series of forums on violence in schools held in each state and territory would be a very useful process for compiling the good practice that is occurring in schools around Australia.

          I have no major philosophical disagreement with the minister about holding forums, but it seems to me, in a practical sense, that we would be doing an awful lot of spinning wheels, bringing together a lot of people for lots of discussions, which would simply parallel other meetings and other discussions. The committee mentality and structure carries on.

          I would have much preferred that the minister had accepted our recommendations in principle and then an expert go out and do some fact finding. Let us fund an expert to do some fact finding and report on the primary schools of Australia: to report on good practice, particularly where their practice has acted to almost totally eliminate the concept of bullying; to report on practices which have been successful in integrating strong approaches at dealing with problems of illiteracy, particularly in the early years of primary school; and to disseminate that information widely to primary and secondary schools throughout Australia.

          The minister dealt firstly with our recommendation that the ministers of the Commonwealth, states and territories fund the evaluation of successful approaches adopted by schools. It was his response to hold a series of forums, which I have dealt with. However, he did go on in his recommendation and canvass the possibility that the Commonwealth would investigate establishing, in cooperation with the state and territory governments, a best practice award for schools that display leadership in this field. I commend the minister for that response; I think that will be really useful.

          One of the things that we have learned through this committee, in travelling around the country, is that the apprenticeship awards—the awards that deal with excellence in the international skills olympics—have been a tremendous boost to TAFE colleges and to the apprenticeship systems around the country. Many of those young people who have participated in the international skills olympics have gone on to find rewarding, responsible and satisfying jobs very early in their careers. No doubt their participation in those skills olympics has enhanced their career prospects. They provide an example for their peers who are studying in the skills field. I compliment the minister on his suggestion for a best practice award and would suggest that that is appropriate.

          We recommended that the minister, in consultation with the states, finance the development of a national school violence data collection system. The minister has in total agreed with us. I thank the minister. The minister said that the Commonwealth will refer this recommendation to the School Statistics Taskforce of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs and that he would ask the task force to examine how more extensive national data on the issue can be obtained and how the data could be used for the development of performance indicators on school violence. That is a very good initiative.

          There is no way the Commonwealth could now impose its will or the committee's will on the states, and nor should it. This is a complex area and involves issues such as: the definition of violence—and levels of violence; the issue of bullying and where it fits in those definitions; and how we report on those issues. It does need to be decided by consensus. All the states need to agree finally on a formula of definition so that the data collection can recommence throughout the country in an identical manner, so at the end of the day we have some numbers that are of use to us.

          This committee was told anecdotally that physical violence was on the wane and that there was less physical violence in schools in Australia today than 30 or 40 years ago. That is a very positive outcome, but we are not sure if that is true. The problem is there is no data to back up the observations. We really need a comprehensive but simple data collection system that will give us some numbers and allow people to take actions based on the findings. For example, if some mechanisms in some states are working and producing outcomes which are better than the models in other states, certainly it would behove the states who are having poor results to take cognisance of the fact that they have colleagues in other places who seem to be doing it better, and perhaps they should shift their practices. This data collection issue is really quite important.

          Another of our recommendations was that the minister discuss with the state and territory ministers the need for early intervention strategies to address violent and anti-social behaviour in students. In part, the minister's response said that the Commonwealth government endorses the committee's finding that preventative action in the early years of schooling is far more likely to prove effective than any piecemeal or remedial solutions focused on students in older age groups. I thank the minister for that. We are convinced that is right.

          If we get it right early, the chances are that behaviour will be vastly improved in the later years of schooling as well. However, we did receive some evidence that some young people who demonstrate no tendencies to violence or bullying in primary school seem to go a bit haywire under some peer pressure or community or social mores when they reach their teens, and there have to be different mechanisms to deal with that.

          The minister talked about the gender and violence project, developing a video on violence for use in primary schools, but this issue is not just a gender issue. It is not just that little boys beat up on little girls or big boys beat up on big girls; in fact there was some anecdotal evidence that young girls are increasingly resorting to verbal bullying themselves, and that is quite worrying for many of our educators. I am not sure that this is totally a gender issue. Certainly, the physical violence occurs largely between young males—or young males physically violating young girls—but the bullying aspect seems to be more evenly balanced and the fact that there seems to be some increasing physical violence amongst young girls was worrying to the committee.

          One of our recommendations was an examination of the effects of television, video, film and video games on the learning outcomes and behaviour of Australian children. The minister agrees with our concern that media and entertainment may have an effect on violence and behaviour of children, not only in the school setting but in the broader community. The minister says that the communications and the arts portfolio already makes a significant contribution to safeguarding the wellbeing of children in relation to media content. I think I would have to question the minister's statement. I am not totally convinced that our classification mechanisms do work.

          When I turn on my television, which is rare I must admit, there certainly are days when no matter what channel I switch to there is nothing but violence on show. I am not convinced that that is for the betterment of our young people. I note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has recently called for the examination of the possibility of a fourth free to air television channel, largely dedicated to families and children. I suppose that is worth exploring, although I am not sure that there is enough market and I think that market research would have to be done. I can tell you that many families would support a reduction in the amount of violence that we see on free to air television in Australia. Perhaps pay TV will help solve part of this problem. One can only hope, but we will never know until we get there and unfortunately we are a bit slow in that regard.

          But, in discussing our recommendation on the International Year of the Family, the minister went on to compliment the government for supporting the parents' role in school education by providing $555,000 to the parents association over three years, and that is in rather dramatic conflict with the donation of the Minister for Health (Dr Lawrence) of a quarter of million dollars in one shot to the December issue of

          This is an issue of very considerable concern to parents. In my previous professional experience I had some involvement in counselling victims of violence in schools, and also as a parent, as I charted my own daughter's journey through primary and secondary education, I have been a concerned consumer in this area. It is very pleasing to note the general support of the government for the committee's report and a number of initiatives that the government is taking on board in response to this report. The response has actually been presented very quickly, in my view.

          I want to make some comments about the general area. I certainly think there is a need for further research but also, as the government indicates, it is prepared to participate in the collection of data and the dissemination of that data to schools, particularly on the incidence as well as benchmarks and best practice options that the committee was able to pick up during the course of its inquiry.

          One area that I have some concern about is the evidence on the causal relationship between violence and self-esteem of the perpetrators and the victims. I believe there does need to be much more research into what determines why some children choose to bully. However, I acknowledge that it is not simply an individual psychological problem but that we have to look at a number of factors that cause violence in schools. I note the committee's comments on page 11, paragraph 2.3:

         I believe that not only a whole of school approach is required to combat violence but a whole of community approach, and it does mean getting parents involved and out of school factors as well as media, and in particular the social structure of the school system.

          One of the initiatives that I as a parent was involved with in the primary school that my children attended was the development of a human relationships education program. This whole issue had a very long gestation and parents fought for it in the dark days of conservative rule in Queensland. When the green light was given for the development of human relationships education, a great deal was done by the Queensland education department to foster community involvement.

          There were a number of participants in my small mining community. What was interesting, I have to say, was that a minority group which represented—if one would describe it as such—a `fundamentalist Christian' position had a very narrow view of what should constitute a human relationships education. I would have to summarise it as a `God, queen, country and the

          One of the issues that I believe is very important is the recognition of the power structures within a school. That very much involves having the adults in the school system be aware of the sort of power that they have, and of when the system can get into the abuse of power. It has been my experience, in observing children, that they have a very strong sense of social justice and are very aware when teachers override what could be seen as fair play or a fair and reasonable outcome. It is very important that teachers be aware of that when they use their power as adults: their power to be more articulate and more analytical, and to put students down. So, when we look at the structures that need to be in place to provide a really caring school, based on mutual respect, all relationships need to be taken into consideration.

          One of the very important findings of the committee is in relation to the importance of early intervention. I quote from page 8 of the introduction. It says:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The majority of evidence suggests that inappropriate behaviours are identifiably in children as early as pre-school and kindergarten. Changing a child's behaviour patterns after the age of eight requires significantly more resourcing, with reduced changes of success, than if the problem was addressed in the earliest schooling years.
        </para>
        <para>
         Indeed, I can remember observing a number of children who went right through kindergarten, preschool and grades one and two with my daughters. It was very clear that they had already embarked upon a career that would ultimately isolate them and nominate them as troublemakers and difficult children. I then saw the responses that were used—being, at that time, very traditional school discipline responses—having absolutely no success at all.

          At that stage, I was not practising professionally, but I was bringing my professional eye to my observations. Living in a small community, I could also see the complementary family problems that were contributing to the way these children would present at school. I was feeling very concerned to know that this would be the ultimate outcome for these children. So I fully endorse the recommendation of the committee about the need for early intervention strategies, and I endorse the response from the government in this area.

          The other very important area that I think we should spend a couple of minutes on is the types of violence. If one looks at the media representations, one tends to see the more overt type of bullying. But, as the previous speaker said, actual, overt physical violence—the `putting kids' heads down the toilets' type of harassment, which still happens—is less rare than other forms of bullying.

          However, the other forms of bullying are particularly destructive to the developing self-esteem of young people. I quote from page 7. It says:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee was told that one of the biggest unrecognised aspects of violence in schools was gender harassment. As a component of violence, it was widespread in schools and was largely unrecognised as a violent act. One survey found that, as part of their day to day routine, girls in co-educational classrooms and school yards suffered sex-based harassment from boys and sometimes teachers. The Committee was also advised that physical violence amongst girls was more likely to occur than it was in the past.
        </para>
        <para>
         That was mentioned by the previous speaker. It goes on to say:

         of 1 March—just yesterday, in fact—which gives an account of a high school assembly on 1 August last year where it was suggested that an absent student was gay. When this student attempted to have redress for this accusation, and the resulting hostility and isolation, he got no support at all. I gather this case is now subject to some further investigation.

        <para first-indent="16">

          This is one of the newer types of harassment—attempting to pigeonhole all the students in terms of their gender orientation. But it is absolutely inappropriate, whether it be in grade two or in grade eight or nine, where I believe it reaches its zenith. It is a way of isolating and imposing a power differential. Often that involves a peer group—there is an in-group and an out-group, whether it is the cool group and the not-so-cool group or some other group. But to raise suggestions that someone is not in the mainstream of heterosexual orientation is very distressing to many students who, of course, have not really developed a clear sexual orientation. It is very important that those kinds of issues are addressed and students learn to understand the type of process in which they are all unconsciously involved. I have certainly seen this operating in schools in my electorate.

          Racism and talking about different ethnic backgrounds is very important. The other issue that is part of this is where students are different and I suspect this is what the previous speaker was mentioning. Gender harassment is not all about violence from one sex to the other, although the evidence indicates that it is males who primarily are the perpetrators. However, it is about students who are different, and one of the things that all schools must address is the importance of allowing people to be themselves. Not everybody is going to be the best cricketer, the best netball player, the most beautiful, most Elle look-alike girl in the school, or the person who looks like whoever the male role models are at the moment—probably Shane Warne or someone.

But the important thing is that, across the spectrum, children are as individual as, dare I say, my colleagues in this parliament—and most of us would not make it onto the big screen. I believe it is a very important part of the whole school approach to allow boys to be more feminine and more interested in quieter pursuits, to allow girls to be more assertive and interested in sport and computers, to allow variation and to help students and teachers value that individual difference in people. Teaching students assertive techniques and to be constructively assertive, rather than aggressive, is very important. But clarifying communication is also very important.

          To return to the gender violence issue, the other part of that that we have to address is the structural inequality in many schools. As the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training said on page 14 of its report on violence in Australian schools:

          I believe it is an excellent report and I certainly applaud the government's response.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Programs like the national domestic violence education program, the national prevention strategy for child abuse and neglect, which is very important, and the task force on gender equity are all being supported by the Commonwealth.

          A recent MBF survey conducted in New South Wales found that a vast majority of primary school children starting high school feared initiation ceremonies and bullying by older students. This fear is real; this fear is genuine. Ms Victoria King, an education consultant from Victoria, states quite correctly that students had limited—what she called—coping skills to deal with being put down or to deal with conflict and bullying. It is these limited coping abilities which result in violence in schools having such a detrimental effect on the victims.

I am pleased to say that many states and territories have already recognised the seriousness of this problem and are putting in place strategies to combat it.

Jane fell between 4-8 stairs before stopping. Lucy stopped for a few seconds, saw a graze on Jane's right wrist then sniggered and continued on down the stairs and out to the other girls. As Jane fell she twisted around catching and ripping a hole in her top from a piece of wire sticking out from the banister. She hit her head, right shoulder, right elbow, left knee and landed on the back of her right hand, not the palm . . . We went to the hospital for a bone scan. There is `uptake' to the right hand and wrist and we were informed that she needed extensive physiotherapy and must see an Orthopaedic Surgeon for follow up treatment and another bone scan. While waiting at the bus stop to go to the hospital Jane was harassed by other students at the college who called her a `snob' sarcastically mocking her injury and how it occurred. We took Jane to the College to take back the homework she had managed to do, when one of the girls at the College advised Jane not to walk down any dark alleys as, in her words, she might get `egged'. We are a low income family and we cannot meet the expenses for the physiotherapist or Orthopaedic Surgeon.

Again, the government failed to mention the derailed child-care system which in September 1993 saw 214,000 women claiming that the absence of child-care options was the main reason they were not actively looking for work, with 26 per cent of women identifying lack of child-care options as their major career barrier.

Guess what one of the programs is which Star suggests will address violence in high schools? You guessed it, Mr Deputy Speaker: it is basic literacy.

I stress that the committee did not state that these factors cause school violence, but merely stated that they encourage violence in schools.

Every other state government in this country that is largely responsible for children of this age group has denied funding and reduced funding. In fact, Mr Kennett in Victoria has reduced funding for education by some half a billion dollars. The member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) will know that his Premier has reduced funding to education in South Australia by $40 million, with more to come. The member for Franklin (Mr Quick), the colleague behind me, knows that the Liberal government in Tasmania has reduced funding. Western Australia has reduced funding.

          , I would like to comment on four of the seven major matters raised. They are positive parenting, best practice in schools, data collection in schools and early intervention. Parents are key partners in education. Their role as primary educators of their children and their continuing support during the years of schooling are critical elements in ensuring successful outcomes from their children's education. Along with those statements, the Commonwealth government recognises the pivotal role that parents need to play in strategies to tackle violence in schools.

          No-one in this chamber would disagree with the sentiments of the government's response, but what exactly is positive parenting? What are the fundamental and essential attributes? I spent 25 years of my working life as a teacher and a principal of primary-aged children and obviously I came across children predisposed to verbal and physical violence and antisocial behaviour. In dealing with those children and their parents, I learned by experience and analysis of what happened that certain characteristics were always common. The child always had a parent or parents whose own behaviour and relationship with the child were dominated by inconsistency. Let me try and explain with a few real life examples.

          I remember a child whose parents were obviously part of the alternative society. In that family there were very few, if any, rules other than that, if a problem arose, a situational negotiation took place to attempt to solve it. The parents' dress and behaviour was often remarked on in the community as outlandish, and I am sure that the parents in question enjoyed their shock on the local community with quiet humour. However, the point I want to make is that the child was very well adjusted indeed, and in fact was a real asset to the school community. From the child's point of view—and that is often overlooked—his parents, in their behaviour and relationship with him, were totally consistent, fair, predictable, and providing the child with the necessary security and certainty in dealing with everyday situations, without the need to resort to verbal or physical violence.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I also experienced examples at the other end of the spectrum from that laissez-faire example. Another child I remember had parents who had a rule for everything and a punishment that, without exception, was always carried out if a rule was transgressed. It was a very strict household but, as with the laissez-faire family, I would not try to emulate it myself. Nevertheless, the child from that strict family was extremely well adjusted. Again, from the child's point of view, his parents were fair, consistent and totally predictable—even if I thought they were too strict.

          In other words, whether parents were strict or laissez-faire or somewhere in between did not seem to matter, as long as the relationship was consistent between the parents and the child. It also did not seem to matter—and this goes against a lot of the research—whether the child was a girl or a boy. Gender issues did not matter. Socioeconomic status did not seem to matter. Religious, cultural or racial status did not matter.

          By contrast, and without exception, all children I have dealt with who were predisposed to violence had a parent or parents unable or unwilling to develop a relationship with their offspring that could be described as consistent. The result was children whose sense of self-worth was confused, diminished, or even inflated; whose relationships with other children and adults were marked with conflict; and whose skills in dealing with often everyday trivial circumstances were minimal. The point I make about positive parenting, and I much prefer to call it `consistent' parenting, is that the views of children themselves must be valued and acknowledged.

          Although I welcome the government's response on initiatives to ask parent groups to provide advice about the role schools should play in promoting positive parenting, and I acknowledge the positive parenting approach underpinning the national prevention strategy for child abuse and neglect—as well as a major community education campaign and an independent assessment of all major parenting programs currently delivered in Australia—that information will never be complete or effectual, and will provide a poor framework for policy if the views of children themselves are ignored. All the partners in the relationships between children and adults need to be considered, and to leave children out of the equation is totally unacceptable and downright foolhardy.

          There are many schools in this country which, in different ways, exemplify outstanding behaviour and school management—and then there are others in both the private and the public system. I find it very hard to accept that, after well over 100 years of compulsory education in Australia, some things have simply not changed in many primary schools. The most remarkable aspect is the basic structure used in these schools: that is, one teacher is largely responsible for the school education of a class of around 30 children for 10 months of the year. That structure is repeated year in, year out, for seven years. It is too bad if there is a relationship breakdown or indifference between pupil and student; too bad if the teacher has neither the interest nor the skill in the four major curriculum areas of language—including a foreign language—mathematics, environmental studies and the expressive arts and physical education. In 25 years I have never seen a teacher expert in all of those areas; the expectation that any teacher could be is totally unrealistic.

          Thirty years ago, some primary teachers could get away with basic English, simple arithmetic, a bit of history and geography, music lessons from a radio broadcast, a pastel lesson once a week and a game in the park. But that curriculum structure is long gone; it has outlived its usefulness. Today, primary teachers are expected to teach all aspects of language, including a foreign language. They are expected to teach all aspects of mathematics: sets, logic, graphing, basic algebra, geometry and numeration. They are expected to be up to date with computer and information technology. They are expected to teach health and science. They are expected to teach environmental studies. They are expected to be aware of behaviour management, gender issues, sociology, psychology, collaborative learning and to be sensitive to cultural and racial matters. The list goes on and on.

          Children need to be skilfully exposed to all of that curriculum. No-one would disagree with that contention. The problem is that no one teacher has the interest or the skills to do what is expected. The expectation from the community and government that teachers should do this is patently ridiculous. It is too bad if you are a child with a teacher whose interests and skills differ—you are stuck. Bored and uninterested students are potentially violent and anti-social students. Students unable to succeed in their chosen areas are potentially violent and anti-social students. Students unable to develop a positive relationship with a teacher, because of different interests or personality, are potentially violent and anti-social students.

          The chief determinant of a successful school will always be a quality education program, enhanced by the principal's leadership, in which a group of teachers—not individuals—with complementary skills and interests are responsible for children: that is, the children in any school year will be exposed to several teachers and not just one. However, with the teacher resources available in most primary schools, that is not possible. In many cases it cannot even be considered. But in the few schools that do expose children to a range of teachers, what do we find? We find that behaviour management is a very minor issue. It does not matter whether they are middle class or working class or top-of-the-range schools. Interested, motivated, happy, enthusiastic students do not become behaviour problems, irrespective of their home circumstances.

I would also say that it reflected the professionalism that he brings into this chamber in view of his 25 years of experience in the teaching profession. I was very appreciative of the illustrations he brought from the experiences he had had as an educator.

          I am not one who has had any professional involvement in education at all. But I have, in common with other people in the chamber, an interest in what education is all about; because I am, in common with most others, a parent. As a parent all too frequently absent from the role that ought to be exercised in the education of children—and that is a frustration we all face as members of the federal parliament—I nonetheless have endeavoured to be familiar with what was happening to my children in schools. I have been advantaged by the fact that my wife was herself, prior to the children arriving, a secondary school teacher, and that she is therefore anxious to ensure that their education is of the highest order. She has always kept me briefed on what she thought were the various strengths and weaknesses of their education and of the schools they were attending.

          —and I am not on the standing committee, so I was not directly involved in its preparation—what impressed me most was that violence is not a regular feature of Australian school life. That was an observation I expected to be able to make, because my children have not been any more exposed to bullying and violent behaviour than I was 40 years ago, as illustrated by the comments by member for Port Adelaide. In fact, as other members would be aware, the reports of antisocial and violent behaviour in New South Wales schools affected, it was alleged, only 0.04 per cent of students. In the case of ACT schools, in 1991 the number of suspensions was 447 out of 40,000 students, representing 0.01 per cent.

          My observations are that my children are no more exposed to verbal harassment and physical harassment than I was—and, in fact, probably less so. I think that children have a right, as everyone else would agree, to attend a school feeling safe and secure, being reassured that they will not be belittled, and to feel that, in the school environment, they will have a real opportunity for their own self-esteem to be enhanced. If there is one thing that has been brought home to me as a parent, it is that the self-esteem of individual children is of fundamental importance.

          The honourable member for Port Adelaide reinforced this not only with the illustrations he used from his own experience but also with the comments he made as a professional. If people feel they have self-worth and feel they have a contribution to make to society, it is highly unlikely that they will be involved in violent behaviour. I have only one problem with the honourable member for Port Adelaide's comments. He said that interested, motivated, enthusiastic students do not become problems regardless of their home background. I expect he is right; however, very few interested, motivated, enthusiastic students come out of a difficult home background.

          —Rather than debate this across the chamber, we can pick it up later. I am merely making the observation that it is much easier to be an interested, motivated and enthusiastic student if the parents have already cultivated that sense of enthusiasm at home. I well remember what for me was the most terrorising book I have read. I read it very early in my primary school days, which was probably a mistake. I was amused by one of my colleagues who observed the other day that the best three years of his life had been spent in year one—that was a mischievous remark. I remember that it was not long after I acquired the capacity to read that someone gave me the book

          For most of us, some sort of verbal harassment and, I suspect, for most of our generation, some physical harassment was a reality of the schools in which we grew up. That did not make it defensible, but it was a reality, and I suspect that exhibits itself less frequently today than it did in my own day.

          From my experience as a parent, bullying and harassment is less of a feature of all-girls schools than it is of all-boys schools. My children spent their primary school years in public schools. They spent their secondary schooling in private schools, with the exception of one child, who had two years of his secondary schooling in a public school. From my daughter's experience in an all-girls school in Adelaide, it was the best thing we did for her. Her sense of self-esteem was enhanced and there was relatively little physical bullying. Of course, there was some verbal bullying that characterises what we would loosely call—and I use the term advisedly—the `bitchiness' of an all-girls school environment.

          On the other hand, my oldest son for the latter part of his secondary schooling went to an all-boys school where bullying was more a part of the scene—and we all know what goes on at all-boys schools. As a result of his experience, we have sent our younger son to a school catering for both sexes. Lest it be thought that I am being critical of the schooling experience of my older son, I should say that, in confronting the headmaster with our decision not to send our younger son there, I was impressed with what had been done in the intervening years by that school community to address the problem of both bullying and verbal abuse. I frame my remarks this morning around the fact that I believe that, without exception, switched-on schools are doing something about bullying and verbal abuse.

          I pick up the remarks made by the member for Port Adelaide. I entirely agree with him that it does not matter whether it is a private school or a public school; what is happening in violence in schools is very much a reflection on the principal and the staff of a school. My own view of the public school system has been that my children were being well served there by teachers who deserved to be paid twice the salary they were being paid, because of the effort they put into effectively parenting at school, and were served there by other teachers who were not worth feeding and who could not be disciplined in an effective way.

          I have no doubt the member for Port Adelaide faced some of this frustration as a principal when he had staff members for whom he wanted to offer a greater remuneration and was unable to do so, and staff members whom he would gladly have shown the front gate but was unable to do so. And that has been one of the difficulties that I felt has characterised the public school system more markedly—not exclusively but more markedly—than the private school system. What is important for all of us is to ensure that our children, both at home and at school, have a real sense of self-worth and self-importance. Any form of bullying, whether it is physical or verbal, breaks that down and does untold damage that takes a long time to address.

          I want to pick up the recommendations that were made to the minister and his response. I am not quite as enthusiastic as the member for Port Adelaide about data collection, though I clearly recognise his professionalism in this area. My attitude comes rather as an observing parent. The first recommendation was that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, in consultation with state and territory ministers for education, fund the evaluation of successful approaches adopted by schools to determine the best practice, and that the result of that evaluation be published and disseminated. This recommendation was encouraging the ministers to hold a series of forums and to thoroughly consider the practices that were working effectively in schools.

          That recommendation ran parallel to the second recommendation, which was that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training finance the development of a national school violence data collection system referred to by the member for Port Adelaide. My own view was that, frankly, it is not this sort of data that we need as much as we need concerned parents anxious to ensure that at home there is a positive home environment to reinforce the positive environment that we would seek to cultivate in schools. It may well be that data collection is necessary, but I fear that data collection of itself achieves very little and I would not want the resources funnelled into data collection to be at the expense of resources that we could make available to encourage young parents to be more effective and more positive parents and to take the assets they have in children and build them up and give them a greater sense of self-esteem.

          The third recommendation was that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training discuss with state and territory ministers the need for early intervention strategies to address violent and anti-social behaviour in students. We would all agree with that. I think it is important that students' capacity to live with others, to cooperate with others and to recognise the worth of others is inculcated at an early age, because the later it gets the harder it is to develop the sort of human behaviour techniques that we would want to encourage.

          The next recommendation was that the Minister for Communications and the Arts examine the effects of television, video, film and video games on the learning outcomes and behaviour of Australian children. This is a recommendation that has largely been endorsed by people on both sides of this chamber, and the plea has been for greater recognition of the damage that violent television viewing can do to young minds. It is the reason we have some sort of categorisation system and it is the reason all of us, as concerned parents, are very anxious to ensure that our children do not see the sort of movies that we would not want them to see. The problem we face, once again, is where there has been family breakdown and there is not the same level of intervention in children's viewing.

          I pick up the interesting remark made by the member for Port Adelaide about a family experience he had had where the parents were rather laissez-faire in their approach to upbringing and the children were nonetheless well adjusted because the children knew the parents cared. The secret, of course, is in reassuring parents and children, where they are in a disciplined house, or what we would call a relatively non-disciplined house, that mum and dad are worried about their outcome. In that sort of environment, what they view is conditioned by mum and dad's attitude anyway. It is to those who grow up in families where mum and dad clearly appear not to care that the damage is truly done.

          Finally, I turn to the recommendation that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training review the attendance and performance eligibility criteria for Austudy for students in years 11 and 12. I represent an electorate in which Austudy is a major problem. The major problem is not that the criteria are unfair. In fact, having spent a lot of time following up Austudy cases, I am not a critic of the way in which the government administers it. The problem that I face—and it is a problem the government is familiar with—is in terms of people who remain asset rich and, particularly in recent times, cash poor.

          I do not have a simple solution to make Austudy available to those in rural areas who have assets that they cannot readily dispose of because they need them in order to run an effective business when, in this case, the drought is over. However, no doubt there are many cases where the capacity to educate children is directly affected by the unavailability of Austudy. I encourage the government to look at the way in which Austudy is administered, particularly in rural areas. A number of people are denied it because of their assets, but they are unable to offer their children in years 11 and 12 and in tertiary education the sort of education those children need. This builds up frustration, which can lead to violent behaviour.

We are taken to universities, technical colleges and institutes of further education and we are overwhelmed by the technological impact of what we see. Thus, we think that we should fund those areas. However, when we go into a grade 1 class and see a young teacher with 30 young children in front of her imparting knowledge, values, ideals and basic learning techniques, we cannot see any benefit. It is all theoretical. It is only 10 years later that the impact of what has or has not been done in those very formative years becomes obvious.

          The manifestation of violence or anti-social behaviour within the precincts of schools very often has nothing to do with what is happening in the educative process of the child. But because it does happen in schools, teachers, students, social workers and parents are forced to intervene in order to impose some order. Very often due to inadequate resources they are never able to properly address the real reason behind the violent outburst.

          I would like to provide honourable members with some first-hand true anecdotes of such anti-social behaviour to highlight and complement the recommendations from the report and the government's response to them. The first example is of young Brian. I well remember him coming to school. Not long after we had started work early in the morning in the grade 4 class he violently and without provocation assaulted one of his classmates. I had been teaching for quite a few years at that stage and sensed that something was not quite right. Because he trusted me, after some reluctance and embarrassment on his part and having been withdrawn from the rest of the class, he tearfully explained to me the reason behind his outburst. By the way, it was a very hot day and it was rather unusual that he was wearing a polo-neck jumper.

          He finally peeled back the jumper to show me the cuts on his neck where his mother's boyfriend had used a knife to assert his authority over the young child. Brian's mum had just had a new baby by the boyfriend and Brian really was not wanted as part of the new family. He came to school angry and frustrated and hit out at the first person that he came in contact with.

That was possible only because we had the resources there and because the teachers fostered a caring atmosphere in the school.

          As the inquiry noted, the community at large is becoming increasingly concerned about violence in schools.

          It was interesting to note that when the inquiry was in full swing only the states of South Australia and Queensland and the territory of the ACT bothered to make submissions. It was rather disappointing that in the case of my state, Tasmania, rather than get involved in the inquiry, the government handed the task over to a Tasmanian education council to do its own special report. Its report consequently dwelt on the problem from an educational perspective in total isolation. The announcement on the solving of the problem was to provide an additional teacher to every secondary school and college to handle disruptive students. To me, that is far too late.

          Surely, as a society, we have two issues to address: firstly, to put in place programs to solve the current problems; and, secondly, to ensure that we have in place strategies which will reduce the number of children leaving primary schools who are still at risk. Just to address the first issue is self-defeating. The numbers keep on rising and the problems will surely escalate to what is happening overseas, especially in the United States of America. I have had the privilege—doubtful though it might be—of actually working in schools there, and I know exactly what the problems are that they face: they are horrendous.

          In all states, as the member for Port Adelaide mentioned, education departments have initiated large cutbacks, especially in the area of support staff. I think it is vital that all primary schools have a full quota of specialist teachers. In most schools in Tasmania—in primary schools—there are in excess of $70,000 or $80,000 of library books and no librarians. There are no music, phys. ed. or special ed. teachers, and those kids are at risk.

Their best practice school behaviour, peer support and development of a school-wide ethos of non-violence must be extended throughout the nation. Part 1.12 in the report states:

         All these sound so simple and so self evident, but I can assure members that these criteria are missing in many schools throughout our nation. I can take members to a school close to my electorate office where the primary school principal refuses to allow parents to become involved in his school. There are schools where caning is still meted out to deter anti-social behaviour. These activities are knowingly condoned by the education departments.

          In my electorate I am delighted to say that we have some visionary teachers who, despite all the setbacks, have some wonderful early intervention programs. I would like to take this opportunity to note them in public: Herdsmans Cove Primary School and the excellent work of Doreen Lutjens in running an early intervention program pre-school for in excess of 60 parents and about 90 children; Geilston Bay High School under Trevor Rootes; Rugby High School under Greg Cairnduff; Geeveston District High School and the excellent work in the Star program by Greg Suitor; Bridgewater High School and the tireless work in the intervention process by Graham Speight; and, Peter Marmion and his wonderful staff at Franklin Primary School.

          I also welcome the federal government's support for a series of forums on schools held in each state and territory. I think it is essential that, rather than having the bureaucrats and the experts as the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) mentioned, we identify these best practice schools, document what they are doing, have them talk together and then follow up the key findings of these forums and develop policies, programs and performance indicators based on their best practice activities. These best practice schools do have the answers. We need the bureaucrats from the education department and from the departments of community welfare, health, housing, sport and recreation, and community services, to be able to listen in and find out just how important their roles are in this process. It is not just an issue solely related to education. To highlight this need for an interdepartmental approach to this problem of violence in schools, I would like to place on record the wonderful work that is happening in the northern suburbs of Adelaide.

He used to feed kittens to his german shepherd to get his kicks. He delighted in hurting young people and girls. We fought in vain to involve the necessary support personnel in Jimmy's case but there always seemed to be someone with a more pressing need.

          Throughout the inquiry the committee constantly heard about the need for early intervention and support for families so that they could deal with the problem of violence in schools. I welcome the government's very supportive and constructive response to the recommendations concerning the piloting of positive parenting programs and the examination of the manner in which government services are delivered to students and families requiring support from more than one agency. The development by state and territory governments of a youth strategy coordinating committee is welcome news. However, one hopes and prays that there will be more benefits flowing from this committee than from the youth affairs departments which each state has—usually attached to the Premier's office—and which were supposedly set up to monitor such issues.

          Nevertheless, I have some reservations about the government's response, and I will deal with those reservations. From the outset, I must say that one of the early disappointments was the way in which the government glossed over the connection between violence and bullying. It is very important that this difference is noted. The committee was able to differentiate, as it moved around Australia, that bullying is becoming more prevalent and that overt violence, if anything, is becoming somewhat less prevalent.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It is interesting to note that, while acts of overt physical violence are rare events in most schools, bullying is prevalent. Australian research found that one child in seven reports being bullied at least once a week by other children at school. While the distribution of bullying amongst schools is uneven, in some schools it is as high as one in four. That information is contained in an extract from the report of the committee.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          As I said, the incidence of overt violence seems to be on the decrease, at least within the schoolyard. The committee found evidence of overt violence outside the schoolyard, but it also found that bullying is a much more profound occurrence, and, in a way, it is much more insidious. This point was made to the committee by the New South Wales Teachers Federation, which pointed out that, in three-quarters of a million students, there are only 50 to 100 incidents of actual physical violence per semester. Although that would not appear to be a big problem, bullying is prevalent across the spectrum.

          The National Committee on Violence, in its report
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

          , said it agreed that:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

        <para>
         So, at this point, we need to move on to where we feel the distinction lies. This is where the bulk of the work must be concentrated—at that fine point between violence and bullying. In our report, we defined bullying as:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . repeated and unprovoked negative behaviour (both physical and non-physical) directed by more powerful students or groups of students against less powerful students.
        </para>
        <para>
         However, we went on to say that what seemed to affect the extent to which bullying occurred was the extent to which school staff were involved in the students' lives. Here we discovered quite a distinction as between schools and I believe this distinction revolved around how well the holistic school approach was applied to student behaviour.

         It is interesting that two of the best schools we found in that regard had invoked all or most of those particular key points. It is also interesting that my colleague opposite, the member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith), is here because we found that the Mayfield Primary School in Launceston was one of the best examples, among primary schools, of the adoption of that school regime.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Another interesting aspect of this, which was touched on by other speakers earlier in the debate, was the quality of leadership within the school. We found that in Mayfield—as we did at the next school I wish to refer to, which is the Patrician Brothers High School at Granville in the western suburbs of Sydney. This old school is not unlike the ones we used to see in the old English films—the two- or three-storey brick schools surrounded by asphalt courtyards with very little in the way of sporting facilities. The school is in what you would have to describe charitably as one of the more depressed parts of the western suburbs of Sydney, 76 per cent of the students come from ethnic backgrounds, and yet it was arguably the best school we came across in our study.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Again, the reason was that these key pointers we identified were largely invoked in that school. For example, one of the requirements of a teacher being on the staff was that he or she—be they religious or lay teachers—had to participate in the pastoral care of the students. There was a regime of respect—this idea of privilege and responsibility—and that was demonstrated very clearly in a rule that the school had invoked. That was that there was to be no touching of another student, other than at contact sport. In other words, everyone had to respect everyone else's space. There was also a great sense of family both within the school and with the involvement of the students' families from outside the school.

          While I have never been a great believer in corporal punishment, I never go to the extent of saying that we should deny all schools in all circumstances the right to administer limited corporal punishment. Although corporal punishment was not administered in this school very often, when I questioned a group of 29 students I asked the worst boy how often he would be punished by the strap. He said, `Perhaps two or three times a year.' People would hardly say that that was a violent atmosphere in that school. Interestingly, it put an ultimate sanction into the system.

          Sometimes, in this age of anti-corporal punishment, we have gone too far to the other end of the spectrum in allowing teachers or principals to exercise a right which may prevent worse behavioural problems. If the right to administer corporal punishment came from the degree of control, happiness and general wellbeing that was in a school, then this principal earned the right to administer it because he certainly had a school which, against all odds, was a great example.

          Moving on to the government's response to the committee's recommendations, notably that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, in conjunction with the state and territory ministers, find an evaluation of successful approaches which might lead to best practice, the government has said that it would set up a steering committee for the dissemination of results in this field and that it might consider an award system for schools that show leadership. I commend that particular recommendation.

          The government also acknowledged our recommendation that the minister, in conjunction with his state and territory ministerial colleagues, develop a school violence data collection system—I am paraphrasing the recommendation. I do not have any hang-ups about this and about privacy. It is just raw data. The minister has delegated that to the statistics task force of the ministerial council, the MCEETYA. We also had the recommendation that the minister, with his state and federal colleagues, look at early intervention strategies to address violence and anti-social behaviour.

          As we worked through the ministerial responses, I had a feeling, as a previous speaker mentioned, that while the government was sensitive to the committee's needs in theory, there was not much happening in practice. Again, it was referred to a ministerial council, and to the committee, saying that it was to reassess the level of Commonwealth recurrent funding to government primary schools. If the government set up this inquiry, gave this committee a reference and went broad-ranging across all of Australia, it could not hide its response in the great litany of programs, many of them most commendable, that are in the addendum to its response on the one hand, nor can it say that it is going to fix it up by a series of ministerial councils. It is going to have to have some hard edged contribution from the Commonwealth. That may mean some form of direct government funding or funding through ministerial councils for specific projects.

          I am not satisfied with the government's response to effects of television, video film, video games, et cetera, on learning outcomes and behaviour. The fact that there is an overlap between the Department of Communications and the Arts and the Department of Employment, Education and Training is not a sound basis for stepping away from this problem. Did we not all last Sunday hear the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) say, with his new-found zeal for a fourth family television channel, that the current fare being dished up to families was largely—and I use his own words—`American bilge'.

          In the time remaining to me, I would like to touch for a few moments on the link between violence and educational outcomes. The government has said in its report that it believes the causes of violence in schools are many and varied, and it notes that any causal links between literacy and violence are not well established. I do not think that that is a fair assessment. There may not have been many great causal links between smoking and lung cancer, initially, but there was a lot of anecdotal evidence that should have been acted on. I think this holds true here, because further on in the report, where the government quotes the Star program, it goes on to say that the improvement of basic literacy, numeracy and social skills necessary for students to function in society, raising their self-esteem and skills for coping with conflict and aggression, was an essential feature. But the government cannot say, on the one hand, that there is no causal effect, and then quote its own Star program saying that there is.

          Our schools must be able to provide a safe learning environment for our children. That environment must be a caring environment, an environment that establishes firm behavioural limits, where students' rights are clearly demonstrated and their responsibilities are clearly stated.

The media, in its reporting of often very singular and isolated incidents, has often blown this issue out of all proportion, and has perhaps contributed to the community perception that our education system is violent or chaotic.

          Throughout the deliberation of the committee, it was found that there are many schools where the principals have shown, and are showing, strong leadership—especially in those instances where there has been recognition that violent behaviour can be changed. These schools have developed a whole school approach to addressing school violence, alongside ensuring that their students are very much aware of their rights. Major importance has been placed on students taking responsibility for themselves and others, as well as on teachers taking their responsibility.

         As we conducted our inquiry, it became quite evident that there were schools operating under a best practice system with a whole school approach—in particular, when dealing with violence in the school environment. I will take the time to quote part of the report itself. The honourable member for Hinkler, who spoke previously, mentioned the Mayfield School in my electorate of Bass. When we visited Mayfield, the committee did so with my encouragement, as the school had not proffered a submission; but I knew what was going on there from close contact with that school, and I was determined that the inquiry and the committee should see that there was a program in place where a whole school approach had been taken to look at this issue.

          Mayfield Primary School drew its student population from family situations where 70 per cent of parents were unemployed. Mayfield is a very depressed suburb of Launceston in many ways—and, I might add, a suburb where I spent a couple of years of my own life. As recently as four years ago, the playground of that school was considered unsafe. The introduction of the supportive school environment approach eliminated these problems.

          The program which operated in the school was not an isolated program but an integral part of every aspect of school life. There was recognition by the principal and teachers that violent behaviour could be changed, and their dedication to effecting that change largely contributed to the turnaround in behaviour which the school experienced. The program endeavoured to promote the wellbeing of all those who worked within the school community. Throughout the program, children in particular learnt skills in behaviour management and conflict resolution. Students learned mutual respect and cooperation. Students in year 6 provided guidance and support for younger pupils, and all students were responsible for observing and reporting incidents which were contrary to the philosophy of the school.

          The school had developed a clear set of rights, as well as of responsibilities. These were developed between the teachers, pupils and parents, and were considered to be owned by the whole school community. The school developed rules that related to learning, movement, treatment, problem solving, safety, and talking and communication. While there was concern about the lack of resources, the environment in the school was improved immeasurably—without the allocation of additional resources.

          This school had clearly stated consequences for behaviour. These consequences were positive for positive behaviour, and negative for inappropriate behaviour. The rules were also applied consistently. In all academic streams, the children were taught appropriate behaviour as an integral part of the teaching process. As an ex-schoolteacher, I know that has been the philosophy in my life: we need guidelines for our young people so that they know what the parameters of behaviour are. They also need to know that they may have to pay some price if they overstep those parameters.

          The committee was also keen to note that principals, teachers and community groups identified violence via the media, film, video games and negative modelling. That was one that came in quite unawares to the committee. In particular, via the media, a lot of negative modelling from some of the negative behaviour of our sports heroes has influenced how children react. I am sure we are all aware of that. They see their peers and their role models doing something and they think it is okay for them to do it as well.

          First I would like to say a few words about the history of our schooling system over the last 20 or 25 years, in my experience of it. You, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, are a former teacher and many former teachers bring their professional background and their understanding of educational issues into the parliament. I bring a somewhat different perspective, as someone who experienced the education system for only about 10 years of my life.

          However, in my early adult experience of the education systems, as my children were growing up, I became aware that the education system had approximately a doubling of the resources in the early 1970s and a doubling of the staffing, as the government of the day saw that as a priority. I guess the promise in those times was that, if we could put more resources into education, we would reap a reward. Looking back over that 20- to 25-year period, however, at best we could say that the results were mixed. I offer one statistic—the youth unemployment statistic.

          We might look back over the last few years and say that there are certain areas where the resources are limited and where resources have been reduced. But if we look at the span of history, especially over the last 20 or 30 years, we find that there has been a very significant taxpayer contribution to education. I have to say that some of the social issues around that expenditure bear greater scrutiny.

          What happened in that time was we had the three Rs being taught in the general curriculum of the day, which was seen to be appropriate. Then we saw more social experimentation, if you like. We got into a range of extra activities and put greater burdens on schools. Sadly, at the same time, parents were left out in the cold. I make these comments in preface to my remarks on this report because I think we have to see the report, and where our schooling system is at, in the context not just of the last few years but of a generation or two.

          As I said, parents were left out in the cold. As time went on, those in the teaching profession found that the load got too heavy. Parents were important after all. Parents were not just nuisances to be sidelined and prevented from being involved in the lives—and, particularly, the education—of their children. The moral self-righteousness that not all but many teachers had in those early years of enthusiasm in the 1970s gave way to a greater realisation that it was a full team and full community approach, that there were, indeed, limitations to what the schools could achieve, and limitations to the role of our teachers, that schools should not just be a social experiment, and that families were important in the overall situation. Gradually, as time has gone on, there has been a lesser expectation of what schools can achieve and of their role in society.

Our schools should not be involved too much in what is deigned to be `politically correct' from a particular perspective. There should not be excessive denigration and ridicule of a person's value judgments, religious beliefs or, indeed, political beliefs.

          The atmosphere of a greater political tolerance that I hope might be emerging in our education system brings us to the topic of the day—the violence in schools report and the government's response. Violence in schools is, of course, only indicative of the greater violence in the wider community. Children are great mimics. We must remember this when forming any anti-violence policies for children. We must remember that children are just reflecting what they see around them, and they are highly influenced by family, friends, television and other segments of society. In that, of course, we must include the education system, their teachers and their friends and peers at school.

          The previous speaker, the member for Bass (Ms Sylvia Smith), made the point that I was going to make about the 18,000 murders that children may view on television in their first 14 or 16 years of life. If it were not for television and other forms of entertainment, how much experience of murders would children have? Of course, we would all say, `Very little or none, except perhaps some information from books and newspapers.' Therefore, clearly, television and movies have a very significant influence on bringing the world of violence into the homes of children. It is that casual exposure that, after a while, we need to understand far more, as a nation.

          The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made some comments about a family TV channel, and maybe the idea has some worthy notions around it. It appears that his idea is called highly impractical, inherently unlikely, and ill-thought through. Be that as it may, the Prime Minister makes a reasonable point that the exposure of the family and of young children to these sorts of programs is something that the nation should be more aware of.

          Parents, of course, are concerned about the level of violence on television, particularly violence in cartoons and in daytime programs which are especially for children. Violent programs often have their own line of merchandise in toy stores, allowing young children to dress up as their heroes and to re-enact the violent behaviour they have seen on television. Children are simply being exploited in the violence industry, and parents cannot constantly monitor what their children are watching.

          We have come to the question of what governments can do. In my earlier comments I touched on the span of history over the last 20 to 25 years. The index shows that we have expended a significant amount of resource into our education system. The previous speaker, the member for Bass, mentioned a school in her electorate which the committee visited. Although I was not able to be involved at that time, I make the point that the committee found that extra funding does not necessarily ensure the success of an anti-violence campaign in schools. The point which I make with reference to that particular school in Tasmania is that a successful anti-violence campaign was put into place without extra funding. It is an issue, but, as the report and the response acknowledges, it is not extreme. However, it is something that we need to understand more about.

          The issue of Austudy is raised in the report. I support the comments of the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) when he said that there is a need for greater recognition of the problems in regional Australia. Regional Australia is going through massive adjustment—more so, I suggest, than most of metropolitan Australia. The people who live in regional Australia are primarily less well-off than people in the metropolitan areas of our country, and I represent one of the electorates in regional Australia. Access to education represents the main opportunity for the people who live in regional Australia to break out of the very severe adjustment process that has been going on out there over the last decade or so. We must, in the Austudy situation, recognise the extra costs and the pressures which these people have. It is now clearly recognised by almost everybody that rural students are the most disadvantaged of all students when it comes to accessing tertiary studies. I believe that the general issue of violence is very much tied up with the necessity for a broader educational understanding of the issue and in giving people greater opportunities. The regional Australian needs to be recognised much more so than was the case in the past.

It is about quality TV, and I despair a bit in relation to that when I think about all the new channels that might start to enter homes in the future. The quality of all that cable TV could be something that we as a parliament will need to deal with in the future. I think there will be a lot of junk on it and it will come back. I was quite heartened by being able, on another committee, to visit the Australian Children's Television Foundation and see the work that it does in children's programming in this country.

          I was disappointed in the comments that it had not been established that there was a causal link between literacy and violence and therefore there was no link. I think that was a little short-sighted. For sure, if people cannot read and write it does not mean that they are, by definition, violent people, but an inability to communicate, on top of all the other frustrations that life can offer, must lead to expression in other ways. That can mean aggression, diversion, evasion and, if none of those work, violence. We need only to look as far as our gaols to see how many people in there have low literacy skills—a very high percentage.

          I recently participated in a seminar on youth suicide in my electorate that was set up to learn why so many young people, particularly adolescent boys, had found it necessary to harm themselves or kill themselves. This finding had come out of a study in Tasmania. I have also been reading in the press about how girls are now becoming the high achievers in schools, which is adding to the pressure on young males. We, as a society, are putting pressure on our children that can be so untenable that they can only see the `final' solution—the bottle of barbiturates or the end of a gun.

          I found the visits to the Northern Territory very expanding. So was the information that was taken, even within my own state and especially at the school of Mayfield in the Bass electorate. The work done there all came back to very strong and good leadership, and a commitment from the whole community, as well as the school community, to achieve goals. I found that in just about every school that I have looked at: where there is good leadership and good support from the community and from parents, you will find good support and a good achievement rate. I look forward to the recommendations that the government has undertaken to implement, and to following those through.

The member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and I are both members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and we were signatories to a minority report on the Main Committee in which we indicated a number of concerns about how this may operate. We still have a number of concerns about aspects of it, in particular about the fact that, apart from occasional visits, there never appear to be instances where ministers are available to sum up the debate. I would have thought that that would have been very important in ensuring that the Main Committee enjoys an equal standing—or, if not equal, certainly a very high standing—as the second chamber of the House of Representatives. So I indicate the concern that a number of us have with that particular aspect of the conduct of this committee.

In fact, those who have taken an interest in literature, particularly some of the literature of the 19th century, would know that bullying and that type of violence was quite endemic in some schools. This was particularly so in the United Kingdom where the public school system was in full force. One looks back at
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Tom Brown's Schooldays
          </emphasis>
          and other similar works which describe a situation where bullying was an integral part of what was a very brutal and unpleasant schooling system, something which the author of that work was very keen to reform.

          So, in the first instance, we are dealing with something that has been going on ever since there have been schools and, in particular—because it happens to be a predominantly male problem—in schools with males in them. Of course, I acknowledge that it is a matter that affects both genders, but it particularly has been in the past, and I imagine it is predominantly now a problem among male students.

          With the Commonwealth taking an interest in this problem area, there are a number of issues that relate to the Commonwealth's role in the education system. When the member for Fremantle and Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) was minister for education in the Western Australian government, she made a particularly pertinent comment about going to a conference on education in Darwin. She made the comment that, on arrival, she found herself in the position where she was educating hundreds of thousands of students in the Western Australian education system and had three or four advisers with her from her department, while the Commonwealth minister, who educated no students whatsoever, fronted up with about 20 advisers. It was an interesting comment, coming from someone who is now a Commonwealth minister, because it reflects somewhat the attempts by the Commonwealth to make inroads into areas which are essentially state jurisdiction—quite substantially so.

          I was a policeman for nine years before I became a member of parliament, and I can say that the question of bullying at school and violence at school is a very difficult one indeed, particularly in relation to the investigation of particular offences and the treatment of complaints where people have been assaulted.

I note that particular remark and agree with it wholeheartedly. Within my particular electorate, with well over 66 schools—and I am talking about major schools—I have found time and time again that where there is good leadership in the school the management of these particular problems tends to be much more effective. Particularly effective is a cooperative leadership among the staff, the principal, the parents and, to a certain extent, the students themselves. A grassroots, whole school approach is required in the context of this problem of violence in schools.

          In all of the five years, the question of violence in school has never really arisen, and that somewhat surprises me when I read the report and some of the evidence of the submissions that were received by the committee. That is not to say that it is not a problem; I am just saying that the people on the committee that I run—and I take the trouble to canvass their views—have not once indicated that violence is a particular problem. They have indicated, however, that juvenile crime is a problem, and I think that there is a convergence between the problems of violence and juvenile crime. We know from the evidence around us in the community that the two groups most heavily affected by violence in the community are the young and the aged. In the case of the young, more often than not the violence is perpetrated by one of their own. So it is, I suppose, a peer problem.

It seems that assaults clearly deserve more stringent and substantial punishment. Because of a decline around the country in punishment being meted out, it seems that people have felt less constrained, less fearful, about the prospects of being detected and then punished as a consequence of their actions.

It is a very difficult role to play in this day and age because of the limited sanctions available to them to be able to deal with a very difficult problem. Mostly it is a problem that involves a very small minority and, as my own students in their committee identified, it is often a small recidivist group—to use a term that is perhaps a current one—who re-offend or commit the same offences over and over again. The students on my committee were very concerned about the unfortunate image young people have of being law-breakers, violent, or in some way less socially responsible. It is an unfortunate image because in 99 per cent of cases that is not the case. In newspapers and on television, we get to see only the extreme examples where some youngsters are identified as being problems to their local community with their antisocial behaviour.

I am very concerned about that.

I think it is to the Commonwealth's advantage to be an assisting and cooperating influence with the states to ensure that the problem of violence and bullying in schools is overcome.

          —Violence is the raw exertion of power. It is not confined to gender, race, or any of the other areas of conflict that exist between people. As a general rule, society needs to express how intolerable violence is to it. That can be expressed in a number of ways, as it should be with other intolerable aspects that pervade our society: racism, sexism and so on. But one needs to have some inner strength to be able to stand up to the mob. In politics, we are always faced with this issue as, for example, with the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994, where the vast majority of the House stood up against minorities and the minority viewpoint, in a conflict situation.

          My message is that it is an attitude. I will put that in the context of the government's role as referred to by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) in his summation. I think his suggestion that the Commonwealth does not have a role in specific programs has failed. I do not say this with any party political basis; I do it on a personal basis. I concede and bow to the honourable member for Moore's experience of police matters, since he worked for nine years in that job. I worked for 12 years in education as a librarian. I also went to both public and private schools for my schooling, in a heavily ethnic area. I saw the violence first-hand as a young male growing up in a school that was strictly split into four different groups. To be able to go through and mix with all of those groups, to stand up and say something against the violence and violent interaction, is a very hard thing to do. For young Australians in our schools to have the guts to stand up and say, when a fight is beginning to emerge in the playground, `Don't be stupid; pull your head in' there needs to be a backup from the staff and the rest of the pupils in that school.

          My attitude as a teacher when a fight erupted was to go in and collar the lot. Every person was treated in the same manner in terms of the punishments dished out by me. That included every observer. I would front a fracas, and everyone who was prepared to stand by, to allow it to take place and not object, I felt was partaking in it. In many instances, two frightened little boys or two frightened little girls would be pushed into a fight by a crowd egging them on. So we need to understand the nature of violence in schools.

          The previous speaker, the honourable member for Moore, as a former police officer, would understand that his job was only as good as the people who were around him. The community has to be behind him. That is what he referred to and I fully agree with his comments about parents and the broader community being involved. However, what I suggest—and that is what the government report seems to be hoping for—is an attitudinal change. When people incite racism for political purposes, or use ethnic groups in a political way to score points, or when people can or cannot speak about something because of fear of racism, I think the whole community, starting with politicians should not callously use those arguments and jump on those bandwagons.

          I was a teacher for 12 years. I went through public and private school education in a predominantly ethnic area. I am married to a Croatian who is now an Australian. I have heard my father-in-law called a wog. I understand these things. When we look at violence, we must look at the real causes. The report and the government's response have addressed the basic cause of violence. When the Australian Labor Party addressed the question of the number of women in parliament, it did it by setting targets and goals, achievable things, to make it happen, rather than letting rhetoric suffice.

          When we determined that we are going to take on Aboriginal affairs in this area and clean up 200 years of misgivings, we took it on and we led. We find elements in Western Australia and elements in the Northern Territory using base core racism, and we know which political parties they were a part of. When those opposite talk about violence and talk about keeping violence out of schools, I would suggest that what they should do is address the real issue. If they talk about leadership, their own behaviour should be involved. In terms of schools and violence, my experience at Wyrallah High School was that we had a whole staff of people who did everything that they could to promote an optimistic framework, but, as I first said, violence is a raw exertion of power. Schools and police are no different in that they exert power rawly at times, sometimes for very good reasons.

          As I said, violence is the raw exertion of power. Before the division I was about to speak of the police, any form of authority, of government itself. We were ringed around here with trucks. We had the potential to use violence as a raw exertion of power and bring in troops. I think there is not one of us here who would not suggest that, if we had brought in troops to move that blockade away, the outcome might have been violence. I think there are many of us who believe that the level of temperature amongst those troops out there might have been such that it would be that way. I am not trying to assert that in any way, but if we exerted raw power that would have been a response such as comes from human beings and animals. I do not think that most of us want to see that within our schools. The point I made before, the point that I have tried to reiterate, is that that needs to be part of our whole life and it needs to be an attitudinal thing. This government needs to take pro-active measures to put aside those levels of hatred in the community.

          One would have thought—this is of particular relevance to my family—when I was teaching at Warrawong High School, with every republic of the former Yugoslavia represented, during the conflict when war was raging, that there would have been violence in the school. One would have imagined that that would be the case. It was not the case, because the attitude of the teaching staff there was one of caring and of being non-tolerant of intolerance.

I will do all I can to make sure that the other person has the right to express those views but I will not do anything to assist. I will not make media platforms for such people to stand on. I reflect back to the attitudes and the behaviour of us here in this House, because if it starts with anyone, anyone who wants to open their mouth on this subject, it starts with that person.

          Mr Kennett, in Victoria, with a passionate plea to the Greek community, touched on something which I felt was extremely worrying in a country such as Australia. The debate about land bills and the divisions that we have just had in relation to the land fund bill, and the divisions that are projected because of that, do nothing for this nation. It is the community, the families that call themselves Australians, who should change the attitude. We lead through what we do. All of us should examine our own lives.

          I will mention two last things. I came in as a schoolteacher when canes were allowed to be used. I refused to use them. I had great difficulties in that environment getting through to students. When I asked one class, `What do I have to do to get you to work?' they called out in unison, `Cane us, sir. Cane us.' They were a product of the environment in which they lived. A lot of those teachers had a hell of a hard time when caning was taken away. But you do not respond to violence with violence.

          Sir Julius Chan has had the courage of his convictions in standing up and saying that capital punishment is not on. That man, I suggest, is showing leadership. If we want to look at leadership to take violence away from women, to take violence out of our relationships and our schools, then we look at our own attitudes. It starts with each and every one of us as individuals. I ask that, when we each responsibly put our metal to the earth, when we try to do our job, we do it with the conviction in our hearts that we will do that. Then we will change it. Then the government's response, be it with dollars or programs, will actually have some modicum of chance of winning. I thank the House.

        A small percentage of movements from JSA/NSA to other payments occur for reasons other than transfer, which may slightly increase the numbers in the right hand column. This may occur where clients have been in receipt of JSA/NSA, but are coded as a termination of that payment, rather than as a transfer to another payment.

        Regulation 308 of the CARs is a general exemption power.
