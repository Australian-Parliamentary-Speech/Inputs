         If we cannot run this place at a speed at which we can have employment growth, not only at least work force growth but beyond work force growth, so that we can bring down unemployment, what hope is there for the place? In fact, in the late 1980s when Australia had demand running at more than twice product growth, when GNE was running at 9 1/2 per cent and GDP was running at about 4 per cent, we saw demand spill into imports. We could not produce more than about 4 to 4 1/2 per cent GDP. I might say that that is after 30 years of coalition government.

         —Look, guys, I can understand your groaning because it is something to groan about. All the economies around us can do 6 to 8 per cent without spilling into imports. But the most we can do is what our capital stock would allow us; that is, to produce 4 per cent before all the demand spills into imports. We have been about trying to lift that productive capacity and rebuild the capital stock through the 1980s, which fell apart from about 1965 until the early 1980s. Apart from the mineral boom, which was investment in mining, in the rest of the economy, and certainly at the elaborate transformation of product, investment fell to pieces. So we could run the place at about 4 per cent per year, and that was about it.

         any problems with a forecast which shows 4 per cent-odd a year. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition actually said the other day that he would adopt the growth forecast and use the money to pay for tax cuts. It did not take him long. The Government's forecasts were out there for a couple of days and he decided he might adopt them and use the proceeds from that growth to spend on further tax cuts for Fightback mark II, which we know is rattling along in some accountant's office somewhere in Sydney and Melbourne.

         —The point is that we have been assiduously engaged in a trade liberalisation strategy which is about not only ensuring that manufacturing industry in Australia has the capacity to compete on the Australian market, but also that it has an export orientation, an interest and an incentive to export and earn export dollars, export income, for Australia. This is a highly respectable strategy for us to be adopting. It is a strategy which has been urged not only upon us but also upon others interested in trade liberalisation by the World Bank. It is one which not only involves a restructuring of industry assistance, such as tariffs and quotas, but also involves providing support more directly for exporters.

         In the Prime Minister's most recent statement we provided some additional resources for Austrade; some additional resources for the development import finance facility to allow for the export particularly of capital equipment; extra support for the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation; and increased support for the export access scheme. That is on top of the ongoing support which is provided through the export market development grants scheme which, in its own way, has been very helpful to exporters as they promote their exports and as they develop their export opportunities.

         The honourable member for Shortland asked me what has happened in the last 10 years. I think it is interesting to compare what has happened in the last five years with what happened in the five years leading up to the assumption of government by the Australian Labor Party. We find that in the last five years of the former Government manufactured exports were growing at just 4.2 per cent per year, whereas in the last five years they have grown to 7.2 per cent—almost a doubling of manufactured exports as a result of the success of our policies.

         Again, if we look at the area of sophisticated manufactured exports we find that under the old regime, that tired old regime which scrounged its way through the 1970s and into the early 1980s, export growth was 5 1/2 per cent, whereas under us in the last five years it has been growing at 15 per cent—three times as much as the annual growth of exports of sophisticated manufactured goods.

         This is an important change, and it is one which will continue in the future so long as there is the kind of appropriate support and the appropriate supportive policies that are necessary to continue that change. The Opposition, of course, pretends to be interested in manufacturing industry as it rips to zero every tariff and every other support mechanism in sight. Not only that, it is intent on ripping to bits those programs which also support our exporters more directly.

         The Opposition says that micro-economic change will make all the difference.

The honourable member for Barker may have got it right when he said—I quote from the

        That is the way in which he intends that we should make better use of and provide better opportunities for our exporters. In even more illuminating fashion, he went on to say that by 1995 there will be little need for an export market development grant scheme or others like it.

         Here we have a hidden part of the consumption tax package of the Opposition. Nowhere has it said that it would eliminate these programs. But, of course, the honourable member for Barker has let the cat out of the bag. Here is another half a billion dollars worth of programs which the Opposition intends to get rid of because it says that Australian exporters will not need them by 1995, as a result of the implementation of two pages of policy, out of the 800. It is not surprising. We have had, since Federation—

That is the way I took that remark. I might point out to the honourable member for O'Connor, as I did to the honourable member for Deakin and the Leader of the National Party, that many Speakers in the past have complained that the House has not put time limits on answers. I point out to the honourable member for O'Connor and other honourable members on his side and the Government side that governments and oppositions have not imposed time limits. The situation at present is that there are not time limits on answers. The Minister is answering the question; the Minister is in order; the Minister has the call.

         —The notion is that if a government volunteers to return fiscal drag to taxpayers—that is, the impact of inflation on the tax scales—that is to pay it as though it needed to be funded. What is this notion? It is that the incidence of inflation on the tax system raises the incidence of tax on taxpayers. The Government gives it back, but it has to be funded. Funded from what? Cuts in government spending, eh? You are a silly bunch, are you not? When I put the question to you, you all just smile and look silly. That is okay. We have dispensed with that little bit of nonsense about funding and unfunding. As to interest rates, the results of the tax cuts of 1989, which Senator Walsh also referred to, gave us a large part of that low inflation rate we have today.

         to produce; when there were shortages of labour; when pressure was on the accord and the inflation rate; and when employers were offering 12 to 15 per cent wage settlements—had those tax cuts not been there, instead of coming through this recessionary period from a peak of about 6 or 7 per cent inflation, we would have begun at about 11 or 12 per cent. Instead of being at 1 1/2 per cent now, we would more likely be at about 7 per cent. That is what the tax cuts of 1989 did. They broke the inflationary cycle in Australia for the first time in 20 years. They proved that we could go through a period of high growth and high demand without busting the wages system and without wages breaking out. That is what the effect was in 1988-89.

         What we are doing now with our tax cuts is again providing a climate which is conducive to reasonable and moderate wage settlements to keep the inflation rate down, whereas the tax cuts of the Opposition are paid in lieu of the GST. We have the same tax rates as you in that middle range from $20,000 to $40,000 with no 15 per cent GST. As a result, it will provide a much better wages climate for low inflation. In the maintenance of low inflation, which all of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          One Nation

         So the assertion of Senator Walsh, that rates will go back into high double digits, basically has no basis to it. How can it if the inflation rate remains low? Off an inflation rate of 3 per cent-odd, to go back to double digit interest rates, we would need real rates of interest of 8 or 9 per cent. There is no point and no reason why Australians should be burdened by such rates. Therefore, I see no basis to the argument. Even in 1989, when we paid tax cuts worth $6 billion, we still produced a surplus of $8 billion; it was the greatest surplus in our history; it was one of the only three or four surpluses produced by this Government in our history. So that is the principal fact.

         Senator Walsh's view of the world is essentially gloomy. It is that we should be producing surpluses forever. Let me make this point: if we produce surpluses for the next four or five years and we bring all of the Commonwealth Government securities back into Treasury—in other words, there are no Commonwealth securities on offer—what will the Commonwealth do with its surpluses? Will it start buying CBD towers in the capital cities? Will it start buying assets? What will it do with its surplus? Opposition members say that we should then sell them all, because the Opposition is into privatisation. The fact is that all of these things are exaggerations on the part of Senator Walsh and the Leader of the Opposition.

         The fact is that there is nothing wrong with handing back tax cuts of the variety that the Government intends, to produce a climate to keep the inflation rate low and, with it, lower interest rates. The only way Australia will get lower interest rates is with a low, underlying inflation rate. We have proven that we are the only party in national politics which can produce low inflation and keep it there.

         —In response to the honourable member for Capricornia, I can say that I am aware of such a proposal and that the Government does not intend to apply it. This, of course, stems from the Fightback proposal of the Opposition. As honourable members are aware, the Opposition is proposing to introduce a GST with an inflation impact of something in the order of 5 per cent with no consequential adjustment of money wages. It is proposing a compensation package through income tax cuts and increased allowances, which it claims will more than fully compensate all sections of the community.

         It also claims that other economic benefits, including two million jobs by the year 2000, would apply. In all of that, the real wage reduction is a crucial assumption—although I must say that in relation to the two million jobs the GST was not modelled; it is essentially irrelevant—of the Opposition that there would not be an ongoing inflation impact which would have severely adverse economic consequences.

In that case, why is it that the acoustical problem only goes one way and the honourable member now being voted on cannot get the benefit of the doubt for not having heard, too?

         —I was attempting to say that, in the context of the introduction of a goods and services tax, the assumption of a reduction in real wages is a quite crucial one. But subsequent studies have shown that, if this assumption does not hold—that is, if money wages move up with the increased inflation—then the economic outcomes will be quite disastrous.

         One such study was conducted by the same Dr Murphy who modelled scenario C. He showed that if wage increases were obtained to compensate for the inflationary effects of the GST then GDP would be 4 per cent lower in five years time than it would be otherwise. In making that calculation, he was using only part of the package—that is, a 3 per cent inflation impact not the more like 5 per cent figure. If he had included the rest of the package, obviously he would have had an even greater fall in GDP.

         Furthermore, as the Treasurer pointed out yesterday, the study by Dr Michael Porter and Andrew Chisholm shows that if real wages are maintained in the face of the inflation stemming from a GST, then GDP actually declines. So the wage behaviour in the context of a GST is clearly quite crucial to the economic outcome.

         But it is most unlikely that the wage and salary earners will act benignly in the face of a large inflationary surge stemming from the GST and just accept reduced real wages. Firstly, this is because the compensation package is far from adequate. We have already shown, through the Treasury analysis of the distributional effects of the GST, that something like 70 to 80 per cent of wage and salary earners would be worse off under the package. In those circumstances, they would not sit by and idly cop it sweet; they would take strong action for compensating wage increases.

         Secondly, the ACTU, which has some say in wages policy in this country in deciding how unions pursue their claims, has said that following the release of the Opposition package there would be further wage claims. I quote from the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         of 25 November last year, in which Mr Kelty said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . unions would continue to base their wage claims on the movement in the Consumer Price Index seeking wage rises to maintain workers' real living standards and compensate for the effect of the GST on prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite clear that the union movement, in its first look at this, was concerned to make sure that real wages were maintained and it would adjust wage claims according to the GST effect on prices. What it has seen since, from the distributional analysis, would not have changed that view very much, if at all.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Thirdly, the Opposition parties would have no mechanism for restraining any wage claims other than to contract the economy further by severely tightening monetary policy. Of course, if it did that we would have more economic contraction and higher unemployment.

         Fourthly, complete deregulation of the labour market, which of course is the thing that those opposite hold up as some sort of saviour, would do absolutely nothing in these circumstances to restrain wage claims. If there is complete deregulation, what is to stop people making wage claims to catch up for the inflation impost of the GST. You have no accord and there would be no trade union agreement, as there is at present, to keep wage increases to a level which would give us a price outcome comparable to that of our major trading partners, or less. All that would be lost with the GST.

         There is no reason at all to believe the Opposition assumption that there would be a reduction in real wages; that there would simply be an acceptance in the context of the GST by those who make wage claims and that they would not pursue higher wage claims. In those circumstances, the effects on GDP and unemployment would be quite disastrous.

         However, there is one impact that would certainly come from this proposal, and that is industrial disputation. With the additional wage claims would undoubtedly come some resistance from employers. We would be back to the old system of high levels of industrial disputation. The 60 per cent reduction in industrial disputes under this Government would be a thing of the past. In other words, under your package,

What it did contain, obviously, was a disproportionate range of products such as pet foods and household cleaners. According to the National Food Authority what would be required as `top ups' by the Opposition would amount to an extra 13 loaves of bread, 21 litres of milk, bananas, grapes, oranges, sweet corn, pumpkin, zucchini, pears, sausages, a bit of steak, some chops, some minced steak, some fish fingers, pork chops and about 15 other items—30 additional items, `top ups', before people could live a normal healthy life.

That is what you expect people to believe. You cannot have it both ways. Either the supermarket survey that you put forward to people as representative represents a genuine family shopping basket sufficient for the family's normal fortnightly food and household needs, or it does not. If it does represent those needs, according to you, then it imposes a dietary regime of Third World status on Australians, with only enough meat for one or two days per fortnight and serious health risks.

         —Members of the House may have noticed reports, citing the Real Estate Institute of Australia, that in the December quarter 1991 the national affordability ratio was at its best level since the March quarter 1988. The report confirmed the results of the Commonwealth Bank-Housing Industry Association index, which showed affordability at its highest level for over three years. These improvements in affordability result largely from cuts in official interest rates flowing through into substantial reductions in mortgage interest rates.

         The significant improvement in affordability has underpinned the recovery in the housing sector. That recovery is now very well established. Housing starts have risen for three consecutive quarters and are at their highest levels since September 1989. The major contributor to this growth has been the private sector.

         Leading indicators create a picture of further growth in the March quarter 1992. Dwelling approvals for the three months to February are up 3.7 per cent, despite the fall of 7.4 per cent for February reported today. The fall in February was due to a sharp decline in public and other private approvals after very strong growth in the preceding two months. Private houses, which represent around three-quarters of the total approvals, rose by 4.7 per cent. That is consistent with the Government strategy, which was to bring forward public sector approvals and commencements in the course of last year when the recession was very strong, and that allows us now, as private sector approvals are getting much stronger, to begin the process of winding back the contribution being made by the public sector.

         Reports from builders and lenders also add to our confidence in the upward trend in the housing sector. A. V. Jennings, Australia's largest home builder, claimed a sales record in February 1992, beating its previous high of two years ago by 10 per cent. The Commonwealth Bank and the New South Wales based St George Building Society have reported increases of over 60 per cent in home lending in the first two months of this year. The HIA latest survey of volume builders shows that new house sales rose by 15 per cent in February. All the factors, then, are in place for the recovery to continue.

         The impact of the cut in official interest rates in January 1992 is yet to be fully reflected in housing demand. The conditions are there for a restoration of confidence. Indeed, the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian
         </emphasis>
         newspaper on 17 March reported that lending institutions said that affordability had restored consumer confidence. The Real Estate Institute reports that there was a marked improvement in confidence and outlook during February amongst buyers and vendors. The Institute noted that first time home buyers activity in Melbourne was at its highest level on record.

         At this stage the recovery is simply a matter of confidence. The evidence is there that the recovery is under way. As that recovery grows we can expect, as the Master Builders Association indicated today, that we will achieve the target of the Indicative Planning Council of 137,000 starts this year. Against that situation, all we hear from the Opposition is whingeing, whining, negativism, and talking down any sign of recovery—in fact, talking down the industry. The problem of those opposite is that, rather than seeking the good, rather than seeing what is best for the Australian people, rather than contributing to the growth of confidence and stability of the housing industry, all we get is a negative approach, an approach which is about the Jeremiahs rather than about seeing the strong recovery that is occurring and is so important for new home buyers who are now, I am pleased to say, strongly back and present within the housing industry.

         That this House censures the Prime Minister for consistently misleading the Australian people about Australia's economic circumstances, and his economic policies, as exposed by the former Finance Minister, Senator Walsh.

        In the past several days in this Parliament and elsewhere, we have had a succession of examples of how this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will say or do anything for short term political gain. He will deliberately set out to misrepresent the circumstances to satisfy his particular needs at any point in time, irrespective of the consequences of those statements or those actions for the people of Australia.

         We saw it most recently last week in his backdown on the protection position that we understood his Government had supported for a large part of the latter half of the 1980s. Of course, today we have clear evidence from one of the ex-senior members of this Government, the ex-Finance Minister, Senator Walsh, in an interview reported in an Australian magazine which clearly demonstrates the extent to which on many occasions this particular Prime Minister has deliberately sought to misrepresent the situation.

         I guess the Prime Minister is in the tradition of Australian Labor Party leaders, as was summarised by Senator Richardson last year—when the Kirribilli conspiracy was exposed—when on Sydney radio he said that Mr Hawke had been justified in breaking his promise because it helped keep the Liberals out of power:

         The second area that we can take out of this statement by Senator Walsh today which demonstrates the extent to which this Prime Minister will go to misrepresent the circumstances relates to his continuing assessments of the shape of the economy. We have seen many examples of how he has deliberately misrepresented our economic circumstances for his own political ends. Remember how many times he denied that there would be a recession before the last election campaign. He kept denying it and he kept denying it, and then finally, of course, it became apparent in the data that there was a recession. Then, of course, it was a recession we `had to have'.

         Senator Walsh has given us a number of other examples of this sort of deliberate deception on the part of this Prime Minister. One of the most telling examples relates to the period in 1986 to which Senator Walsh is referring, when in relation to the conduct of fiscal policy he says:

         Keating has argued publicly that we ran a tight fiscal policy throughout the 1980s because the private economy was going along well and there was no need for compensatory government spending. . . The historical truth, of course, is that we started tightening fiscal policy seriously in 1986—

That is a classic example of where Senator Walsh has clearly exposed the extent to which in 1985-86 this man deliberately went out to mislead Australians in the course—

         A third example of the Prime Minister's deception and misrepresentation has to do with the recession itself and the reason we had a recession. Senator Walsh goes to great lengths to explain precisely how the excessive reliance on monetary policy was the principal reason we had a recession.

         —I do not care how I speak. I will get the point across. I could talk about the gross malaise of the epoch, but I would not be prepared to pick on the way you speak. How we speak is irrelevant. The substance of the point is that the Prime Minister has gone out of his way to blame everybody else but himself for this recession. There are some telling examples that we can take from the past. On 5 February 1991, the Prime Minister said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The performance of the Victorian economy is, I think, basically the cause of why we saw these negative growths in GDP, why we have the word recession in our newspapers.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 5 February 1991, it was Victoria's fault. On 8 February 1991, the Prime Minister said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Victoria is not to `blame' for the recession. Nor is the recession Victoria's `fault'. The Government did not want a recession, it wanted a slowdown.
       </para>
       <para>
        These examples show that, within just a few days of each other, he has completely changed his explanation of what has happened. It is little wonder that in an article in March 1991, Peter Smark pointed out, very accurately:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Paul Keating has blamed the Fraser Government, entrepreneurs, the banks and a cast of thousands for causing the recession. This week he added real estate agents and the Wool Corporation, and reached back through 25 years of pre-1983 governments in his relentless hunt for the culprits.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is an example of the extent to which there are now so many explanations on the record; yet only one explanation is right—the one that Senator Walsh gives as to why there is a recession: the excessive reliance on monetary policy. Senator Walsh said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the `recession we had to have' was in fact the recession we didn't have to have. The recession is a function of the over-reliance on monetary policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        He spells out why that process could have been avoided. This man, deliberately and knowingly misleading the people of Australia, stuck to his high interest rate policy way beyond the point he was advised to do so, pitched this economy into  recession, threw one million Australians out of work and inflicted the worst pain and hardship on average Australians since the 1930s.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Similarly, we can go to some specific issues. We had another example in the Parliament today of where this Prime Minister has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented the circumstances. One example of classic leadership weakness is Coronation Hill. If ever there was a mine or project that had been cleared on every conceivable ground and should have gone ahead, it was that project.

In Question Time today he referred to the fact that he put his position on the record in 1991—on television, I think he said in his answer—that he supported it but, of course, he lost the job of Treasurer and could not carry it through. If we look at the

        The Government considered all the issues, including the Aboriginal heritage issues, and decided against it.
       </para>
       <para>
        He gave his imprimatur to that position in relation to Coronation Hill. As we read Senator Walsh's document we find the true reason for the position that has been taken by this man on Coronation Hill. He stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The only way in which I can account for the Coronation Hill decision, or non-decision if you like, is that he—

       <para>
        that is, the Prime Minister—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        gave an undertaking to some caucus members in return for leadership votes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that it is one stage worse than that. The Prime Minister did deals with Caucus members for votes, but he did that on both sides of the issue. He told some members, in order to get their votes, that he would not let it go ahead; he told some members, such as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), that he would let it go ahead. On 23 December the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, there is another part to the deal of that particular honourable member. He is looking for the cuts in immigration, and they have not come yet either. What does the Prime Minister say when he is asked about deals? On 21 January 1992 on the John Laws program again, where all the major policy statements in this country are made—I will have to be careful because, if I keep saying John Laws, every other radio announcer in the country will get into me for giving him a free advertisement, but this man has made a lot of major statements on John Laws—he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I do not do any deals with anybody—
       </para>
       <para>
        you can just imagine him saying this—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I mean you make alliances, friendships and things, but they are not deals. Deals go to people getting positions and policies and what have you.
       </para>
       <para>
        Half of the Party of the Prime Minister was told of the policy of no mining at Coronation Hill, and the other half of his Party was told of the other policy of definitely letting mining at Coronation Hill go ahead. The only person who benefited from those deals was the Prime Minister. One job was saved—his job. He got the top job, and we lost about 630 jobs in Coronation Hill because that project did not go ahead. That is indicative of the type of person that this man is. He will take any one of those circumstances or issues and he will say or do anything; he will deal with anyone; he will even deal with his colleagues on both sides of the issue to get what he wants, irrespective of the consequences for the average Australian. Another example in this document from Senator Walsh today is a very important one which is to do with the Accord. Senator Walsh refers to that fact in his assessment. He stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We ran a pretty permissive wages policy through the 1980s. True, we didn't have a wages explosion. . . but year after year, the government said it was all right to have nominal wage increases of 7 per cent. Given that there was minimal productivity growth and that wages drift guaranteed an inflation rate of the same level, the drift of government policy was against the advice of the economic rationalists, people like me and the Treasury and Finance economists.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a clear-cut, damning statement of the wages policy that the Prime Minister has boasted about and misrepresented for the course of the whole of the 1980s. Indeed, we can just go to his One Nation statement and pick up some of the doozeys. Page 44 states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Accord between the Government and the ACTU has delivered unprecedented wage restraint since 1983. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        It is repeated again on page 13 of that statement:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . unprecedented wage restraint.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is, as Senator Walsh correctly said in endorsing the arguments that we have put for years, that you ran a pretty permissive wages policy—and why? Because you were locked into a deal with the ACTU on wages and you were forced to deliver, irrespective of the consequences for the worker—their real wages fell in the end because you did not control inflation—and irrespective of the consequences for Australia, because we lost any hope of being internationally competitive when our wage increases and nominal unit labour costs were roughly double those of our trading partners right through your time as Treasurer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         A final area that we can pick out—and a very politically sensitive area that Senator Walsh dwells on—is the issue of the tax cuts that have been promised. Separate to the issue that they are unfunded and that their delivery has not been not based on any figuring by Treasury, Senator Walsh goes out of his way to warn us that we are about to see the same mistakes made that were made in 1989. He said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If the new tax scales are to be taken seriously, they show we've learned nothing from 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        He goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        But if it is going to be taken seriously, that's a formula for very largely repeating the mistakes of 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        He is arguing here that the Government should not have delivered the 1989 tax cuts. It did not need to deliver them to get inflation down because the Prime Minister just pitched the economy into the deepest recession in 60 years. Inflation was going to fall like a stone anyway, but he delivered them because he had done a deal with the ACTU.

       <para first-indent="16">

         We go back to that statement I made about `no deals'. He does not do deals with anybody because deals imply that somebody gets privileged access to government; somebody gets a privileged position in government. This is a man of privilege looking after a few key mates such as union leaders and a couple of backbenchers whose support he needs in relation to Coronation Hill. Hang the consequences for the average Australian! You could not care less.

         Senator Walsh is very revealing because he goes on and criticises this Prime Minister in two other respects in relation to tax. Firstly, he says that in essence these proposals are, in effect, a flat tax. Just to show this man's view of flat tax in the past, before he came to having to try to buy his way back into government, I remind the House that when he criticised us when we talked about imposing a flat tax, or a flatter tax system, and using a consumption tax, he said that that would blow our society to pieces. You are not going to blow our society to pieces? Of course, the argument does not matter; the circumstances are what matter. He needed a point against us, so he used it. He said, `If you would believe that it would not blow our society apart, then you are more naive than I thought'.

        The point is very simple. This man has a record of blatant dishonesty, irrespective of the consequences for the average Australian. The pain and hardship in Wills and all over Australia today is the direct result of blatant misrepresentation by this man: manipulation of events, manipulation of circumstances, manipulation of arguments—manipulation of almost anything to save his political skin at the expense of every other person in Australia. It is a national disgrace that this man has got to the position he has attained, and he will prove to be the most dangerous Prime Minister we have ever seen in this country.

         —The device of the censure motion has been used more by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in this session of Parliament than in the last decade in this chamber. The standing order has been abused and such a motion now has no status in terms of prioritising issues or of requiring the Government to answer a case. The device is now being used simply like a matter of public importance. We see censure motions moved during Question Time or immediately after Question Time. They are moved willy-nilly—whatever takes the Leader of the Opposition's fancy. Not only that, they are simply a device to bring forth the vitriol that I am `blatantly dishonest' or `it is indicative of the type of person this man is'—all of this highly personal invective which the Leader of the Opposition specialises in.

The fact of the matter is that the principal forecast upon which the Leader of the Opposition relies and in respect of which he has pamphletted the whole nation by distributing five million or six million of these porkies into every letter box in the country is two million more jobs. He admits that it was only a judgment and he has the hide to query the official forecast of the Treasury, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Reserve Bank, the Department of Finance and, from the Prime Minister's office, Dr Rick Symes, formerly the Treasury's chief econometrician. After all, the statement was a statement by the Prime Minister, compiled in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, not in the Treasury. It is not a budget; it does not purport to be a budget. It explained more than adequately the forecasting framework. This is dragged into disrepute by the Leader of the Opposition, and Senator Walsh. Shame on him for doing it.

         —It is just massive dishonesty on your part to be doing this sort of thing. He then goes on to talk about how Senator Walsh has argued about how we run fiscal policy and a flat tax. Understand this about Senator Walsh: he believes in 60 per cent marginal tax rates. He opposed me when I cut the rates to 49 per cent in 1986. He wanted the top personal rate left at 60 per cent, with relatively low thresholds. If you are endorsing high marginal rates of tax at those rates, say so. But do not quote Senator Walsh attacking me for reducing the tax rates of Australians. Senator Walsh will attack anybody who reduces the tax rates of Australians because he is basically concerned with a high nominally progressive tax scale—not effectively progressive, but nominally progressive. The fact that people do not pay it and did not pay it always escaped him. Nobody paid the 60 per cent rate other than PAYE taxpayers. We made the system more effectively progressive by removing the free lunches, the credit cards, and cars, and imposing capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. We made the system more effectively progressive, and I do not apologise to anybody for it. I do not think the social compact ought to apply with penal rates of tax as we see in some of these countries which are often lauded by people—countries such as Sweden with 80 per cent and 90 per cent marginal tax rates. Who would want to live in a country where 80 per cent or 90 per cent

         So we made the clear, distinct and philosophical point that the rate was 49 per cent—it was just under half and the state did not collect more than half. Senator Walsh always objected to that and his objections were dismissed by the Government. He is still running that argument today. In your silliness, you want to quote him. What do you want to do? After all, they were your rates, pal—60 per cent. I had to bring them down. But here is your former adviser wanting to go back to them and quoting Senator Walsh about high marginal tax rates.

         The Leader of the Opposition then goes on about the permissive wages policy through the 1980s and he quotes Senator Walsh on that. I remember distinctly having a conversation with Senator Walsh in 1989 when he was complaining about the tax cuts then. I said, `Okay Peter, wages will take off at 12 to 15 per cent in this quarter. What do you think we should do about it?'. He said, `Oh, I don't know, but we shouldn't pay the tax cuts'. I said, `Yes, but that blows the whole inflation rate to pieces'. He said, `Oh well, that's the unions; they've got to pull their head in'. The fact is that it would not have happened. The market would have driven us to double digit inflation.

The fact is we are sitting here today with a 1 1/2 per cent inflation rate—game, set and match. The fact is that wages did hold in the recession. He calls a wages outcome of 6 to 7 per cent in a boom when inflation was running at 7 to 7.5 per cent—that is, travelling at the inflation rate or just below it—permissive. What does Senator Walsh require of us—further massive real wage cuts in a boom? Really! And you want to go and quote it.

         Senator Walsh says that the tax cuts are a mistake. That is his view; he is entitled to a view. But I do not believe that handing back the incidence of inflation on the tax system is a mistake; it is not a mistake.

         As far as Coronation Hill is concerned, I was asked a question about this by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). I will make these points about it. The value of the gold production over the life of the Coronation Hill mine is only about $285m—that is, if you do not rehabilitate the mine. That is not profits; that is the value of the production. The mine was estimated to have a net present value of $82m. If it had to be rehabilitated—as it would have to be, given its position on the South Alligator River—how much of that net present value of $82m would be left upon that rehabilitation?

         I just heard the Leader of the Opposition interjecting that I did deals on both sides. I made my position clear about Coronation Hill in June 1991. That is how I would have voted when the matter came to Cabinet; I would have voted for an arrangement to be made between the Aboriginal community and the mining company to work it out. Cabinet, in its wisdom, decided otherwise. The Labor Government decided otherwise. A decision was made and, as far as I am concerned, the decision should stand. It is as simple as that.

         The fact is that at the heart of this censure motion is a very simple issue—the issue of credibility. Senator Walsh is not sitting on this side of the Parliament. Senator Walsh is not a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party. Senator Walsh has been one of your supporters. He is not one of the enemies of the Prime Minister and honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating); he is one of the people who, with the Prime Minister, had blood on his hands when they deposed Bob Hawke to put this Prime Minister into the Lodge at the end of last year. He is one of the people who voted for the honourable member for Blaxland. He and his criticisms deserve and form the basis of this censure motion which goes to the credibility of the Prime Minister.

         Let me run through the 10 points which form the basis of Senator Walsh's remarks. Firstly, he just explodes as a myth this claim that the relationship between the Labor Government and the trade union movement and the resulting accord have been of benefit to this country. The truth of the matter is that at the heart of many of our economic problems has been Labor's accord with the trade union movement. Here you have got it in black and white. Senator Walsh stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        True, we didn't have a wages explosion like 1981-82 or 1974-75, but year after year, the government said it was alright to have nominal wage increases of 7%. Given that there was minimal productivity growth and that wages drift guaranteed an inflation rate of the same level, the drift of government policy was against the advice of the economic rationalists, people like me and the Treasury and Finance economists.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, that policy, contrary to what those opposite have been saying, has been an absolute and dismal failure; that is point one.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Point two is that the way in which the Government put together its numbers in its recent bit of catch-up politics, the One Nation statement, was very revealing. We have been saying publicly that the numbers are shonky. Today we have proof from Senator Walsh who says, for instance:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the table in the recent Economic Statement which shows the budget coming back into surplus is definitely not a Treasury table.
       </para>
       <para>
        Game, set and match! And the Prime Minister confirmed it in what he said following Question Time in response to the censure. The truth is that these numbers are just being cooked up so that the Government can go on and say anything and do anything to substantiate its case.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Point three is a classic. It is just a clear statement from Senator Walsh that when the Government said in 1986 that the private sector was going pretty well it in fact privately knew that we were headed towards a recession. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) showed in a quote that, when the Prime Minister, then as Treasurer, was asked, `Are we heading towards a recession?', he said, `We are not within cooee of it'. The interesting thing about Senator Walsh is that he has shown that the Government knew that statement was in fact false. It was in fact just a straight, bald faced lie. It is as clear as that.

         —Point four is a critical point again from Senator Walsh. First, we now know that some of the numbers the Government used were shonky, and that further substantiates our case that this whole pack—a house of cards if you like—constructed for the tax cuts, to substantiate the question of where the money is coming from, is not true. It is built on quicksand, paid for on my bankcard—that is, the One Nation statement—and you have got it here from Senator Walsh in black and white telling you so. I quote him exactly:

        If the new tax scales are to be taken seriously, they show we've learned nothing from 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the time since the `One Nation, One Job' statement has come down, we have had an absolute avalanche of independent commentators on the question of whether or not this scenario, these forecasts, was accurate. This week the National Australia Bank said:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         While this scenario may be a desirable objective, it is, in our view, unlikely to be met in the first half of the 1990s because of inherent sluggishness in the domestic economy, following the spending binge of the late 1980s.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes on to raise the question and its concerns about the fall off in economic activity in Japan and the state of the world economy. So the scenarios on the basis of the National Australia Bank are clearly overoptimistic with clearly shonky numbers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But it is more than that. Look at Richard Blandy in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Independent Monthly
         </emphasis>
         that came out today. He said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In effect, One Nation offers "blue-sky" tax cuts.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is not bad—blue sky tax cuts, basically plucked from thin air to make a case. The numbers are shonky, as Senator Walsh says. Professor Blandy then went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The "fistful of dollars", on this occasion, comes from One Nation, not Fightback.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is another endorsement of the critical point made by Senator Walsh—that there has been an avalanche. One can go to the Treasury's own document, which was released under the Freedom of Information Act, in respect of the coalition's Fightback package. When asked about the possibility of a 4 per cent growth rate—and remember the Government's projections are 4.75 and then an average of 4.5 per cent—Treasury said in respect of 4 per cent, `This would be a significant challenge'. That is a very nice Treasury subtle statement but, in other words, `You haven't got a ghost of a chance of making your forecast'. They are your numbers. Look at what the CAI says. It refers to the forecasts, et cetera as `the unrealistic nature of the forecasts', and it goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Statement is a product of what ought to be by now the discredited Keynesian formula for growth.

        I will not read all of the quotes, but they damn the statement from start to finish. One can then read what Ross Gittins said yesterday. He is not exactly a card carrying member of the Liberal Party, but I think he sums it up rather well. On the protection debate—but it has a broader meaning—he says:

        Syntech, professional economists advising on matters economic in Australia, say about the Government's forecasts:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government's own forecasts depict an external deficit that would leave us still at the bottom of the barrel in the international balance-of-payments ranking over the next five years. But, like too much of the rest of this obliging official framework,—

       <para>
        that is referring to the forecasts—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        the official external deficit projections are far too optimistic for the scenario they accompany.
       </para>
       <para>
        There could not be a more damning indictment of the basis upon which the Government has proceeded. Lastly, one can look at the responses of the business community to One Nation. Let us remember that this was a statement directed to kick-starting the economy and giving people a sense of confidence about the future so that we could overcome the appalling fall off in investment in recent years. The whole thing is built on assumptions that suddenly, as at 1 July, people are going to wake up that morning and reckon the recovery is going to be here and they are going to go out and invest. When a survey was done by
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         ABM
        </emphasis>
        magazine this year, people were asked:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Do you believe that the economic statement has created an environment to stimulate capital investment by your company in 1992-93?
       </para>
       <para>
        What were the responses? Seventy-nine per cent said no. Another question asked was this:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        How would you rate the chances of the initiatives creating 800,000 new jobs over four years?
       </para>
       <para>
        Given the choice between `Realistic' and `Unrealistic', 90 per cent said it was unrealistic. Then there was the question:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given the current international economic environment do you believe that sufficient initiatives have been taken to generate a growth forecast of 4.75% in 1992-93?
       </para>
       <para>
        The noes were 84 per cent. Lastly:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The economic statement combines capital works expenditure with tax and other concessions. Will the combined effect be sufficient to kickstart the economy?
       </para>
       <para>
        The noes made up 48 per cent and those undecided 37 per cent. So the whole thing is built on a pack of cards, built on quicksand, and is simply not going to happen. Senator Walsh's comments today finally blow away any pretence of credibility this Government has, based on its One Nation statement and its expectations for the future. But that is only point No. 4.

         Point No. 5 goes to tax scales and the design of Labor's One Nation tax scales. Honourable members will remember that ACOSS, again not card-carrying members of the Liberal Party, said that Labor's policy was regressive. It said it because half of Australia's taxpayers, those on the lowest incomes, those on less than $20,700, will not get one cent out of Labor's tax policy.

         Senator Walsh goes further, because he says that it is taking the tax system closer towards a flat tax. That really blows apart the credibility of the Government and of the Prime Minister particularly, because he has railed against flat taxes claiming that they are likely to blow society apart, yet here is Senator Walsh saying that that is the sort of tax policy introduced in One Nation.

         Point No. 6 goes back to what happened in 1989. Senator Walsh simply makes the point that in 1989 the Government should have cancelled the tax cuts that were then projected. Its failure to do so led to very high interest rates. There is a warning here for every Australian: high interest rates are on the way back again under the One Nation statement outlined by this Government.

         In point No. 7 Senator Walsh admits the importance of getting marginal tax rates down, and this is a critical point of the coalition's tax policy. Point No. 8, of course, blows away the Prime Minister's credibility on Coronation Hill. Point No. 9 talks about the Prime Minister's lack of honesty in dealing with the public.

         Lastly, in point No. 10, Senator Walsh admits that the person responsible for this recession is in fact the current Prime Minister, which is why he is entitled to be called Mr Recession. In conclusion,  this document pulls away the last vestiges of the Government's credibility. The Prime Minister deserves to be censured.

This is the journal which decided to carry an interview with Senator Walsh. This is Peter Alexander Walsh, not to be confused with Maximilian Walsh—although I must say that when one looks at their two views, one finds them reinforcing each other, one finds them becoming increasingly the dismal duo of economic commentary in Australia. One finds that both Maximilian and Peter Alexander are essentially talking each other into a defeatist view of Australia. One might call Senator Walsh Pessimistic Pete, because basically Walshie is a fellow of a pessimistic frame of mind.

         When Walshie was going around in increasingly diminishing concentric circles ploughing his paddocks in bloody Doodlakine, he was working out ways to vent his spleen on the Country Party, which then became the National Party of Australia. So Walshie's whole reason for living and his whole reason for being in politics is to oppose conservatism, and particularly that conservatism represented by the Country Party, now the National Party, and the modern-day Liberal Party. For a long time it has been very hard to get Walshie to feel up-beat about anything, even when the economy has been going well.

I might say that what intrigues me about this debate is that it is about Walshie's bucket on One Nation. What surprises me is how long it took for Walshie to produce it. A week before One Nation was produced, before it was released to the public, Walshie said to me, `If you jokers don't reverse the Coronation Hill decision, I am going to bucket the economic statement'. That was before he had even seen it. He had decided he would judge it on the basis of one issue alone, and that was whether we reversed the Coronation Hill statement.

But let us understand one thing about Walshie: he has never been able to avoid particular obsessions, and Coronation Hill is one of his obsessions. There are others I would just like to refer to. One might imagine for a moment why it was the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         It is basically an issue about the accord. The communists have never liked the accord, the Liberals have never liked the accord, and Walshie has never liked the accord. So there is this trifecta of the communists, or what is left of them, Walshie and the Liberals. They are united on one view and one view only: that the accord is no good. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) indicated, Walshie is entitled to that view.

A few years ago an accord was essential, not just for the Government, but for a Liberal government, and it was the absence of it that was the Achilles heel of the Fraser Government. One has to judge the Leader of the Opposition not just in terms of what he says today. We know that he will resort to anything in order to make a cheap political point. He will even rely on the organ of the Communist Party, or what is left of it, in order to substantiate his point.

         The point here is that Peter Walsh has always doubted whether the accord would work. Walshie surprises me in this regard. This morning when I told him over the phone what I was going to say about his view, I said, `Walshie, if we had not had those tax cuts of which you now so strenuously complain, of which you used to complain, we would not have had the wages outcome we have had, we would not have been able to contain wages during a period of very strong growth and we would not now be seeing underlying inflation rates of between 3 and 4 per cent'.

         Once Walshie gets a bone—his bone was the accord and the tax cuts that we provided—it takes a long time to wrestle it from the grip of his vice-like jaws. Walshie has been wrestling with this bone notwithstanding the fact that the record is in, the runs are on the board, if you like, and the accord has been a great success for all Australia. Australia has never lived through a period of such strong growth without also having a wages explosion feeding into inflation and then having to grind down the economy on the basis of trying to snuff out the inflation induced by the wages growth. This is Walshie's view. Therefore, the Opposition has to be terribly careful about the way in which it decides to invoke Senator Walsh in support of its argument, regardless of the nature of the publication which decides to carry his views.

         I want to make another point. The Leader of the Opposition started off by saying that the figures of which Peter Walsh complains do not come from a Treasury table. This is breathtaking. In the past month in here we have been hearing the Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy blackguarding the Treasury, taking to bits the Treasury documents, saying that they are not worth the paper they are printed on; that they are produced by some group of propagandists in the Treasury building; that they cannot be relied on;  that they do not tell the truth.

         Yet, on the flimsiest of evidence, those opposite say that because Peter Walsh says that a table is not a Treasury table it is not to be believed;  in other words, that if it were a Treasury document they would believe it. If we could convince those opposite that it was a Treasury document, they would then say that they did not believe it because it had been put together by that group of propagandists in the Treasury.

         The point is that the Prime Minister has indicated that the Treasury puts together the forecast for the year out—the year immediately ahead—the Budget Papers for the year immediately ahead and the Forward Estimates of outlays only for a few years ahead. The Treasury does not, in the context of the normal budgetary process, put together years of forecasts for both sides of the Budget. But on this occasion we wanted to do that for the very good reason that we could demonstrate that, with the kind of growth that one can anticipate in Australia in the near future, we can provide a stimulus, get the Budget back to balance and at the same time deliver tax cuts that will produce a marginal rate of 30 per cent in that crucial area that has been focused on by the Opposition.

         In order to do that, as the Prime Minister said, a group of officials, chaired by a Treasury official and including other officials from the Treasury, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance and econometricians from my office and from the Prime Minister's office, was tasked with this job of putting together these estimates. That was the purpose of doing it.

         We have to take with handfuls of salt this new-found enthusiasm for Treasury authenticity on the part of the Opposition when it has for the past four weeks been misrepresenting the Treasury, quoting its documents out of context and abusing the authors of the documents on every occasion. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did it once again. He quoted from a document and said that the Treasury had said that something would be a significant challenge, given that OECD growth averaged only 3 per cent in the 1980s. He was talking about the prospect of growing at 4 per cent during the years ahead.

         The document that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was quoting from was not a commentary on us; it was a commentary on him, a commentary on Fightback. What the Treasury said was that a significant challenge was producing growth rates of that order after the introduction of a tax change, after all the inflationary consequences of that and after the interest rate hike necessary to snuff the inflationary consequences of Fightback out of the system. Treasury was saying that under the Opposition we could not grow because of its wrong-headed policies, policies which are about high inflation, not low inflation;  about no growth, not growth;  about no employment, not strong employment growth of the kind that we are talking about. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, out of his own mouth, has condemned his own proposition by relying on Treasury documents which were a criticism of his proposals, not ours.

         This debate has been a bit of a joke in the sense that it has been all about what a Labor senator, a former Minister, has had to say about some of his own obsessions, gathered up over the years, from which he has never been able to relent. But he has more contemporary views, particularly about the Opposition. I just remind the Opposition what Senator Walsh had to say. The Prime Minister quoted him. He said that he has always opposed the idea of a GST type tax. He opposes it now, at the very least because its transition costs are high and because of the consequences for a big boost to the CPI and the way in which the Opposition would deal with that, by producing a credit squeeze and, therefore, a long term recession in this country. Those opposite can derive no comfort from the point of view of Senator Walsh on practically any issue. He is an enemy of the Liberal Party and, most particularly, an enemy of its economic policies, especially those relating to consumption taxes. I move:

These statistics provide a graphic insight into the lives of Aboriginal people and should be again placed on the public record. Of the 99 who died between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 1989:

        Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are over-represented in custody at a rate—calculated nationally—of 29 times that of the general community. In some States the rate is considerably higher and has escalated during the very time of the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission found this grossly unacceptable, as does every fair-minded Australian and I believe every political party represented in this Parliament.

         Mr Speaker, the documents I have tabled show that governments have overwhelmingly supported the recommendations of the Royal Commission. Governments must be held to the undertakings detailed in their responses. This necessarily involves the creation of mechanisms for monitoring implementation. The Royal Commission emphasised effective monitoring arrangements. Indeed, they are the subject of its very first recommendation. The Commonwealth will fund ATSIC to carry out this monitoring role, in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and to coordinate Commonwealth monitoring arrangements and consultation with State and Territory governments.

         In addition to the social justice objective I have already referred to, the process of reconciliation has two other important objectives which seek to keep faith absolutely with Aboriginal aspirations. First, the process seeks to promote an understanding by all Australians of the history, cultures, past dispossession and continuing disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and of the need to redress that disadvantage. Second, as a part of the reconciliation process the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will consult with Aboriginal people and the wider community on whether the process of reconciliation would be advanced by a formal document or documents and to make recommendations on the nature and content of any such document.

         The Council has emphasised that this consultation process must not be rushed and that there are many important issues to be worked through with both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. While the name of any document has yet to be determined there are far more complex and substantive issues to be addressed. The results of recent public opinion polls show that a very large majority of Australians support a document as one of the outcomes of the reconciliation process. The unanimous support of the Commonwealth Parliament for the process and now the support of State and Territory governments gives us time, as someone else said in December, to address these important public policy issues for our nation.

         —by leave—Mr Deputy Speaker, the first report I have just tabled relates to the proposed redevelopment by the CSIRO of its facilities at North Ryde, New South Wales. The main elements of the proposal are: a rationalisation and consolidation of the CSIRO accommodation at North Ryde; a progressive release of approximately 15.8 hectares of identified surplus land and up to 11 development lots to create a science and technology park; the retention of principal CSIRO buildings in good condition; and the provision for all of CSIRO's anticipated accommodation needs for the foreseeable future in existing buildings, upgraded as necessary, and state-of-the-art new buildings. The estimated out-turn cost of the work is $98m, to be funded from the sale and/or lease of surplus land at North Ryde.

         The Committee found that the standard of facilities at North Ryde restricts the continuing development of industrially significant research initiatives with a high national priority for the biotechnology, mining and minerals, energy exploration and food industries as well as work of major environmental significance. Each of the divisions at North Ryde plays a major role in providing research vital to its industry sector. These sectors represent major components of the Australian economy and include: coal, with exports of $6 billion; minerals, with exports of $16 billion; manufactured goods, with exports of $17 billion; and pharmaceutical and diagnostic products, currently imported at a cost of $3 billion.

         In recommending that the proposal proceed, the Committee has concluded that the development of a prestige science and technology park by the CSIRO at North Ryde is the most cost effective method available to it of providing the funds necessary for the development of high quality research facilities. As the proposal has been referred at a very advanced conceptual stage, the Committee has recommended that CSIRO provide it with detailed plans of each aspect of the proposal prior to the commencement of construction.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Mr Deputy Speaker, there is one aspect of the proposal which the Committee believes should not remain at North Ryde but should be relocated to the Riverina region of New South Wales. I refer to the food research laboratory of the Division of Food Processing. The Committee believes that the food research laboratory can operate efficiently from the Riverina region as it has good transport links and an existing scientific base on which CSIRO could build. At the same time it would provide a stimulus to the scientific and industrial sectors in an important food growing and processing area.

         The Committee strongly disagrees with the working party set up to examine the future structure of the Division of Food Processing which rejected non-capital locations, with the professional needs of scientists being an overriding criteria. The Committee believes that CSIRO should be taking a national view when it examines such issues. In this situation it has a perfect opportunity to assist regional development, allow closer interaction with both food producers and processors and provide opportunities for contact with other scientists working in these industries.

         Having considered the evidence presented by CSIRO and from the Riverina region, and taking into account the views of the sectional committee which visited the area, the Committee has recommended that the food research laboratory be transferred to the Riverina region and that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) do all within his power to ensure that that transfer takes place. The Committee has not recommended a particular site, although the sectional committee did inspect a number of sites adjacent to the Charles Sturt University at Wagga Wagga. The Committee believes that the question of a particular site should be a matter for discussion between the CSIRO and the relevant authorities in the Riverina region.

         The second report which I have tabled deals with the proposed construction of a new permanent repository for the Australian Archives at East Burwood, Victoria. This new building will provide up-to-date, climate controlled storage facilities for permanent value Commonwealth records in the custody of Archives in Victoria. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $6.5m at October 1991 prices. The Committee has recommended the construction of the proposed repository.

         At present, permanent value Commonwealth records are stored in a former dry-cleaning factory in the suburb of Brighton. The Committee concluded, after inspecting the Brighton repository, that, if permanent value Commonwealth records remain stored there, many irreplaceable records will be lost. In fact, some have already been lost and others severely damaged. There is, therefore, an urgent need for Archives to be provided with a modern facility in which to store permanent value records in Victoria. Constructing a new repository at the existing site was considered impractical.

         After an exhaustive site selection process for a new site, Archives settled on a site at East Burwood for the new repository. The site is eminently suited, being in a designated technology park and not excessively distant from Melbourne's central business district. A larger site could have been purchased but more distant from the main users of archival materials. The building itself will provide office accommodation, an area for conservation and a large storage area. The storage area will be on three levels. It will have a curved roof to accelerate water run off, an essential requirement for buildings of this type.

         Although the design is somewhat austere, it nevertheless reflects a need for functionality and a need for the building to be constructed of materials reflecting some cost-consciousness. The Committee questioned Archives about the ability of the building to be expanded. Archives advised the Committee that once all permanent value records are transferred to the new building, the building will have adequate capacity for another 10 to 12 years growth. If by then there is a need to expand further, the site is large enough for extensions to the building to be provided. These extensions will provide additional storage area for another 10 to 12 years. The building will be provided with a number of special features, including strengthened floors, special air-conditioning and fire protection measures. The need for these features was justified.

Construction of the third runway was exempted from the scrutiny of the Committee, on the grounds of urgency, by the House on 14 November 1991—and we had something to say about that.

         The international terminal building was opened in 1970 and met all the then relevant codes. Airport terminal buildings are not expressly covered by codes, but they need to have adequate protection. A number of fire hazard reports have recommended the installation of fire sprinklers to provide safety for the occupants of the building and to protect the property. Other improvements to provide smoke isolation, an emergency evacuation system and additional fire exits were recommended.

         Since the Federal Airports Corporation assumed responsibility for Sydney Airport on 1 January 1988, additional fire exits have been constructed as part of a project which entailed a number of improvements to the international terminal building.

         The Federal Airports Corporation has installed fire sprinklers in the international terminal complex at Sydney Airport, which is scheduled for commissioning in 1992. The design of this building was based on the assumption that the international terminal building would be upgraded by the provision of a sprinkler system so that a fire originating in the international terminal building would be contained within that building. The provision of a fire sprinkler system has been evaluated by the FAC as being necessary for the protection of the occupants and the building and to achieve Building Code of Australia compliance. The building is vast, and firefighting after detection has been evaluated as very difficult.

         While the Committee has recommended that the work proceed, there are a number of issues in the report on which I should comment. The continued absence of a master plan for Sydney Airport is a matter of serious concern. In fact, in 1988, in reporting on the construction of the international terminal complex, the Committee recommended that the FAC prepare a master plan as expeditiously as possible to ensure the overall orderly development and operation of the airport. While the FAC has appointed a consultant to finalise the master plan, the Committee has recommended that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins) direct the FAC to complete the master plan as a matter of extreme urgency.

         I should add that, in the absence of a master plan, the Committee is loath to recommend further work at Sydney Airport. In fact, it is my personal view that the Committee should not recommend any further work at Sydney Airport until a master plan is completed. However, as this project concerns an issue of public safety, the Committee has no option but to agree to the work proceeding.

         The Committee is concerned about the cost of the project—$14.6m—and has recommended that the FAC review all aspects of the proposal in order to determine areas of possible cost savings. In relation to cost, the Committee has also recommended that the FAC commission a fire safety study to determine whether savings can be made in the provision of fire sprinklers. Evidence was given to the Committee which indicated that savings may be possible by limiting sprinklers to areas where they are required for life safety reasons or as cost-effective fire protection. I thank the House.

         —by leave—In speaking to this motion concerning the installation of fire sprinklers in the international terminal building at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, I would like, first of all, to commend the Joint Committee on Public Works for its diligence. It is obvious that it has been very thorough in looking at this matter.

         I am very concerned, however, about some of the comments of the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). In particular, he mentioned that there is evidence that savings are to be made with the installation of these sprinklers. It seems that there are moves afoot to spend some $15m to upgrade the sprinkler system in the existing terminal. The Committee has now come forward with a recommendation that the work proceed, but has then added the caveat that there is evidence of some savings to be made. I feel that this is a matter of some concern and, frankly, it is a matter to which the Government ought to be made to respond and on which it should explain why those savings are not being examined further.

         I would like to follow up on a couple of other points from the report. One involves the question of disability allowances which may be sought while these sprinklers are being installed. I understand that one of the unions involved is seeking a disability allowance of some $50 a day. Again, this raises a lot of questions, such as: who would be bearing the cost? Is $50 disability allowance a day a reasonable claim? I think we should have some answers. Who will have to pay it? Will it be the Australian Customs Service or the Federal Airports Corporation?  I think that before the work is to proceed, not after it has commenced, we should receive some answers to these questions.

         After all, I think all honourable members have vivid memories of what happened with the construction of this Parliament House and how there were some enormous blow-outs in costs because some of the unions involved used their muscle during the construction to exploit the situation to their own financial benefit. In fact, many honourable members would recall that the Federal coalition parties highlighted in their rorts report some of the worst extremes that went on during the construction of this place. It really was little short of a national scandal.

         I also note the point that the Chairman made about the need for a master plan for Mascot Airport. It seems extraordinary that despite the fact that the Federal Airports Corporation did promise this as long ago as 1988—some four years ago—we still have not seen it done. I think the Committee is to be commended for having emphasised this point. The fact that the Chairman has had to say that he believes it is a matter of `extreme urgency' that such a master plan be developed, highlights the fact that insufficient supervision is being given to this whole matter by this current Government. I believe if the Government continues to ignore that recommendation by the Committee, then further questions should be raised.

         Obviously, this is a very important facility. We have a massive investment there. The Government's record to date has been one of some considerable embarrassment, not only to the Government but also to the nation, in the way the argument about the third runway has gone on and on—bearing in mind that the decision was taken as early as 1982 to build that third runway, but even today we still have not seen it built. I wonder whether this question of the master plan might be facing a similar delay.

         Really, when one thinks about it, there are very large sums of money involved here. If there is no master plan it is hard to believe that every decision taken will necessarily be in the long term interests of improving that facility. For that reason and for many others, it should be, as the Chairman has pointed out, a matter of urgency; it should have been done some years ago and, clearly, the FAC should be brought to task over it and made to respond by putting together a master plan thoroughly, responsibly and in a professional manner. I commend the Committee again. With those questions, to which I trust we will receive some responses in due course, I leave my remarks there.

         —by leave—At the outset, I wish to acknowledge my strong support for the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Public Works for the relocation of the food research laboratory to the Riverina region. The Committee Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), accompanied by the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman), the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), and the Secretary, Mr Peter Roberts, visited Wagga Wagga in January as part of the Committee's inquiry into the redevelopment of the CSIRO facilities at North Ryde in New South Wales.

         As part of that overall redevelopment, the proposal was put forward that the CSIRO's food research laboratory might be relocated, to its advantage, in a rural area. With the support of the Wagga Wagga City Council, the Riverina Regional Development Board has been central to the bid to have the CSIRO division relocated in Wagga Wagga or another Riverina centre. However, it was considered that Wagga Wagga would be the most appropriate because of a site being available adjacent to the Charles Sturt University-Riverina campus. Other factors in favour of Wagga Wagga are that it is the centre of one of Australia's richest agricultural areas and has a significant food processing industry.

         While in Wagga Wagga, the Committee took time to visit the university, where discussions took place with the Dean of the Faculty of Science and Agriculture, Professor Jim Pratley. The Committee also inspected the possible site for the Division of Food Processing as well as calling at the nearby Wagga Agriculture Research Institute. It also inspected the operations of Murrumbidgee Dairy Products together with the Murrumbidgee Flour Mill, which is a division of the Goodman Fielder group. There were also discussions with the Mayor of Wagga Wagga, Alderman Pat Brassil, and with representatives of the Riverina Regional Development Board.

         It was a comprehensive coverage and, as reported at the time, the Committee members were impressed with what Wagga Wagga had to offer. They saw distinct advantages in the city as an agricultural centre as well as having Charles Sturt University, the Agriculture Research Institute and viable food processing industries. The proximity of the Horticultural Research Centre and the CSIRO Water Resources Division at Griffith was another advantage.

         It is my view that the relocation of the CSIRO's Food Processing Division to a region with a strong agricultural industry makes sense because it offers real benefits to both the industry and the CSIRO. Such a move would strengthen the area's existing agricultural enterprises, provide for expansion and assist economic diversification.

         A major consideration in favour of the Riverina proposal for the siting of the division is the substantial cost savings with the initial design and construction as well as ongoing savings compared with other options. Construction times will also be considerably reduced. Another factor that needs to be taken into consideration by the Government and the CSIRO is that Wagga Wagga is ideally located in the centre of the Murray-Darling basin food bowl. Some 125 processing companies are currently in operation in the Riverina area, and there is a developing trend for metropolitan plants to relocate to rural food growing centres.

         Most large metropolitan companies are multinational with overseas ownership, and there is a need to strengthen support for new Australian owned rural based companies in the national interest. Communications with Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne universities and research centres are easily provided from Wagga Wagga. Experience at Charles Sturt University and other organisations indicated that the Wagga Wagga environment was very attractive to professional staff. The city also provided good opportunities for employment, education and sporting and other social activities for staff and families.

         The Minister has indicated that the decision on relocation will be made by the CSIRO Board and that he will have no say in it. I understand and I accept that bodies, particularly those that have statutory responsibilities, should, as far as practicable, be left to manage the instrumentalities for which they have been given responsibility, but I agree with the Committee and with what the Chairman of the Committee has said in this House this afternoon, that the Minister should do all within his power to ensure that the recommendation of the Committee to relocate the food research laboratory to the Riverina region is approved.

         It is also desirable that boards are made aware of owners' policies and objectives, and that is where the Minister comes in. That is what the Committee obviously had in mind when it said that the Minister should do all within his power to ensure that this recommendation is approved. The Minister must make sure that the policies and objectives of the owner—in this case, the Australian Government—are well known to the board. In this instance, I would have thought it perfectly reasonable for the Government to convey a view to the CSIRO Board that, provided there are no significant financial or operational disadvantages to the CSIRO, it should relocate its food research laboratory in an appropriate rural region.

         If the Government does not make such an assessment and advises the CSIRO of its view, then it must accept that it will be seen to be negligent in the discharge of its responsibilities to the taxpayers. Again, to borrow a phrase from the speech of the Chairman of the Committee, the Government itself should insist that the CSIRO take a national view. I have no doubt that the best long term benefits for the CSIRO would be achieved by relocating the Food Processing Division in the Wagga Wagga area.

I think most of what should be said has been said by the honourable member for Hume, except that—I do not know whether all members of this Parliament know this—the area being considered in the Riverina is probably one of the most prolific food producing areas in Australia, taking in the area around Wagga Wagga, up through Leeton, Griffith and Narrandera, and including the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area and the Coleambally Irrigation Area.

         There are a number of food processing plants in the area, particularly in Wagga Wagga and out towards the MIA and the CIA, and I think it would be a natural move for the Division of Food Processing at North Ryde to move into the Riverina region. The Charles Sturt University would ensure that there could be scientific assistance for the CSIRO in that area. Earlier this week the Federal Government announced that the natural gas pipeline would be extended into the Riverina region through Leeton, Griffith and Narrandera, and of course that will have a further effect on the food processing industry in those areas.

I think that area has tremendous potential as it is right in the midst of what I believe to be the major food processing area of Australia.

         —In speaking to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, I wish to say that, since coming to office in March 1983, the Hawke and Keating governments have undertaken the most comprehensive overhaul of Australia's defence structure since Federation, commencing with the Dibb report in March 1987 through to June 1990 with

Now that the macro aspects of the defence question have been dealt with, the Government has turned its attention to both modernising particular aspects of defence law and tidying up the administrative quirks which have survived in legislation over the years.

         Yet, as honourable members would be well aware, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is far more than a housekeeping Bill because of the changes it proposes to the existing conscription laws. By any reckoning, conscription is an emotive subject in Australia as it has always been since an earlier Prime Minister, Mr Billy Hughes, first brought the issue to prominence in 1916. Certainly the publicity that has been generated in the media since the Government's intentions became known would support such a contention.

         To my way of thinking it is easy to accept that a diversity of opinion would exist in the community regarding conscription. After all, we are dealing with a matter that, in common with a host of social issues, deals with the difficult question of an appropriate balance between the rights of an individual and our collective responsibility to our society.

         I believe that, within its proposed plans to amend part IV of the Defence Act 1903, the Government has come up with a treatment of the issue of conscription which is both practical for the times we live in and yet responsive to any contingency which may arise. The measures are specifically that, firstly, there must be prior parliamentary approval for conscription; secondly, conscientious objection to particular wars, as well as to wars generally, would be allowed; thirdly, the expression `conscientious belief' would be defined; fourthly, there would be the provision of tribunals to consider claims of conscientious belief and for appeals from those tribunals; fifthly, there would be the removal of the current discriminatory provisions; and, lastly, there would be a call-up in the order of classes prescribed by the regulations.

         I have noted the words of Opposition spokespeople and the wider opinion expressed in the press and on radio talkback shows that there is no real disagreement with the general thrust of the Government's plans. Frankly, it would be hard to believe that anybody could support a case for the introduction of conscription without parliamentary approval as the present legislation allows. Obviously in 1992 it is entirely inappropriate to have a law which forces the Parliament into the picture only after the publication of a conscription proclamation.

         Likewise, it would be hard to believe that anyone would wish to see a continuation of the present judicial system proceedings which confront an individual claiming conscientious objection. How well many of us remember some of the distasteful cases which were battled out in the courts some years ago where, under the adversarial system, people were forced to answer horrific questions on what they would or would not do if confronted by acts of violence against their loved ones. Individuals were virtually forced to admit to cowardice or moral perversity to have their conscientious objection accepted.

         Unfortunately, the adversarial system left little room for the acceptance of a point of view which was different from the mainstream or the possibility that a person could hold a strong moral conviction against a given war and yet not be a coward, intellectually disabled or a liar. It is the Government's intention to replace those judicial style proceedings with conscientious objection tribunals which would operate to determine the worthiness of an applicant's claim to conscientious objection. Unlike the old adversarial proceedings which acted without parliamentary guidance on what constitutes conscientious objection, the tribunals would follow set guidelines as laid out in the Bill.

         I would imagine that there would be general agreement that the Parliament, rather than the judiciary, should be the body to determine what our society will accept as a basis for conscientious objection. Under the Bill, the definition of a person's conscientious belief is that it:
        </tab>

       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the absence of adversarial proceedings, the Government has ensured that the onus of proof must lie with the applicant. This is only reasonable as we are dealing with cases which could only occur, as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) said in his speech on the subject, `during a period of actual or apprehended enemy invasion of, or attack on, Australia'. Such is the threshold for conscription which exists under the present Act and which would be maintained in the new Bill—that is, under circumstances where one could confidently predict that the mainstream Australian community would support all reasonable measures to defend our continent. In other words, in circumstances where it would be appropriate for anybody who believed he conscientiously could not fight in defence of his homeland to prove the basis of that conscientious objection.

         In the Australian example, tribunals have become a very effective way of dealing with issues not suited to adversarial proceedings. Veterans have generally found that the Veterans Review Tribunal has worked effectively to gauge community liability in the case of war caused disabilities and the Administration Appeals Tribunal has been a useful forum for different groups of people who had need to challenge government department decisions. It is the Government's intention that people whose cases were lost before a conscientious objectors tribunal would be able to take their case to the Administration Appeals Tribunal, thus giving the individual the appropriate reserve opportunity to present his or her case.

         It is my understanding that the Opposition has two particular grievances with the legislation as it stands: firstly, it is not happy with the requirement that parliament must approve a conscription proclamation not more than 90 days before it comes into effect; and, secondly, the Opposition cannot rest comfortably with the concept of conscientious objection to particular conflicts, rather than war in general.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          As far as the first of these two points is concerned, I believe that the Opposition's concerns are understandable, but largely irrelevant in the real world. The fact is that conscription would only ever be used as a last-ditch measure to defend our shores. Although we can talk about different scenarios which could arise and which may, theoretically, limit our strategies because of the requirement for
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          </emphasis>
          parliament to approve a conscription proclamation not more than 90 days before it comes into effect, the reality is that both our government and our people would be well aware of the prospective problem before it arose. It is inconceivable to imagine that Australians would not rally to the cause where Australia was under threat, as it is inconceivable to imagine that our government of the time would not be taking appropriate logistical, administrative and military steps well ahead before conscription would need to be contemplated.

         The fact is that without a time limit the whole exercise of giving parliamentary conscription controls could become a useless charade. This Government wants to ensure that parliament considers conscription on a case by case basis. That can only be done by setting a time limit. A time that would be suitable for those purposes is 90 days. It is a short enough time to ensure that parliament is addressing the circumstances of a given conflict, yet it is long enough to grant flexibility in the case of rapidly escalating contingencies.

         Regarding the Opposition's second point of dispute to this legislation, I believe it is a pity that acceptance of neither genuine objection to a particular conflict cannot be recognised, nor the important legal principle of human rights which underpins the concept. The Government took its lead in the matter from the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which, in its 1985 report, unanimously recommended that conscientious objection by a particular conflict should be an accepted part of our legal framework. Acceptance of the Committee's recommendation has been government policy since 5 December 1986. In broad terms the Committee resolved that it was possible for a person's sense of personal integrity to be violated by compulsion to participate in one armed conflict, but not necessarily another. The Committee, in paragraph 2.15 of its report, said:

        Conscientious belief involves a seriously based conviction which is part of the core fundamental values of a person and which is expressed as an imperative having primacy in the life of the person concerned. To be coerced by law into acting in a way contrary to this imperative would be to experience a violation of one's integrity as a human being.

        Over recent weeks we have heard a great deal of negative comment from some members of the Opposition regarding this aspect of the Bill. We have heard that people will be able to claim political belief as a reasonable ground for conscientious objection; we have heard that the provision is a sop to multicultural interests in Australia; and we have been told that the floodgates will be opened to those who will dodge combatant service by claiming a deep-seated aversion to a given conflict.

         The Opposition's shadow Minister for defence in this House, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), in his speech on the matter has also said that conscientious objection to a particular conflict could only exist on a political basis if that person could commit to another conflict. All of this, of course, is incorrect. The shadow Minister has demonstrated, in my view, a very regrettable lack of ability to think laterally. If he cannot think of an instance where an individual might hold a strong and lasting moral aversion to a given conflict which may not be present in another conflict, I have badly overestimated his lateral thinking processes.

         Suffice it to say that I do not feel the necessity to outline examples to defend my position. The fact is that people claiming conscientious objection status will need to satisfy the firm definitions which will be laid down in the Bill. A cursory appraisal of those definitions by any fair-minded person would show that political inclination would hardly satisfy a tribunal of proof of conscientious objector status, nor indeed would ethnic background. We must remember that not only need the objectors' beliefs be fundamental in their conviction of right or wrong, they must be likely to be of a longstanding nature.

         As I said before, it is a pity that the Opposition has not supported the Government on this issue, if only because there is an important principle at stake. The reality of a direct threat to Australia—if I know the Australian public—is that support for our defence would be overwhelming. I can assure honourable members that there would be no queue of people claiming conscientious objector status, nor would there be any problem with those who have come to Australia over the course of the last generation or two, and it is stupid to suggest that there would be. Australians have a proud history of support for their country when the chips are down.

         What the Opposition has missed is that the fundamental significance of this legislation lies in the Parliament's recognition of the principle of conscientious objection in particular conflicts. This principle cannot be applied to particular categories of conflicts, such as whether we are talking about defence of our homeland or forward action. But, like all tenets of law, it must stand or fall as a general principle.

If we believe that it is possible to conscientiously object to one conflict but not to another—as the Government does and the Senate Committee did in 1985—then we must support a law that recognises and deals with such a contingency. The Government has put together a Bill which sensibly deals with the difficult issue of conscription. It is a Bill which follows a long line of similarly sensible and practical Bills in the defence arena of this Government, and I commend it to the House.

In the context of the Defence Act, `time of war' is defined as any time during which war actually exists, including the period between the issue of a proclamation of the existence of war and the actual declaration of war. `War' is defined as:

         The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill proposes that section 60(1) of the Defence Act be amended to require prior approval of a proclamation by resolution of each House of Parliament within the period before the proclamation comes into effect. In other words, the amendment will give Parliament the power of veto over an executive proposal to establish conscription. The coalition generally supports this proposal, although we have some misgivings about the 90-day rule.

The Act specifically excludes Aboriginal Australians from service. The Act also provides for priorities to be determined in regard to the calling up of persons within these specific categories; for example, younger men have a higher priority than males in the 45 to 60 age group.

         The coalition supports both the proposal to determine conscription classes and categories by regulation and the proposal to repeal the discriminatory elements in the existing Defence Act. The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill proposes some major changes in relation to conscientious objection to compulsory military service, including providing a clearer and more comprehensive definition of the term `conscientious belief', establishing a person's right to claim exemption from compulsory service in a particular war or warlike situation, clarifying the distinction between exemption from service with the ADF and exemption from duties of a combatant nature, and the establishment and provision for operational guidelines of new tribunals to determine claims for exemption from combatant or non-combatant duties on the grounds of conscientious objection and provision for an appeal mechanism through the appropriate court system. These elements of the Bill are largely based on the recommendations of the 1985 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs entitled

         </emphasis>
         , the introductory paragraphs canvass the complex issues which arise when the rights of an individual person may appear to clash with the rights of the community in which he or she lives. The report not only identifies this possible area of conflict between individual and state but also discusses both the right of individuals to act in accordance with their conscience and the right of the community to defend itself from threats to its existence. The report also recognises the particular obligations of a government in this regard including, if necessary, the supplementing of regular defence forces by means of conscription. The report states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On the one hand, there is the right of the community simply to exist, and, moreover, to exist with political structures freely determined by its citizens. The national community has the right to defend itself if such existence is threatened, and the government is obliged to ensure that the right is secured for the common good.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government may discharge its obligation by the waging of formally declared war or by entering upon some other form of military operation. The Commonwealth Government may consider that the fulfilment of its obligations requires that the military forces which can be raised by voluntary enlistment, be supplemented by conscription.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On the other hand, there is the right of the individual person to act in accordance with conscientiously held beliefs. This right requires that a person not be compelled by law to act contrary to a conscientiously held position such that, so to act would fundamentally impair his sense of integrity as a human being.

        The report acknowledges the long term acceptance by this Parliament of the principle of conscientious objection, and the need to provide exemption from compulsory military service for the people whose conscientious beliefs do not allow participation in any form of military service in any armed conflict. It also acknowledges this Parliament's recognition of the need to provide exemption from compulsory combatant duties for those whose conscientious beliefs may allow them to engage in non-combatant military service, as distinct from combatant duties, in any armed conflict. The report then proposes the introduction of a whole new category of conscientious objectors—those who object to engaging in a particular armed conflict but who may not necessarily have the same objection to participating in some other armed conflict.

         In arriving at its definitions, the Committee placed considerable weight on the analysis of conscientious belief provided by Professor Peter Singer. Professor Singer stated in his evidence to the Committee that in his view:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the only possible definition of a conscientious belief is a belief based on a seriously held moral conviction. That is, of course, very broad and it is perhaps best understood if we see what it leaves out. What it leaves out most clearly are beliefs based on selfish desires of one sort or another, personal interest, beliefs based on emotions like fear or ambition perhaps. It also leaves out beliefs which are whimsical or based on impulse.
       </para>
       <para>
        He then argued his belief:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . someone who opposed a particular war because they took the view that it could only add to suffering and the death of innocent civilians, without holding any religious basis for it, would be holding a conscientious objection to that particular war. A different war which it might be possible to fight by attacking only military targets they might not object to. So I would say that if we are to take seriously the notion of protecting conscience and giving way to people's conscientious beliefs, then we must extend conscientious objection to those who hold a sincere moral conviction against taking part in a particular war.

         Apart from other considerations, there is the dark grey area of what actually constitutes a specific conscientious belief, as compared, for example, with political dissent or opinion.

        </tab>

        The Committee hopes that its analysis of the distinction between the basis or ground of a belief and the belief itself may be helpful to those who fear that partisan political stance may masquerade as, or be substituted for, conscientious belief in such a way as to go far beyond the present provision so as to create a whole new set of relationships between individuals and their democratically-elected government.

        Unfortunately, much of the philosophical argument presented in the Committee's report only serves to reinforce this fear. It is a fear which was very clearly explained and very forcefully expressed to the Committee in evidence which was given by the then National Secretary of the RSL, Mr Ian Gollings. In his evidence, Mr Gollings said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The point that we have difficulty with is that an individual might make a distinction between one war, one conflict, one action and another on whatever grounds. We believe that the cases for discrimination between one war and another would most likely be of a political nature.

       <para>
        Mr Gollings also said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Because it is impossible to separate armed conflicts from the political context in which they arise, even defence against a direct threat to Australia, the exemptions for conscientious belief must be limited only to those genuine cases where individuals cannot accept the moral obligation for combatant service even in defence of their homeland.
       </para>
       <para>

         There is a very real danger that a clause permitting conscientious objection to particular conflicts would result in a deluge of claims for exemptions.

         As the amended Act would allow conscription only for the direct defence of Australia, the clause regarding conscientious objection to particular wars means Australian citizens could argue against their commitment and responsibility to defend their own country, whilst at the same time maintaining they would be willing to fight in overseas conflicts. Such a scenario is quite unacceptable. I would therefore urge the Government—and others who may be considering their support for this amendment—to rethink the ramifications of the specific conflicts clause. If the amendment regarding specific conflicts is passed, Australia will be the only country in the world to have legislated for a right of exemption to those who hold a conscientious objection to participation in a particular war.

         The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill is a very important, and in some ways historic, piece of legislation. Today has been a very interesting day in the Parliament; the statement on Aboriginal deaths in custody was delivered and now we are debating this legislation. Although the events have been treated as low-key by the media, both of them are very important in terms of the rights of Australians. They are issues which have affected Australians over many years. In Australia's history there have been a great deal of battles, debates and conflict over conscription. Just as we have had to wrestle with the questions concerning the Aboriginal people over the years, we have had to wrestle with the question of conscription.

         The previous speaker, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), raised a number of philosophical issues. There is a sense of deja vu because the argument that he has presented here today about objection to or having a conscientious belief in respect of particular wars was the very argument that was presented during the Vietnam war, when again his side of politics led the nation into a war situation which it claimed at that time was very much in the interests of the defence of the nation. Of course, nobody claims that now, looking at the outcome of the Vietnam war and the way events have unfolded.

         At that time, those opposite were arguing against the idea that one could have a conscientious objection to the Vietnam war. There was a very serious conflict in the community in relation to that matter. They legislated on the basis that if people were going to have a conscientious objection, it would be on the basis of some kind of religious or very fundamental conscientious belief. When people went before courts to have this belief tested, they were asked ridiculous questions such as, `Would you defend your own children if they were under attack?'—nonsense which should not be part of this kind of consideration.

         There was an analogy drawn between that and a conscientious objection to the Vietnam war even though it had nothing to do with the security or interests of Australia and was being promulgated, as Professor Singer makes clear in his comment, in a very dirty way—unfortunately, also by the side of the Allies. Therefore, in that context, it was possible for someone to conscientiously object to that war, but it was not allowed under Australian law at that time. A number of people, including a number of courageous young people who were conscripted, preferred to go to gaol to going to the Vietnam war because they had a conscientious belief against that war.

         We are now seeing a similar situation. It is not exactly the same, because, fortunately, as has been pointed out—and I commend both Ministers responsible, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), for the fact that this is in the legislation—we will not have any conscription unless it is based on a direct attack on Australia. That is the first point that has to be noted.

         Let us hope that we will never again need to have the sort of debates we have had in this country over a number of periods in its history when we have sent young men off to fight in wars which, in retrospect, have been very hard to justify, especially the First World War. The more Australia comes to grips with and understands its history, the more it will understand the disgraceful situation in which so many young Australians went to fight in a war that had so little to do with the interests of Australia—and were slaughtered.

         As we receive more evidence, we see they were sent to the slaughter in very bad military judgments. It is not an episode that we can be proud of. There certainly were gallant and brave people in the fighting, but the military nature of that exercise was foolish. The political goals of that war, especially in terms of the interests of Australia, are increasingly coming under question. I predict that as Australia evolves in its history there will be more and more questioning of that war, just as there is of our participation in the Vietnam war. Therefore, the issue of conscientious objection to particular wars is relevant.

         I believe that if we are going to have conscription legislation, the two aspects that have been brought in by the Government will be very important. The first concerns the question of there having to be a direct attack on Australia. No longer will we be conscripting young people to fight in wars that have nothing to do with a direct threat to this nation. That will be a very important aspect of this legislation.

         The second aspect concerns conscientious objection to particular wars. Admittedly, by the introduction of the clause that provides that we can have conscription only in the event of a direct attack on Australia, much of the heat is taken out of the argument. That is very important. The other aspect that is very important is that there are still circumstances in which it is possible for individuals to have genuine conscientious beliefs about particular conflicts and particular wars, even in the context of a direct attack on Australia. In that situation, I believe the matter needs to be looked at.

         I was talking about this very important legislation concerning conscription and the historical context in which we have to see it. I commend the Minister for bringing in this legislation which will now require parliamentary approval for conscription of any forces within Australia in the future. It is very important legislation; in fact, if we look at the context of what has occurred in Australian history with respect to the conscription issue, it is historic legislation.

         I was making some comments about the fact that the Opposition is always opposed to this idea of conscientious objection to particular wars, which it was during the time of the Vietnam war. A number of people were thrown in prison because they had conscientious objection to the Vietnam war. Now that we have this legislation, lo and behold, the Opposition says yes, it will support the legislation, but it is going to oppose the clause which deals with conscientious objection to particular conflicts and particular wars. This goes to show that Opposition members learn nothing from history.

         As I was commenting before, if we look at some of the wars in the history of Australia which the conservatives have brought us into, we will see that young people have had to go off and be slaughtered in wars that have had very little to do with fighting for the national interests of this country and very little to do with the political interests of this country, Unfortunately, we have had slaughter—I use the term advisedly—especially with respect to the First World War, where so many young people were slaughtered in a war that really had very little to do with Australia or its interests.

         This legislation has been drafted very carefully. It was based on a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which recommended a course  along these lines. I think we should pursue this legislation again, because we never know what may happen in the future. We have now limited the right of conscription. It will now involve a direct attack on Australia. No longer will we be able to conscript young people to go off and fight the wars just because it may be in the political interests of some government, in the future, to send people to fight that war. Firstly, conscription will have to do with a direct attack on Australia; and, secondly, it will allow for narrow, but genuine, conscientious objection on the basis of a particular war.

         I remind honourable members opposite that we were prepared to give away half of Australia when their predecessors were in government. It was only with the Curtin Government coming into power that we were able to start to defend this country, and we were not going to give up an inch of our soil. So we have a proud record on defence matters. At the same time, we also have a proud record on defence matters with Labor Party leaders, such as the great Prime Minister Curtin and later on Prime Minister Chifley, who were able to lead this nation in time of war and in time of peace. At the same time, we allow for genuine conscientious objection for people who have that belief. We certainly do not want people being conscripted to fight in foreign wars that have nothing to do with the interests of this nation, which has been the unfortunate record of the Opposition.

         —This omnibus Bill, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, covers three broad areas. Firstly, it introduces legislation dealing with technical amendments to five Acts: the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948, or DFRB;  the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973; the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987; the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990 and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991. Secondly, it repeals the National Service Act 1951 and the National Service Termination Act 1973. As a number of speakers have said previously, it substantially revises part IV of the Defence Act 1903 dealing with conscription and conscientious objection in relation to compulsory military service.

         Turning to the specifics of the first two areas of the Bill, a number of provisions in the DFRB 1948 Act are now obsolete, given that the scheme closed in 1972. Amendments in this Bill repeal the obsolete provisions which deal predominantly with fund contributions. The Defence Force superannuation legislation amendment of 1991 amended the DFRDB Act to enable the deputy of the chairman of the Authority to preside at meetings in the absence of the chairman, and take precedence over the deputy chairman. Subsection 14(3) of that Act, which enables a quorum to be made up of the chairman or deputy chairman and two or more members, requires amendment so that a quorum may also be made up of the deputy to the chairman and two or more members. An amendment in this Bill provides for that.

         An amendment to the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987 extends the appointments by the Governor-General to the Authority to include the Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Personnel) as the fourth member of the Defence Force in that forum.

         The Defence Housing Authority Act which establishes a home loans assistance scheme for members of the Defence Force makes special provisions for incapacitated persons. The current definition in section 3 covers incapacitated persons who are discharged because of a compensable disability on or after the commencing day, 21 January 1991. An unintended consequence of this is that some incapacitated persons who joined the Defence Force after 14 May 1985, the cut-off point for eligibility under the old defence service homes scheme, and were discharged before 21 January 1991, are not covered by either the old or the new scheme. This Bill amends section 3 to ensure that the definition `incapacitated person' includes persons who are not currently covered by either scheme. The Bill also amends section 4 of the principal Act so that incapacitated persons who are affected by the amended definition have two years to exercise their entitlement.

         Finally, to have an entitlement to a home loan under the Act, a member must be issued with an entitlement certificate. Section 13 enables certificates to be cancelled where they are found to be issued as a result of false or misleading statements or where entitlement did not exist. However, there is no provision to vary or reissue certificates in order to correct errors or omissions. The proposed amendment in this Bill will enable the Secretary to the Department of Defence who issues certificates to vary or reissue them effective from the time the original certificate was issued.

         Section 47 of the Military Superannuation Benefits Act 1991 personally indemnifies the trustees of the board of trustees, the Commissioner of Superannuation and the staff assisting the Commissioner from any action, liability claim or demand arising from a bona fide performance of their duties or functions. These amendments extend the indemnity provisions to cover an acting trustee, a member of an incapacity classification committee and a member of a reconsideration advisory committee. Notwithstanding these amendments, the corporate liability of the board as a whole is retained. The Opposition supports all of these technical, albeit unexceptional, amendments.

         In relation to the National Service Act aspects, the 1951 National Service Act provided for registration and compulsory military conscription into the armed forces. The 1973 National Service Termination Act nullified it, but the Whitlam Government did not repeal the 1951 Act so as to preserve the entitlements of those who served under the terms of that Act. The Bill before us preserves legislative provisions where it is necessary to protect entitlements accrued through rendering national service. Importantly, repealing the 1951 Act precludes the option of implementing conscription. The capacity to order this is legislated for, as the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) said before me, in the Defence Act 1903.

         The Bill before us proposes to alter the Defence Act 1903 with regard to national service in three ways: it requires prior parliamentary approval for conscription; it removes discriminatory provisions from the 1903 Act; it removes from the 1903 Act the subsection defining specific classes of people who can and cannot be conscripted. It also establishes that classes of people conscripted will be determined by regulation rather than by the Defence Act.

         I now turn to conscription. Section 60(1) of the Defence Act enables the Government to introduce conscription for service in the Defence Force in time of war via a proclamation by the Governor-General. Of course, `war' is defined under section 4(1) of the Act as:

        The Bill before us amends the Defence Act to require prior approval of a proclamation by resolution of each House of parliament within the period of 90 days before the proclamation comes into effect. While this amendment will give parliament the necessary power of veto over an executive proposal to establish conscription, it has the potential, in the Opposition's view—this point being made very strongly last night by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and I quote him—`to hamstring the Australian Defence Force further' because of this 90-day rule. I do not intend to say any more about that at this stage. That will be covered in the committee stage.

         On existing discrimination provisions, the present Defence Act includes clauses limiting conscription to male, British citizens and, of course, excludes Aboriginal Australians from service. This Bill repeals these sections, leaving the requirement that conscripts have been resident in Australia for at least six months and be between the ages of 18 and 60. The honourable member for Groom, as does the honourable member for Casey, falls into that same category. Of course, the Opposition supports this move away from discrimination.

         On conscientious objection, this Bill deals with it in the following terms: it defines more clearly the term `conscientious belief'; it establishes the right for a person to claim exemption from compulsory service in a particular war or warlike situation—I will have more to say about that later—it clarifies the distinction between exemption for service in the ADF and exemption from duties of a combatant nature; it establishes new tribunals to determine claims of conscientious objection; it provides guidelines for the operation of these tribunals; and it provides for an appeal mechanism through the appropriate court system.

         The Bill seeks to add greater definitional clarity to the term `conscientious belief' by repealing the present provisions and by adding the requisite factors of a fundamental conviction of what is morally wrong, whether or not based on religious considerations; so compelling in nature for that person that he or she is duty bound to espouse it. It is likely to be of a long-standing nature. Although still very wide in scope, this definition is useful in as much as it provides some criteria for assessing the validity of a claim to conscientious objection. The Bill also adds a new section to the Act, section 61(CV), which places the onus of proof on the applicant to demonstrate that objections to service are genuinely founded on conscientious beliefs. The Opposition agrees generally with this rationale.

         I turn now to the second important point with which the Opposition disagrees and on which a number of previous speakers have had a few words to say. I refer to a  conscientious objection to a particular war. The present Defence Act provides for conscientious objection only in so far as these values are applied to military service in all wars at all times. The Bill proposes to change that by making the following addition to section 61(A)(1)(i) of the Act specifying exemptions for persons whose conscientious beliefs do not allow them to participate in a particular war or warlike operation.

         According to the Government's argument, an individual with specific conscientious objections to a particular war should be excluded from military service, providing those objections are based on fundamental convictions rather than particular political objections to the conflict. The merits of this approach were discussed, as a number of speakers have mentioned, by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in its 1985 report. That Committee noted in part the RSL's objections to the proposal that conscientious objection could be applied exclusively to participation in a specific conflict but not to participation in all conflicts. As war is a political instrument, the RSL argued, distinctions between objections to service based on fundamental convictions as opposed to simple political objections to service could not be made in practice. The Committee unfortunately rejected the RSL position, saying that `something more than political dissent is required'. It went on to say:

        In practical terms, it is difficult to see how such a distinction could be made, especially given the wide definition which has been applied to the term `conscientious belief'.

         Despite what the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) had to say there is, in my view and in the view of the Opposition, a danger that the existence of a clause permitting conscientious objection to specific conflicts would result in a flood of claims for exemptions. Given that the Bill defines `conscious belief' very broadly and that the Defence Act allows for conscription only for the direct defence of Australia but not for the commitment of forces overseas, the clause allowing for objection to specific wars is opposed by the Opposition. At the very least, the clause raises questions about whether it is acceptable to legislate so that citizens can refuse to defend their own country at the same time as maintaining that they would be prepared to fight in other conflicts.

        Lastly in relation to this Bill, the present Defence Act specifies classes of citizens with a view to determining the priority with which they can be called up. For example, class I comprises unmarried males between 18 and 35 years; and class V, males between 45 and 60 years. It allows for a proclamation to further divide the classes into smaller age groups, but specifies that a call-up would have to observe the age order specified in the classes.

         The Bill repeals this and leaves it to subordinate legislation to establish a series of classes of persons for call-up. The purpose is to give greater freedom of action with regard to determining what categories of people can in fact be called up. This is a worthwhile objective because the classes outlined in the Defence Act unnecessarily constrain the Executive's flexibility to determine the order and priorities of conscription. In a modern war, the aim of conscription may be directed at recruiting specific skills into the Defence Force, rather than the mobilisation of a mass army. The present Defence Act provisions are therefore inappropriate to present-day requirements. On this basis, the Opposition supports this view.

One of the benefits of having this close contact with a section of the defence forces is that it affords one the opportunity of keeping abreast of the effects of policy decisions on service life, especially the legislative decisions that are made in this national Parliament.

         I have the privilege of being able to reflect on my own experience in the services during my period of national service in 1953 and subsequently as a member of the Sydney University CMF regiment. They were enjoyable times, and the lessons I learned from those experiences have held me in good stead ever since.

         In speaking on this Bill, I would like to focus my comments on those areas that amend existing conscription laws. In particular, I will be speaking on clause 9(d), which amends section 61A of the principal Act and relates to conscientious objection. Before I move on to those specifics, I wish to take this opportunity to make some general comments regarding the whole question of conscription. As I mentioned previously, I have had first-hand knowledge of conscription and, although I look upon that experience as a very positive time in my life, I also appreciate that many people do not look upon it in such a favourable light. It is a very emotive issue, especially when we are engaged in military conflict, and the public reaction during the recent Gulf war bears testimony to that. Certainly, we all remember the reaction to conscripts being sent to Vietnam.

         It was interesting that on 22 January 1991 the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) when speaking on the Middle East ministerial statement made the observation that, for his electorate, the matter of conscription needed urgent clarification. He remarked that the Vietnam experience, even after 25 years, was still fresh in the minds of our people—and, indeed, it was and is. Although the Whitlam Government repealed the National Service Act of 1973, there is obviously still a great deal of public concern regarding the possibility of future governments committing themselves to a program of conscription. I was interested to note fairly recent support for peacetime conscription by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fisher) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), although it must be said that they were speaking independently of their parties in this instance.

         Military service can play a tremendously helpful role in developing in our young people qualities that will stay with them through their adult life. However, my research leads me to believe that, apart from anything else, the cost of such a program is quite prohibitive, especially in times of recession. The Leader of the National Party made this point back in January 1991, and the same is true today.

         At this point I would like to put in a plug to the Minister about the need for him and Senator Ray to look very hard at the call from a lot of schools, for example, for the reintroduction of cadet training. In my own electorate, at Katoomba in the Blue Mountains I have one of the healthiest and largest cadet units in the country. There are over 75 members in that cadet corps with a waiting list at one stage, I believe, of almost 100. It is not attached to a school but is just a cadet unit being run in that town, where it is flourishing. In Penrith, we have similar excellent cadet units that are run extremely well. It is always a great pleasure for me to go their graduation ceremonies. I am very proud of the young people who are there and who receive the awards.

         I would like to commend people like Ollie Hume, who is one of the driving forces in the Katoomba unit in terms of providing the very qualities that we were talking about earlier. The Leader of the National Party referred to the qualities that develop in young people as a result of doing their national service, and the same qualities result from the experience of younger people in the cadets. It is not conscription; it is all on a voluntary basis. I commend that to the Minister. I would love to see him in my electorate on some occasion just to encourage the citizens who are involved, and the young people in particular.

         Getting back to the point of the prohibitive costs, my figures are based on updated figures prepared in 1986 by the defence group of the research service in the Parliamentary Library. They are very interesting indeed. Based on the assumptions that for a one-year engagement all 18-year-old males are eligible, 50 per cent of those examined by a doctor will be rejected as unfit for service, conscripts will be paid the same rate of pay, and women are not involved, we find that about 52,500 of 18-year-old men would be conscripted in each year of the scheme. As the bottom salary of the bottom ranking grade of private soldier in the Army is $19,281 per annum and associated living and training costs would inflate this to around $39,000 per man, this would yield a personnel cost of about $2 billion.

         I therefore reluctantly have to agree that it does not take long to see how prohibitive the costs would be if this were to be introduced. This is without taking into consideration the fact that the ratio of conscripts to regulars is 1 : 3, which would mean that we would need a Regular Army of about 153,000 just to cope with the training program. Then we would need to build new accommodation and training facilities, buy additional equipment and allow for the additional costs to administer and enforce the scheme. In light of the amendments contained in this legislation that repeal the discriminatory elements of the principal Act, the financial impact of conscripting both male and female would be substantially increased over and above what has already been stated.

         The problem is, however, separating fundamental objections from political objections. Given the wide definition which is applied to the term `conscientious belief', it is particularly difficult to see how one could make the distinction. Under the terms of this amendment, we could find that some citizens may refuse to defend their own country while at the same time maintain that they are prepared to fight in other conflicts. In conclusion, I join my coalition colleagues in opposing any amendments which apply the right to conscientious objection to specific conflicts, rather than to a general opposition to conflict.

We undoubtedly see the story that they have been able to get across. This concerned me, and I made a note of one or two things the honourable member for Calwell mentioned. He emphasised the fact, and this is very true within the legislation, that conscription will only take place in very extreme circumstances. I do not disagree with that as I think that is quite correct. He said that if Australia was attacked, then we would conscript.

History repeats itself time and time again over the decades and the centuries. Unfortunately, as far as wars are concerned, we have to be prepared.

I believe it would be a wonderful thing if we could afford to have national service in this country.

Incorporated in this training would be an apprenticeship of some kind, which I believe is commonsense. He has gone to all the trouble of pointing out a complete scheme. A person could be trained to be a member of the police force, a carpenter or an engineer. Over the two years he or she would receive at least one year of Army training and for the other year would be involved in some apprenticeship training to equip that person to enter the work force.

We are wasting a great deal of the unemployment relief that we are paying to young people today. It is certainly keeping them, but as far as they and this nation are concerned it is going down the drain. We are teaching them hardly anything. We are not teaching them a thing.

         Let me return to the Bill before the House. I agree with all of the utterances of the members of the Opposition who have spoken on this legislation. We broadly agree with the Bill. There are facts about it that have been fully explained here. It seems to me that 90 days after the proclamation is a long time. I think that is in clause 60 of the Bill. I would also say to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) that on many of these matters we can never overrule—I do not believe that it is time to do so;  I am not averting to that—the chiefs of staff of our defence forces. The honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) mentioned this a while ago. It is very important. It is similar to the situation with the Commissioner of Police, Federal or State.

         Honourable members know what I mean. A Minister can be in control of something, but the chiefs are running their ship. I think they should be allowed every opportunity to do so without being interfered with, not only by a Minister but also by a government or members of the Parliament. I am aware that the Government would like to get the legislation through. It has a big agenda. I am pleased to be able to contribute to the debate on this Bill.

         A number of those matters have not attracted much attention, but they did attract support. I will just refer briefly to them. They are, first of all, the provisions of the Bill which do not relate to conscientious objection, those which amend the Defence Housing Authority Act to enable the Defence Force Assistant Chief of Personnel to be appointed to the authority. I think that was referred to by one or two speakers, notably the honourable member for Groom. Next are the amendments which are referred to as finetuning amendments to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1900, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991. They are totally uncontentious provisions. Thirdly are the provisions of the Bill which repeal obsolete provisions of the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Act 1948. All of those were supported by all speakers who referred to them and did not attract much debate at all.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Similarly, there are a number of provisions in the part of the Bill which deals with conscription that seemed to meet with general approbation. They are the provisions which repeal the National Service Act 1951 and the National Service Termination Act 1973; the provisions which require prior parliamentary approval for conscription—though the question of the 90 days did attract a certain amount of attention, and I will return to that; and the provisions which define the expression `conscientious belief'.

         The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs—which, I suppose we could say, inspired this Bill—gave a good deal of attention to how to define a conscientious belief, and I think that from all sides of the House there was agreement that it was right to set out what it is that constitutes conscientious belief.

         Another provision which met with approbation is the provision that tribunals shall be set up to consider claims by individuals that they held a conscientious belief, a conscientious objection to war. Again, in the past, as the House would know, tests of conscientious belief have had to be made before courts in an adversarial atmosphere and not in the way that this Bill provides. It is unlikely, of course, that those tribunals will ever be set up, but I believe it is proper that they work in the way described by the Bill and that they have the option—and indeed the obligation—when finding in favour of a person who claims a conscientious objection to war or to a particular war, to compel that individual to take part in non-combat service rather than in combat.

         The provisions of the legislation which repeal the present discriminatory provisions—those which discriminate against women, Aboriginals, and non-Australian residents, and make them all equally liable for call-up in the event of conscription—attracted general support in the debate.

         Finally, the provision which allows for call-up in an order of classes as prescribed by regulation attracted favourable comment. It is the case that in future wars we may very well not have a requirement for a mass mobilisation, divisions and divisions of infantry, but rather will need the ability to conscript persons of particular skills, of particular talents and from particular classes. Again, that provision was generally approved.

         I listened with particular care to the remarks of those who addressed this issue in what was a very interesting debate. I thought, if I might say so, that the honourable member for Casey participated in the debate in a very thoughtful way when he recited from and reflected upon chapter 2 of the 1985 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on this matter. Might I recommend it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because it makes very good reading in its discussion on the rights of the community, which has to continue to exist in the way the community determines, on the one hand with political structures freely determined by its citizens and, on the other, with the right of individual persons to act in accordance with their conscientiously held beliefs. That is a right, of course, which has always been recognised in our kind of society and it goes back a very long way to our roots in the United Kingdom.

         —These are things which are at the root of a liberal society and which I believe this legislation takes account of. On this question of a particular war, I thought I might quote from the evidence of Professor Peter Singer to the Committee. He argues in favour of the possibility of conscientious objection to a particular war. In his evidence he said this:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I believe that someone who opposed a particular war because they took the view that it could only add to suffering and the death of innocent civilians, without holding any religious basis for it, would be holding a conscientious objection to that particular war. A different war which it might be possible to fight by attacking only military targets they might not object to. So I would say that if we are to take seriously the notion of protecting conscience and giving way to people's conscientious beliefs then we must extend conscientious objection to those who hold a sincere moral conviction against taking part in a particular war. If we do not do that we are simply making an arbitrary distinction between two forms of conscientious belief which are equally conscientious.
       </para>
       <para>
        That quote is from page 9 of the Committee's report. It was argued by a number of witnesses before that Committee that conscientious belief had to be against all war in general or not at all. I believe that a number of speakers shared that point of view in the debate.

         A couple of speakers, including the honourable member for Casey, quoted from the Returned Services League evidence to the Committee, and I want to deal with that because it is given some prominence here. This is again from the report of the Committee. It reads:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Returned Services League of Australia (R.S.L) found it well nigh impossible to distinguish specific conscientious belief from political dissent. The R.S.L. view was put most forcefully by the National Secretary, Mr Ian Gollings:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The point that we have difficulty with is that an individual might
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         make a distinction between one war, one conflict, one action and another on whatever grounds. We believe that the cases for discrimination between one war and another would most likely be of a political nature.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Gollings goes on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        We find it difficult to determine just what an individual would state as his grounds for objection to participation in a particular war unless they were of a political nature.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the RSL had real difficulty—and one can appreciate it—in distinguishing what circumstances might arise which would lead an individual to take conscientious objection to a particular war or conflict but not to others. The Committee rejected that view and said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Parliament should add to its present recognition of absolute conscientious belief, recognition of specific conscientious belief so as to grant exemption from participation in a particular military conflict where to be compelled by law to do so would violate the individual's sense of personal integrity.
       </para>
       <para>
        And it goes on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill should be redrafted so that it indicates neither an exemplary nor exhaustive list of grounds for the conscientious belief.
       </para>

        In other words, it will not give examples, nor does the Bill; and it will not set out an exhaustive list of grounds, nor does the Bill.

         I believe I might help the House if I said that I could be persuaded that somebody might, say, object specifically to participation in an invasion of Australia where he or she were called up, where the front line of the enemy consisted of women or, indeed, as we have seen in wars recently in the Middle East, where the front line consisted of 14-year-old children. A person, particularly a woman who was called up, for example, might say, `Look, I do not object to defending my country; I have no conscientious objection to war in general; but I cannot bring myself to participate on grounds of moral conscience in this particular war where I am called on to shoot or kill people of my own sex'. That may not be a belief that appeals to the honourable member for Mayo, or to other members in this House, but I can see that the possibility could arise and I can see that it would be a moral objection, a conscientious objection. There could be similar instances in a particular war which had to be pursued by means which an individual found horrific, perhaps the use of particular weapons—napalm, as has happened in the past, or something of that kind.

         I believe that the occasions when a person would argue that they did not object to being called up for a war in general but for a specific war would be rare. As the RSL has said, they are difficult to imagine, but I believe they are imaginable, and I believe that it is right for this legislation to allow for that possibility.

         The other area which attracted debate was the question of the 90-day limit. I believe there was a great deal of misunderstanding about this provision. Certainly, the right honourable member for New England appeared to believe that the legislation required that one had to wait 90 days before the Parliament could consider this question. That is a misunderstanding. The legislation provides that the approval must be given within 90 days.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In the view of the Committee, the reason for that was that, if there was an unlimited time, the relevance of the approval to the particular conflict would be lost. In other words, if we could approve in 1992 a blanket approval for conscription in the event of a conflict and that were not, as it were, brought into effect until 1995, the relevance of parliament approving that conscription for that conflict would be entirely lost—it would be a blanket approval and not one specific to the circumstances. It is a pretty simple point. Otherwise, it would mean that the situation would be a charade. That is the reason the 90 days is there. I must say that I am not entirely clear what the objection to it is, unless it is purely a misunderstanding.

         I believe I have commented on the main points that were raised during the debate. I conclude by thanking honourable members for what were thoughtful contributions to the debate. I leave out of account those remarks which were well and truly outside the scope of the debate. The honourable member for Macquarie, for example, referred to defence expenditures in Australia and regarded them as too low. I raised by way of interjection how then the coalition proposed to lessen those expenditures. He instanced the example of Senegal—that was the only example he gave—as a country which we should attempt to emulate in our defence expenditures.

         This is not a major matter. The reason the coalition has decided to move this fairly technical amendment is not, as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) suggested, that we are somehow confused about it, but because we believe in these matters that it is extremely important to retain as much flexibility as is possible. With all of these defence issues flexibility really lies at the key of any successful defence undertaking. That applies to conscription as much as it applies to issues such as equipment or what happens to regular forces.

         By imposing the 90-day provision so that the Parliament has to give its approval no more than 90 days before the proclamation for conscription actually comes into effect—it is not very likely that it would arise as a problem—the Government is limiting the flexibility of the Parliament and the Executive to put conscription into place over what might be necessarily a longer period.

         I cannot anticipate the circumstances in which conscription would be required at all because I am not anticipating an imminent invasion of Australia, but one never knows the circumstances in which it would take place if it should ever happen. In those circumstances, I think the wiser course of action is to retain flexibility. That is the reason the Opposition is moving those two amendments.

         —I had the feeling that the Opposition's heart was not in these amendments and that has been confirmed. A fundamental assumption that the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs made when it reported was that Parliament should approve conscription when it became necessary to do so—not years beforehand or many months beforehand. Parliamentary approval which was not given, sought, or debated in the context of those particular circumstances would defeat the purpose of the Committee's report and, hence, of this Bill.

         I believe that 90 days is a reasonable lead time, because it would ensure that the Parliament had to address the circumstances of a particular conflict, but would certainly allow all the flexibility which my colleague the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has referred to, to avoid, for example, recalling the Parliament during a recess. It is perhaps worth noting that the current provisions require the Parliament to be summoned within 10 days of publication of a conscription proclamation. We believe this proves the legislation rather than the reverse.

        These amendments relate to conscientious objection in a particular war, a matter on which the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) spoke at some length. In addressing this issue, I want to make a few remarks in response to what the Minister said about this issue in summing up the second reading stage of the Bill.

         We believe that conscription can be objected to on the basis of a conscientious belief, which perhaps would be of a religious or some other nature. One can understand the circumstances in which that could happen. In other words, it would be a conscientious belief based on objection to the whole concept of war.

         In the case of a particular war, I think it has to be said that we on this side of the House very strongly agree with the proposition that was put to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, from which the Minister quoted at some length, that if there is to be an objection to any particular war, that objection is going to be little short of a political objection and there is not going to be a great deal more to it than that. As the Minister found when he tried to examine examples in which one could object on a conscientious basis to participating in a particular war, it is very hard to imagine circumstances in which that objection could be anything but political, and he conceded that.

         It has been put to us that people may object for religious reasons. This was not raised by the Minister. For example, Australia could be subject to an invasion by a Muslim country or a Muslim group and Muslims within Australia may take the view that they would not wish to fight against brother Muslims. That underlines this whole question of the test of loyalty to Australia. The fundamental loyalty of citizens of this country must be a loyalty to this country. It is not something that is divisible. A fundamental component of political philosophy in so-called Anglo-Saxon countries for many a century has been the indivisibility of the sovereignty of the country and the loyalty of its citizens to it.

         If we go back to the sixteenth century and the debate about the reformation and the decision by Henry VIII to sever the ties with Rome—as I am sure your recollection would, Mr Deputy Chairman; of course, there was much more to that issue than there is to this one—we see that one of the arguments that was promoted by those in favour of the separation from Rome was that citizens had a loyalty to their own nation and to their colleagues within that nation, their fellow people.

         By the very same argument, we on this side of the House do not believe that loyalty to Australia is something that should be divisible. If this country is subject to invasion, other than having some quite rare conscientious objection to doing anything whatsoever to participate in any kind of military activity, Australian citizens have an obligation if called up under conscription to make a contribution to the protection of this country, not to leave it to others and not to have a divisible view of loyalty to Australia. That is really why we object to this part of the Bill.

         The Minister used a couple of examples which, frankly, I thought confirmed our argument completely. He gave one example of what would happen if the front line of the enemy were women and people decided that they would not be prepared to fight against women. If Australia was subject to this sort of Amazon invasion that the Minister apparently has in mind and large numbers of Australians decided they would not fight against women, what would that tell a potential enemy? The way to invade Australia is with a force of women. It is a quite fatuous proposition.

         The Minister uses the example of 14-year-old teenagers being in the front line of an invading force. The argument is exactly the same. If we as a country, more generally, were to take the view that we would not fight and defend our country against women—a very sexist view and one that I would have thought the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission would wish to examine—or against people who, admittedly, by the standards of our civilisation, were under-age to participate in a war, we would be throwing open our whole country. We are simply saying that all an enemy needs to do is to put together a particular composition of an attacking force and it can have what it likes. I must admit that that is quite an extraordinary proposition for the Minister to have put forward.

         He raised a third example, which I think came from Professor Singer, whom he quoted as one of the people who appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, which has been much quoted in the context of this debate. I am not sure whether I am right, but I think he was quoting Professor Singer in this case. He said that people may decide not to participate in a war because Australia had decided to attack civilian targets rather than military targets, or that there was some concoction of our defence strategy in defence of our nation which they felt uncomfortable about. Again it leaves open the field to anybody who wishes to invade Australia to confuse issues in relation to the types of targets that could be attacked, thereby making the country all the more vulnerable.

         I conclude on the point that we believe that this issue is about nationhood and loyalty to Australia. It does not sit comfortably with the latest craze in the Labor Party—one which doubtless will pass fairly soon—to say, `We're more nationalistic than you on the other side of the House'. It is a very funny sort of concept. It is the latest craze for Government members, on the one hand, to argue that and, on the other hand, to argue that loyalty to this country is something which is effectively divisible.

I must admit that I would be very disappointed, in the face of the arguments that I have put to the Minister tonight, if he did not change his stubborn mind on this issue and support these amendments which are being put forward by the coalition.

         —The disappointment is all mine. It really is an unhappy thing for a fellow South Australian to be as obtuse and unable to appreciate the arguments that I have put forward, particularly someone who has been trained at university. It is pretty clear that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has not read chapter 2 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. He puts the argument for the indivisibility of loyalty in a nation. He says that this has been very much a part of the tradition of countries such as ours for some centuries. He is right.

         Equally, a part of the tradition of countries such as ours is the individuality of conscience. It is not for the state to say to a person, `You may not believe such and so because loyalty demands otherwise of you'. It has always been part of the tradition of dissent of a liberal democracy that conscience is individual. It does not matter whether or not I agree, whether the honourable member for Mayo agrees, or whether this entire chamber agrees as to whether such a proposition is persuasive or not. If an individual person says and sustains in the way that this legislation proposes, as a matter of conscientious belief, that he or she may not do something because it will offend his or her conscience, that is his or her right. That may be sustained in respect of war, in general, just as much as it may be sustained in respect of a particular conflict.

        These cannot be trivial beliefs; they cannot be frivolous beliefs; they cannot be beliefs which have been arrived at the day before. They must be very deeply held. It may be impossible for the honourable member for Mayo to imagine that somewhere in Australia there is a person who cannot bring himself, as a matter of conscience, to engage in a war in which he may directly have to kill a woman or he may directly have to kill a child. But I can imagine it. This legislation encompasses the possibility of it.

         If an enemy were predicating his strategy in attacking Australia on what he supposes the conscientious beliefs of numbers of Australians will be, I think that would be a pretty silly enemy to start with. I think the numbers of people who would exercise the conscientious belief to a war in general, or much less so to a particular war, would be minuscule. Bear in mind that in the Vietnam war—the most divisive war politically, socially and, dare I say, morally in this society in my lifetime—only one in about 1,000 of those who were called up claimed the right of conscientious objection. So the numbers that would be likely to be involved in the event of a direct or apprehended attack on Australia would not just be minuscule, they would be completely and utterly negligible. It is to make a Mount Everest out of an anthill for the honourable member for Mayo to construct the kind of objection to it that he does in moving the amendment.

         —Very briefly, I respond to the remarks that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) made. He presupposes that the number of conscientious objectors to an individual or a particular war—to use the language of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill—would be negligible on the evidence that there were only one in a thousand conscientious objectors in the case of the Vietnam war. I would have to say that the provision for conscientious objection in the case of a particular war—that is the case of the Vietnam war in this example—did not exist. If it had existed—one does not know—those figures could have been substantially higher. It may not be of great concern to us today whether the numbers were higher, lower or whatever they may have been. We would all have views about that.

         My point is that in the event of a particular war, there would conceivably be—and I say conceivably be, but we have to take this into account when considering legislation—a large number of people who would find a way of exercising a conscientious objection to that particular war. Why do I say that? I say it for two reasons. People do not want to be at war. I am sure that I am no exception. I am sure that I am not one Australian out of 17 million in saying that the last thing I want to do as a human being is to go to war. One of the reasons that I do not want to go to war is that I do not want to be shot at or shot. I would have to say that it is also true of me and my fellow country men and women that we do not want to kill people; we do not want to kill children, as the Minister put it; we do not want to kill 14-year-olds; we do not want to kill women. But I am not so sexist as to say—and I am sure that most people would agree with this—that we would perhaps enjoy killing men just ever so slightly more than we would enjoy killing women.

         The fact is that people do not want to go to war; they do not want to kill, and that is understandable and typical. But in the case of the country being subject to an invasion, there would be a percentage of the population that would rather get out of the gruesome task of defending our country and simply leave it to others. I find it hard to believe that any Australian would want to see his country invaded and taken over by a foreign power. But there is probably a proportion of the population that would be quite happy to leave the gruesome task of defending our country to other people. That has, of course, happened in past conflicts—not just in relation to this country, but in relation to many countries.

         Conscription is an unhappy situation. It is compelling people to do something which they, almost by definition, do not want to do. By providing this provision for a conscientious objection in the case of a particular war, the Government is opening up a Pandora's box—to use a very popular cliche. One just does not know what the tribunal would rule. We remain very strongly of the view that objections in the case of particular wars are going to be based on political feelings and political attitudes; consequently, we do not regard the amendment as satisfactory.

         —The package of deer industry Bills in total means that the industry has requested and the Government has agreed to the imposition on a share basis of government and industry of a research and development arrangement for this new industry. I believe that this new industry is an example, along with many other agricultural industries in Australia, of agriculture being one of the great sunrise industries of this country. Such industries always have flexibility and are innovative and inventive. Along with mining, being the most internationally exposed and oriented of our industries, they are more responsive to market demands internationally.

         Among these new sunrise agricultural industries, the goat industry is a very significant one, whether it is for cashmere, for mohair or for meat. Unfortunately, the fibre section has suffered a similar downturn to that which impacted on the wool industry. Hopefully that is coming good again. At the present time a new genetic material, the Texan angora, is being released, shortly to be followed by the release of what is considered to be the world's best angora goats, those from strains from South Africa and Zimbabwe. These will really give a lift to this most important new industry in Australia.

         In horticulture there is a whole range of new varieties. In my area of northern Victoria the Nashi or Asian pear is replacing, to a certain extent, the European pear in response to the market demands of Asia. One looks at the new tropical horticultural fruits that are being planted and at the development of the tea and coffee industry. We have some more exotic new industries, such as the ostrich, emu and crocodile industries. The water buffalo industry has taken something of a pounding because of the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign, but it will come back again. Some animals are classified as wild animals and therefore cannot be commercialised. I think particularly of the kangaroo. If commercialisation of the kangaroo were permitted, we would have a very good industry with a very good form of low cholesterol meat.

         The grains industry is probably the best example of new varieties and responses to new markets. When one thinks of the varieties of grains grown in this country 20 years ago compared with those today, it is an amazing development. It covers coarse grains, oil seeds and legumes, and we were talking about that to a certain extent in Parliament last week. For example, canola results from the basic restructuring of an old variety to give a very high percentage of unsaturated oil. A large variety of beans and lupins are now commercially available. The deer industry ranks with all of these agricultural industries. At the moment some would say it is probably the most successful.

         —I accept that, even if it is rather dear to get into at present. It is expanding at a very rapid rate, at about 25 per cent a year. There are about 1,000 farmers full or part time in that industry, and 155,000 deer—and that number will double in a few years. It is also an important export industry. It is a significant, and will be an even more significant, new agricultural industry. It has determined by its application to the Government for inclusion in the research and development arrangements to be more commercial, to be better able to target what it is after, and to embark upon the necessary research that is required if it is to maintain a competitiveness against the industries of other countries—and one thinks here particularly of New Zealand.

         There is already a voluntary arrangement in place which the industry has instituted ahead of the statutory system, and about $25,000 has been donated. When it joins the statutory arrangements in the near future, it will join over 20 other agricultural industries on the same basis of a dollar for dollar, up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. That will cost the Government an estimated $30,000 next financial year, and $60,000 the following year.

         It is encouraging that the industry, from its first year, is evidently prepared to provide more than is necessary for the matching grants. Its contribution will be $100,000. It is not unique among these new industries, or the industries that are coming into the research and development arrangements, in being prepared to go beyond the Government target. That was true also of some of the coarse grain industries that we were talking about recently in this Parliament. Once again I make the point that agriculture sets an example to other industries in this country of being prepared to make sacrifices for a solid research and development base, even in very difficult times. This will ensure that, in spite of the problems they have of a very high domestic cost structure, corrupt international markets, et cetera, those industries will survive.

         The decision of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia has been a very important one, and I congratulate that organisation for making that decision. It has not been without some criticism within the industry. Not everybody in the industry supports it. I suppose it would be unique, actually, if that were the case. There are two problems that I hope the industry can sort out in the next few weeks. The first is to obtain that full support and, secondly, to have clarified one of the problems which I gather has led to some of the criticism or some of the uncertainty, and that is this question of double levies or double taxation. I hope the Minister can clarify that once and for all tonight. The industry has demonstrated very significant majority support and, therefore, those opposed to the proposal, in my view, do not support a significant minority which in any way should interfere with this legislation.

         I will detail some of the steps ahead of this legislation, which in my view indicate a good relationship between the Department and the industry and within the industry itself. There has been plenty of opportunity for the necessary discussion, communication, et cetera. In 1989 there was a deer industry workshop sponsored by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. On 22 March 1991, the annual meeting of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia passed unanimously a motion to proceed with the statutory levy requirement. The Tasmanian section of the industry was a member at that time and participated in that unanimous vote. In August 1991 at a national conference at Albury, attended by over 300 deer breeders, once again there was a unanimous vote for a voluntary levy until the statutory levy commenced. On 9 October 1991 the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia formally requested a statutory levy to begin from 1 July 1992. On 21 November 1991 the Deer Farmers Council of Tasmania advised the Minister of its withdrawal from the national organisation.

         Since then there has been that conflict, letter writing campaign and so forth. However, of recent days strong support for the proposal has emerged. For example, the Victorian Deer Farmers Association—and Victoria has the biggest number of deer breeders in the Commonwealth—at its meeting on 19 March passed a vote by 59 to 2 in favour of all of the levies. Also, at an earlier time, in February 1991, at a special meeting of over 200 deer breeders, it supported the proposal. At the same time, 20 March, Mr John Andrews, the President of the New South Wales association, also confirmed that the New South Wales industry supported the proposal and rejected comments by the Junior Vice-President of that association. The Australian Fallow Deer Society Inc. at the same time indicated that it had over 50 per cent of the national herd. It gave strong support in a letter of 19 March from its President, John Holder. On the same day the Red Deer Society of Australia, the second largest of the three commercial deer varieties, also gave strong support. It made the point that as its deer produce all of the leviable products—venison, velvet and export livestock—it will be the largest contributor. Therefore, there is that support there also. Overall I believe that there has been stronger support for the proposal here than has been the case with many other industries and therefore the proposal should be supported. I do hope that the two problems I referred to earlier can be solved.

         The first of those concerns Tasmania, which constitutes 8 per cent of the industry. It withdrew from the association because it had been critical of the deer industry development group, which is a deer advisory body to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. The point has been made by none other than the Minister for Primary Industry in Tasmania, Mr Robin Gray, that that State feels that it has an adequate State development arrangement for the industry, and there is a request to delay the Bill to allow time for more discussions. The industry does recognise that it has a challenge to bring the Tasmanians back into the fold. I understand that they have been invited to the next annual general meeting of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia this month, and hopefully that will be accepted by them. At that meeting there will be a review of the membership of the deer industry development group.

         The second problem mentioned in the correspondence and in the phone calls received is this potential problem of double charging or double levies, namely, a levy both on an animal with regard to, say, velvet and as a live export. I believe that this is a matter of misunderstanding. I do ask the Minister to clarify the situation about double levying. There should not be any, and I anticipate there is no need for there to be any. That would then remove one of the criticisms that have been apparent from some of the dissidents.

My understanding is that this matter will be referred briefly to a Senate committee, which will provide some opportunity to further clarify the situation and encourage negotiations between the sections of the industry. This should not be used as any reason to basically delay or impede the legislation. Therefore, the coalition supports the legislation and commends the industry for making that very important step to be part of the overall rural industries research and development arrangements.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill forms part of a package of five Bills to institute levies and charges on the deer industry in order to fund a research and development program. As the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said, it is pleasing to see so many smaller, newer and, one may say, exotic primary industries come into line with the larger primary industries in regard to research and development, which is the key for the future. It is the case, as the honourable member for Murray says, that agriculture is going to be one of the sunrise industries. It certainly does lead the way in many aspects in regard to the recognition of research and development. The proposed levies and charges have been requested by the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia which represents the majority of deer farmers in Australia. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on the slaughter of deer in Australia.

         There are four other Bills in this package. Three provide for a charge on the export of deer produced in Australia, a levy on the sale of deer velvet produced and sold in Australia or used in the production of other goods in Australia and a charge on the export of deer velvet produced in Australia. The fifth Bill in this package makes provision for consequential amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991.

         As I said, it is good to see so many innovative industries. I fully concur with the honourable member for Murray in regard to kangaroos. There is a massive potential there to utilise and farm a natural resource. As technology improves, we will be able to do that. It does make sense to value add in regard to kangaroos. In my area emus and ostriches are now being introduced and farmed because of their potential. Marron, fibre goats and fresh water fish are also now coming to the fore. It was pleasing to see the goat fibre levy Bills come through—I think it was only last year or the year before—as well as the course grains legislation which came through last week.

         As the honourable member for Murray also said—in fact, he has clearly covered the major background to this Bill—there are approximately 1,000 deer farmers in Australia with something like 155,000 to 160,000 deer. The majority—something like half—do reside in Victoria. I guess that, while we in Queensland do have the best climate in the world, it is not as conducive to deer breeding as is the climate in the southern States. So I guess we do have to let the south have some industries to itself.

         The Deer Farmers Federation of Australia is the sole industry representative organisation, other than specific breed—that is, fallow, red, or rusa—societies. It has about 550 members, which is a high percentage of farms in comparison with any rural industry. At a deer industry workshop in 1989, which was sponsored by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, the research priorities for the industry were considered and it was decided that, although farm based production research was important, it was not the priority.

         The RIRDC, in consultation with the DFFA, commissioned Australian Agricultural Consulting and Marketing Co. Pty Ltd to conduct a deer marketing and production study, the results of which were released in June 1991. The study looked at the strategic priorities for research into the production, marketing and processing aspects of the deer industry. At an annual general meeting of the DFFA held on 22 March 1991, the following resolution was passed unanimously:

         At an open meeting of the DFFA in August 1991, which was attended by approximately 300 people, the meeting voted unanimously for a voluntary levy on deer slaughterings and on deer numbers behind wire to raise revenue for the RIRDC until the statutory levy was available. On 23 September 1991 the managing director of the RIRDC wrote to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) informing him that the RIRDC and the DFFA had reached an agreement whereby the RIRDC had offered to finance an industry development program up to $200,000 for each of the next three years, dependent upon an industry commitment of at least $1 for each $2 from the RIRDC in 1990-91 and rising to dollar for dollar in 1993-94.

         At least two-thirds of available funds in the first year are to be directed to market development activity. The focus will be on product standards adding value to the product and extension and training on the use of the products, especially venison. Good links with the food services sector are being developed and product handling, user information and training packages are expected to be key components of the market development project. The program is not expected to include product advertising and the Corporation considers there would be diseconomies in trying to separate the research, development and promotional elements for such a small industry at this stage.

        The Minister replied to that letter, indicating that the proposed statutory levies were going to replace the existing voluntary levy arrangements and would be a more equitable arrangement; that there is no power under the Constitution to grant exemption to a State from a Commonwealth charge, levy or excise, and nor should there be; that Tasmanians cannot isolate themselves from developments in the industry, particularly as the mainland States already form a significant market for that State's deer and deer products; and that it is clear that it is the will of the majority of the deer industry to have statutory levy arrangements introduced and that the Minister would be introducing legislation to give effect to such. The Minister recommended that the Deer Farmers Council of Tasmania should have further discussions with the DFFA and RIRDC to resolve the differences.

         The Tasmanian concerns are not unanimous, as four producers are contributing to a voluntary levy on deer slaughterings and deer behind wire until statutory levy arrangements are in place. Further, the Fallow Deer Society and the Red Deer Society—which represent deer breeds that account for 90 per cent of deer in Australia and which include Tasmanian members—have endorsed the full levy package.

         During the drafting of the deer industry legislation, a number of potential loopholes were identified which also had the potential of undermining the levy base. At a telephone conference of the DFFA and State delegates in February 1992, there was unanimous support for an export charge on deer velvet and live deer. This was subsequently conveyed to the Minister. The conference stated that, contrary to some misconceptions in the deer industry, the proposed deer velvet export charge would be imposed only in cases when, at the time of export, velvet had not been previously sold and therefore was not subject to levy under the proposed velvet sale levy. It stated that, prior to 1992, there had been only small ad hoc shipments of live deer. However—and it is good news—the prospect of an expanding live deer export market to Korea would divert deer from slaughter and seriously undermine the deer slaughter levy base.

         I agree with the honourable member for Murray: it would be good if it were possible for the Tasmanian industry to see the commonsense of coming into line and being part of the whole industry. I think that will happen over time. We have seen in almost all other cases concerning research and development that, even if there has been some small amount of disagreement initially, people have seen the advantage of a unified approach to research and development. We are one nation; one country. Whether it be Tasmania, Victoria or Queensland, R&amp;D is equally important to the whole industry.

         As previous speakers have indicated, the legislation will establish a deer industry research development fund through industry levies and government contributions. I think it would be unnecessarily repetitious for me to retrace the already detailed history of the industry given by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) and the background to the legislation which has already been covered more than adequately by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd).

         I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in the magnanimous way for which you are well known, you will forgive me if I pause now to observe that this legislation will give the facilities so that levies can in fact be charged against the industry to raise the dough needed for research and development in the industry. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) will be aware, the funding is required to buck up the industry, because without this sort of legislation there is a real danger that it may stagnate. I know that the industry did not go fawning to the Minister in order to have this legislation passed, but in fact indicated that it thought the participation in those sorts of research and development arrangements which already exist for other industries would be a good idea. I do not want to be frivolous about the legislation.

         —No, I genuinely do not want to be frivolous about the legislation because, as has been pointed out by previous speakers, this is an industry of which Australia ought to be proud. The Australian deer population has been expanding by 25 per cent a year. It is currently estimated that there are 1,000 farms carrying something like 155,000 deer. These figures have been largely derived from the industry itself and not from the normal sources applying to primary industry, such as ABARE.

         This is a sunrise industry, and much of the innovation and much of the adventurous approach to new industries that characterise Australian agriculture can be seen in the development of the Australian deer industry. The significance of this legislation and this opportunity to raise funds through these Bills is pronounced when one considers that until now the deer breeders have been receiving funds through the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation which is financed by the Government through the special rural research fund and voluntary levies. In order to raise sufficient funds to implement an effective research and development program, the industry has chosen this statutory levy on all producers.

         I think it is a credit to the enthusiasm that deer producers have for their industry that they have chosen to take this particular course, as has been clearly outlined by the honourable member for Murray. A measure of the commitment that the industry has to research and development can be gleaned simply by comparing the figure that has been raised as a result of the voluntary levies, which was about $25,000 last year, with the money that is anticipated as a result of the statutory levy, which will be in the vicinity of $100,000 in 1992-93. That $100,000 provides a real opportunity for the deer industry to be involved in the sort of research and development that characterises primary industries around Australia. As previous speakers have indicated, the legislation before the House will set an operative rate of 18c a kilogram on a hot dressed carcass with a maximum rate of 30c on venison, an operative rate of $10 a head of live deer exported and a maximum rate of $20 a head, and a 5 per cent operative rate on velvet, where there will also be a maximum rate of 7 per cent.

         As I said in my opening remarks, I do not think I should delay the House by running through the history of the industry, but may I bring in a synopsis of the industry by pointing out to the House that deer were introduced into Australia in the early nineteenth century from Europe, Asia and North America. As we now know, there are fallow deer, which make up the majority of farmed deer, and red deer, which represent the largest number of deer currently being farmed in Queensland. Of the venison currently being produced on Australian deer farms, much of it is consumed locally, and that consumption meets about a third of the Australian demand. The remainder of the venison to meet the demand in Australia is imported from New Zealand.

         Under the operation of CER, Australian venison producers are finding themselves under some pressure from New Zealand producers. In fact, the collapse of communism in eastern Europe has meant that the once lucrative West German market, which was open to New Zealand producers, has now been largely minimised. As a result of that, the New Zealanders, having been denied the West German market or portions thereof, are looking for alternative markets and, increasingly, making venison available to Australia. This puts real pressure on Australia's venison producers.

         There is something of an irony there in that, in an electorate such as mine, a large number of the venison producers are in areas that were formerly used for dairy farms. The very problems that the dairy farmers faced are now being faced by the venison producers with the competition that they have to contend with from across the Tasman.

         We might tonight ask ourselves the question: why does New Zealand succeed and Australia fail in this sort of competitive exercise? It is fair to make three brief observations. First, it is fair to say that the New Zealanders have been much more market oriented than we have in the past and in a number of areas—Kiwi fruit is a classic one—we have actually seen the New Zealanders as quite aggressive marketers and they have become a role model for Australians.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But it is also fair to make two other observations. The cost of production has fallen in New Zealand—despite popular opinion, largely as a result of its industrial relations and transport reform, and as a result of the adoption of a GST there, an adoption which has been endorsed by the New Zealand Farmers Federation. So we might confidently expect that a tax which reduces the tax burden borne by producers could advantage Australian producers just as it has advantaged New Zealand producers.

         It is true that the deer industry in Australia but three or four years ago was an industry going through a great deal of speculation. Stock was coming in from New Zealand that was expensive. It was being bought up by Australian producers who thought they saw in this stock an opportunity to raise the profile and the genetic material available in the Australian industry. In fact, that balloon burst and, in many ways, unkind though that has been to deer producers, that has been a good thing because some of the ridiculous speculation that existed in the industry has now evaporated and we find the industry now focusing on what is an economically viable and sensible course open to it. That only highlights the need for effective research and development in the Australian deer industry if we are not only going to match our New Zealand counterparts but also preferably outperform them with Australian innovation, Australian adventure and the enthusiasm that Australians have for new product.

         This debate tonight is valuable, not because there is any controversy in the House but because it focuses attention on an industry which has been largely ignored by the rest of Australia. As previous speakers have said, we have a great deal to be excited about in terms of sunrise industries in Australian agriculture and horticulture. Even in the traditional Australian wheat and wool industries new enterprises are being developed which make them the sorts of places where people may well want to place some risk capital. We will see that, no doubt, on Thursday in the National Wool Day display that is going to be held here in Parliament House. It is not only in the wheat and wool industries but also in horticulture, meat marketing, the ostrich industry and all the others named by previous speakers where we see the opportunity for sunrise industry resulting from Australian innovation in agriculture.

         I am going to make an admission—which is somewhat rare for a politician—and tell honourable members here and now that I am no expert on deer farming matters, so I will not try to dazzle them with science; I will just sum up this legislation in simple terms.

We are imposing these levies and charges for the development of a program for one reason only. The reason—as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), who is at the table, has just advised me—is that the industry requested the very thing that we are providing.

         I have about 10 minutes, so I will not take too long on the machinery parts of the Bills. I will, however, make some references to the deer farming operations in my electorate of Hunter. In 1986 I had the pleasure of accompanying the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, when he officially opened the first abattoir to process deer meat in Australia. The abattoir, Mirrabooka Meats, is owned and operated by Mr Michael Scarfe. In the early years of operation of the abattoir, Michael Scarfe suffered the ups and downs that seem to abound when one is trying to get a new industry established. But I would like to think that the worst is now behind Michael.

         The recession, of course, has affected Mirrabooka Meats, but Michael Scarfe remains confident of the future and is very supportive of the Bills now being debated. Michael is in favour of the legislation because he believes that it is the only way that the deer industry will have a voice in Federal Parliament. He is delighted to have the support of the Government in its agreeing to the recommendations made by the industry. `We are going about it in the right way', said Michael Scarfe. `It is the only fair way the industry is going to support itself and be supported by the Government'.

         Michael commented that the legislation widely covers what is needed in the industry. For too long the industry has been fragmented, trying to go it alone and not realising its full potential. In Michael Scarfe's words, the industry not only needs to support itself but also needs the support of the government body to stop illegal slaughtering and similar styles of operation.

         Mr Scarfe strongly concurs with the statement of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy that the deer industry is emerging as another facet of the rural industry with enormous potential to broaden the base of agriculture. Mr Scarfe's only concern, of course, is New Zealand competition. It is hard to compete with New Zealand when that country has a herd of 1.2 million deer behind wire and Australia has only 155,000. This affects the cost of the end product and is the reason why venison is more highly priced than other meats, Mr Scarfe told me.

         Mr Scarfe is also very pleased that legislation will provide for a professional approach to be taken to the production, slaughter and promotion of deer meat. As he says, because of its extremely low fat content it should be promoted as a health food. However, it is true to say that to date there has been little promotion of venison and it appears only rarely on restaurant menus. Anyone who has tasted venison steaks or venison sausages will know that it is a delicious alternative to other meats.

Deer farming is very capital intensive. Not only are the animals themselves very expensive to buy, but the intensive use of high wire fencing, pasture improvement, veterinary charges and so on is very costly. Therefore, the deer farmer, like any other farmer, has to get the best return for his or her outlays and endeavours.

It gives a good outline of the difficulties being faced by Mr Holder. The reason for the difficulties which all deer farmers in Australia face is that the New Zealand industry has several advantages: the number of deer compared with what we have in Australia, and the fact that New Zealanders eat 400 tonnes of venison each year, whereas our much larger population in Australia eats the same quantity of venison. As well, up to 65 per cent of the venison consumed in Australia is venison which is imported from New Zealand.

The New Zealand industry has actually gone out and promoted its meat as being low in fat with virtually no cholesterol, and it has conveyed the message that venison has tremendous potential as a health food.

         —Tonight I would like to pay tribute to Professor Friedrich August von Hayek, one of the greatest individuals of the twentieth century, who died on Tuesday, 24 March at the grand age of 92. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) and Senator Kemp have already alerted the Parliament to his passing. Professor von Hayek, along with Dr Ludwig von Mises, was one of the great economists and political philosophers of the Austrian school who took forward and refined to an exact degree the earlier works of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill and others. In doing so, they established in concrete for time immemorial the absolute principles of free market capitalism. The contribution of people such as von Hayek cannot be judged too highly.

         The latter day disciples, such as the Americans, Henry Hazlitt and Milton Friedman, owed their all to the pioneering courage and thoroughness of the Austrians. I say `courage' because people such as von Hayek stood largely alone for long periods against the rest of the world throughout some of its most difficult history. Von Hayek established with incredible clarity that undeniable link between personal liberty and economic freedom. He demonstrated that we cannot ever have the former, unless we also have the latter. Any serious student of economics, politics or philosophy who has not given adequate time and consideration to understanding this link will always have a yawning gap in his education. Regrettably, the simple lesson of that link has tragically been ignored numerous times throughout history, including the history of the twentieth century. This has resulted in the suppression and death of many millions of people with the misery endured in recent decades, by the peoples of eastern Europe being the classic example.

         Von Hayek warned not only of the evils of communism, socialism, fascism and, indeed, all forms of totalitarianism, but also of the `softer' forms of socialism that were manifesting themselves at the time in countries such as Sweden and Britain. His book
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         published in 1944 informed many, for the first time, of the ultimate evils of interventionism in government, however well-intentioned such intervention might be at the time. Whether it be communism in Russia, Keynesianism in Britain or even the accord in Australia, there is an indelible message in von Hayek's writing that we ignore at our peril. `Those who ignore history are condemned to repeat it' is a most apt saying in this regard.

         Friedrich von Hayek was born in Vienna in 1899 and became a naturalised British citizen in 1938 during Hitler's rise to power. He had published more than 25 books and some 250 papers and shared the Nobel Prize for economics in 1974. Australia was honoured with a visit by von Hayek in 1976. I well recall the impressive performance he gave on the television program

         It is somehow fitting that, on the day of his death, the last of Europe's communist dictatorships, Albania, finally embraced democracy. Let us hope that the communism and totalitarianism that still clings on in China, Cuba and other parts of the world can be largely swept aside before this century is out. If that happens, it is something that Friedrich von Hayek not only would have approved of, but would have predicted. Long live the ideas that he developed, believed in and shared with us. The world has lost one of its greatest scholars.

Australian shearers have come to Parliament House to highlight to politicians and to the general public the plight of Australian shearers. Today, more than 50 per cent of Australian shearers are out of work.

         I believe that New Zealanders should have work visas. In that way we would control the industries that they go into. If there already is unemployment in Australia in a particular industry, as there is in the shearing industry, commonsense and logic must surely dictate that work visas should be issued. In that way a quota system can be implemented and the work loads regulated. As there is no requirement for visiting New Zealanders to acquire visas or work permits, which is required of any other visitor to Australia, this unregulated, open access policy is leaving the shearing industry and other industries open to abuse by visitors from New Zealand.

I think the argument will be used that it is because of the unemployment situation in Australia. I do not want to get into a debate on migration, but I make the point that up to 150,000 Australian jobs are being filled by New Zealanders in the shearing industry, the hospitality industry, the construction industry, as well as others.

         I admit that things are tough in New Zealand, but too many Kiwis are packing their bags for Oz, as is illustrated in an advertisement in a New Zealand paper. Surely our first duty is to protect employment in Australia. The wool industry is important to us, as are Australian jobs. Even if only as a temporary measure, I believe that work permits for New Zealand shearers should be introduced and those who are here must abide by the award. It would be a tragedy and a disgrace if the wool industry, of which most Australians are proud, were totally dependent on New Zealand shearers.

         Major multinational grain traders operating in Australia have recently begun a campaign against the Australian Wheat Board's monopoly under the guise of the Australian Grain Exporters Association, the AGEA. Ironically, the AGEA's eight members include subsidiaries of North American and European traders, namely, Continental Grain, Cargill, ConAgra Inc. and Louis Dreyfus Ltd. There is absolutely nothing Australian about this group whatsoever. Replacing the Australian Wheat Board with such organisations would not be in the interests of the Australian wheat grower.

Taiwan is expected to buy 50,000 tonnes of grain from Australia this year. Foreign grain companies would not have bothered putting in this effort on behalf of the Australian wheat grower. Instead, private grain traders would have simply shipped wheat from other sources—in many cases, subsidised sources.

The Australian Wheat Board has maintained this position against all odds; that is, against the escalating subsidy war of the European Community and the United States of America.

         In excess of 80 per cent of annual world wheat trade goes to markets which have single-desk buyers, including Japan, China, Egypt, Iraq, Iran and the Federation of Russian States. A single-desk seller in these circumstances is more strongly placed to hold its negotiating position. The majority of our competitors have the benefit of a 100 per cent Government guarantee on credit sales. Further, the Australian Wheat Board cover for sales through the Export Finance Insurance Corporation is usually around 80 per cent. Only in Australia is the residual risk borne by the growers.

         The Australian Wheat Board has for 60 years looked after the interests of the Australian wheat farmer. The domestic market, which accounts for about three million tonnes or more than 20 per cent of the average harvest, is now totally deregulated. The Australian Wheat Board separates wheat into 40 classes based on protein levels and other qualities, and pays farmers accordingly. Massive savings have been passed on to growers through port and rail reforms initiated and followed through by the Australian Wheat Board. Growers are guaranteed payment within 21 days of delivery. The Australian Wheat Board does not shy from marketing efforts in more difficult countries, as the Taiwanese example illustrates.

I know that it is not in the interests of any of the Australian farmers, either, to be supporting a situation in which Australian workers are being denied work and well-trained people are being kept out of work, and at the same time there is a tax rort going on.

         I also want to mention another matter. Towards the end of last year in Geraldton in Western Australia I opened the Community Legal Service Centre. The Community Legal Service Centre has a staff of a full time solicitor, a full time legal secretary, a full time financial counsellor and a full time coordinator and child support adviser. The Community Legal Service

         entre is designed to provide legal advice, effectively, and legal support to people on low incomes. The difficulty that that centre has had is that it has been opposed, and to some extent given an embargo, by three people in the town of Geraldton—a Mr Duncan Armstrong, a Mr George Giudice and a Mr Robert Glenn—who have been trying to make life very difficult for the centre. I represented Senator Michael Tate, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, in opening the centre.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other thing that concerns me is that not only have these people opposed the establishment of this centre, which breaks the legal stranglehold that they had over the availability of legal services in the town; but, further to that, they have also been attacking a lawyer with the Aboriginal Legal Service, a Mr Terry Malone. They have, in effect, been quite political about it because they persuaded Mr Eric Charlton, the National Party shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, to claim that Mr Malone is not doing his work because he is engaging in outside practice.

         I just want to put the record straight on this: Mr Malone was given the right of private practice because at the time he went there the only way that the Aboriginal Legal Service could retain someone of his stature was to allow him to supplement his income. This was an arrangement entered into quite properly and quite freely. Similar arrangements are entered into in Queensland with the Aboriginal Legal Service. So in effect the Aboriginal Legal Service and the Community Legal Service Centre in Geraldton have had Mr Malone working particularly for them. Also, additionally, he has been able, quite properly, to make extra income. I might point out that the Aboriginals themselves have not complained about this. In fact, they rather take some pride in the fact that Mr Malone is not an inferior lawyer but one who is able to make his mark in the community at large.

         I have been concerned about that because more recently there was a case involving a Mr Ken Dan, a young Aboriginal who was arrested by a policeman for wearing a pair of surfer's sunglasses. Unfortunately, the policeman at the time did not understand that Ken Dan is a very successful surfer in Western Australia, be it that he is Aboriginal. The reason he had the pair of sunglasses was that it was one of those things that people like him are often offered as a result of their success in surfing. Had it not been for Mr Malone and the Aboriginal Legal Service, Mr Dan would not have been properly represented. I will not comment further on the outcome of the trial—that would not be proper—except to say that Mr Dan won the case and was properly represented by Mr Malone.

There is nothing wrong with his taking outside practice, and I believe that the town of Geraldton is better served by having proper legal representation. I appreciate the opportunity to put this on the record in the House tonight.

         Mr Fami, the new owner, purchased the works in 1991 on the basis that he wanted to introduce some new work practices, get more productivity, make a change to the infamous tally system and introduce contract labour. On that basis he employed Troubleshooters, which was able to provide contract labour to work efficiently, get paid for the work that they did and, in fact, work five days a week, which is not always the norm in the meat industry, to get the tasks done. Mr Fami was following the example at Wodonga, where McPhee's had 82 days of strike which cost $3m, but at the end of that they were able to employ contract meatworkers. There are now 325 jobs at that works and a 40 per cent improvement in productivity. Just think about it—a 40 per cent improvement in productivity by those contract workers. That is a far cry from what was suggested at Camperdown.

         The Camperdown owner wanted to repeat the exercise down there, but, of course, the AMIEU set up a picket line, so much so that to get to the job, the contract workers had to travel in a furniture van, leaving at 7 a.m. and protected by a police force of between 40 and 80 men, along with police horses. The picket line was pretty rough; there was intimidation of the contract workers and standover tactics were adopted. All that is on the public record. Does the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) really defend the tactics of those picketers on that line during these fairly tough times? The town of Camperdown was divided and there were abusive telephone calls.

         This matter has been raised in this Parliament and also in the Victorian Parliament, where there has been false information and misrepresentation of the situation. The farmers have not been able to process their cattle, 40 jobs have not been created and, of course, the 170 jobs that used to be there are no longer available. The works are closed and the basic reasons are the outdated industrial relations practices going back to the nineteenth century, the luddite attitude of Secretary Wally Curran and also, of course, the leniency of the courts in interpreting the picket line situation.

         . At the moment they are distributing information around Australia, trying to tell people that they are all going to be better off by having a 15 per cent tax imposed on the food they put in their mouths, on the clothes they put on their backs, on the shoes they put on their feet and on the fruit and vegetables they buy. The Opposition is saying to everybody, `Don't you worry about that; you are all going to finish up with more money in your pocket'. But when Treasury does the analysis and we get a detailed examination, we find beyond doubt that 70 per cent of households of full time wage and salary earners and about 60 per cent of self-employed and farmer households will be worse off. That is indisputable fact.

         Then we find the truth is exposed about this document. The imposition of a 15 per cent tax on all those goods and services that are not taxable is about shifting the tax burden from the higher income groups down the line to the lower income groups. It is the old ideology; back to the old class society—it is as simple as that.

        (a) The Agreement between the Commonwealth and Westpac provides that an entitled applicant and/or a borrower would pay no other fees and no more in fees with respect to applications for DSH benefits than the Bank's other housing loan customers. There has been no change to the Agreement between the Commonwealth and Westpac since it was passed by the Parliament in December 1988.

        There is no specific reference in the Agreement to charging of legal fees directly to a DSH loan account. However, it is standard banking practice to charge legal fees such as those associated with exercising the Bank's power of sale as mortgagee to a person's loan account, regardless of whether it is a DSH loan account. This was also the practice by the Defence Service Homes Corporation prior to the sale to Westpac.

        (b) The Agreement provides that monthly repayments are calculated to ensure that each interest rate component of the loan is repaid at the same time (that is, if only the scheduled repayment is made each month, at the end of the term of the loan).

        Under the present arrangements any excess payment is apportioned to each of the various interest rate components. For example, if the balance of the loan for one of the interest rates represents 25% of the total loan, then 25% of the excess payment would be deducted from this interest rate component. Each interest rate component is treated in the same way.

        In relation to (a)—except for drugs which need authority prescriptions under the PBS (Tarcil is the only one in part (1)), prescriptions do not normally include the indications for which the drugs are being prescribed. The Department of Health, Housing and Community Services thus holds no information which would enable a complete answer to this question.

        However, doctors often prescribe drugs for use outside of the approved indications and thus the approved indications will not be a complete list of the indications for which the drugs are actually being used in Australia.

        Concerning part (b)—as I am unable to give a complete and comprehensive answer to (a), it follows that a similar situation applies to (b). However, even to list all of the approved indications for all of the drugs in (1) and then give all other drugs listed on the PBS which could be used for any of those indications would be a considerable task. Current resources are not available for such a task.

        Labour productivity is not a complete measure of efficiency. There can be good reasons for variation among ports. For example, different loader capacities, different demand patterns and different coal receival technologies can affect labour productivities. However, other measures of efficiency are not easy to establish.

        The Bureau has not included a study of coal loader efficiency in its current work program. There are two reasons for this. First, the Queensland Mining Council advised the Bureau that its members had not reported any problems with efficiency in Queensland coal loader operations. Secondly, labour productivities of New South Wales coal loaders more than doubled between 1989-90 and 1990-91.

        In view of the absence of perceived problems with Queensland coal loaders and the substantial improvements in labour productivity achieved by New South Wales coal loaders, there does not appear to be any current need for a Bureau coal loader study.

        (3) (a) The full White Paper program included a large number of individual initiatives. Some had significant facilities and operational implications (such as the basing of a brigade sized force in the north) and others involved major capital investment in new equipment. I do not wish to comment in detail on the proposed forward acquisition program, both to avoid raising expectations unduly, and to maintain commercial competitiveness. Nor would it be practicable to list all of the detailed changes which have been made. The more significant changes however, include deferral of a decision on the construction of a third over-the-horizon radar until later in this decade, cancellation of the inshore minehunter program in favour of the acquisition of coastal minehunters of proven design, cancellation of acquisition of a craft of opportunity minesweeping core force, and deferral of acquisition of a second company group lift of Blackhawk helicopters for Army.
