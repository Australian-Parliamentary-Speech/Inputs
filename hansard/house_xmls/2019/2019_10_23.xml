                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is entirely reasonable for Australians to therefore expect that the government has appropriate systems in place to detect instances of Medicare noncompliance and treatment pathways proportionate to the type of noncompliance detected. This will ensure that every taxpayer dollar of our precious healthcare spend is directed to clinically necessary services for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Commonwealth has sophisticated detection techniques at its disposal, current legislative restrictions are impairing the effective and efficient detection of some cases of Medicare fraud and noncompliance. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Healthcare services provided through Medicare and the Department of Veterans' Affairs were funded by taxpayers to the tune of over $36 billion in 2017-18. The integrity of these programs must be ensured so that Australians can continue to access high-quality, effective health treatments. Every dollar wasted by fraud is a dollar that the government cannot invest in cutting-edge new treatments, like CAR-T therapies for people with blood cancer.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will permit data matching across the MBS and PBS for Medicare compliance purposes. This will enable, for example, the identification of instances where the Commonwealth pays for a PBS medicine that is not actually supplied.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides for data matching between the Department of Health and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency to ensure that restrictions placed on registered healthcare providers by their professional board are adhered to in Medicare claiming.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill supports matching of data from Medicare and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to ensure that services provided under both programs are considered for the purposes of the prescribed pattern of services, where exceeding a certain number of services on a certain number of days may be considered inappropriate practice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Data matching with records held by the Department of Home Affairs that indicate whether a person is overseas will allow confirmation that both the healthcare provider and patient were in Australia at the time of their claimed services. Believe it or not, we have actually found instances of fraudulent Medicare billing where either the doctor or the patient for a service billed to Medicare was actually out of the country when the service was supposed to have been provided.</span>
                </p>

I would also like to thank the opposition for their constructive engagement and involvement. Those groups, as I mentioned earlier, that have contributed include the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government's first responsibility is to keep Australians safe and secure, and this includes protecting Australians from transnational, serious and organised crime. That is why I today introduce the Transport Security Amendment (Serious Crime) Bill 2019,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>to ensure that security-sensitive areas at Australia's airports, seaports and offshore facilities are not accessible by serious criminals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Serious and organised crime is a major threat to the Australian way of life. It causes enormous human suffering and is estimated by the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission to cost the Australian economy more than $47 billion per annum. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Airports and seaports are transit points for organised criminals to import weapons, illicit drugs and other harmful goods into Australia. Trafficking of these illicit goods puts Australia's security and prosperity, and the welfare of our communities, at great risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2015 National Ice Taskforce and the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Law Enforcement have both recommended that Australia's aviation and maritime environments be hardened against these risks by strengthening the eligibility criteria under the aviation and maritime security identification card schemes (ASIC and MSIC schemes). This bill delivers on this recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ASIC and MSIC schemes are essential in ensuring security within Australia's transport network. Persons who hold an ASIC or MSIC card are able to access the most secure areas of Australia's airports and seaports. To attain an ASIC or MSIC card, a background check is required. However, at present, the background check only determines whether a person may be a threat to aviation or maritime security. It does not consider whether the person has a history of involvement in serious crime. This leaves our airports and seaports vulnerable to exploitation by serious criminals. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) has identified that almost 300 ASIC or MSIC card holders have known criminal links to organised motorcycle gangs and other serious and organised crime groups on the ACIC's National Criminal Target List.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIC and MSIC card holders can abuse their privileged position for criminal purposes, and card holders are able to assist crime syndicates by facilitating the transit of illicit goods through our transport networks and border controls. For example, a Sydney airport baggage handler is currently before the courts charged with using his trusted position to bypass customs processes. The handler was part of an alleged trafficking syndicate, and he is alleged to have used his airside access to transit large amounts of cocaine undetected through border control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will address such criminality at our airports and seaports by broadening the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 beyond their present focus on security to include provisions aimed at addressing crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill establishes a regulatory framework for introducing new eligibility criteria to address the existing vulnerability across both schemes and to ensure that persons convicted of serious offences will be ineligible to hold an ASIC or MSIC card. In addition, the bill will strengthen the regulatory framework by harmonising the eligibility criteria under each scheme. These changes will reduce the ability of criminals to exploit Australia's aviation and maritime networks for illicit gain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the Australian government is committed to improving safety and security outcomes for all Australians. The ASIC and MSIC card schemes are an important part of securing the aviation and maritime sectors. Any person with an operational need to access a security-sensitive area at an airport or seaport should be of proper character. This bill will ensure that this is the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms presented in this bill were reviewed by the Senate Standing Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee during the previous term of parliament, and the committee recommended that they be passed without amendment. The imperative for this legislation is clear. It will reduce the ability of organised crime groups to engage in illegal activities at airports and seaports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements measures announced in the government's 2017-18 budget housing affordability package to improve housing affordability, encourage investment in affordable rental housing and to improve the integrity of our tax system. These measures support those already legislated as part of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Act 2017 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Act 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 to this bill implements stronger rules for foreign residents owning Australian housing to reduce pressure on housing affordability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, foreign residents will be denied access to the main residence capital gains tax (CGT) exemption from 7.30 pm Australian Eastern Standard Time on 9 May 2017 except in the case of certain life events that occur within six years of losing their Australian residency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A grandfathering arrangement will apply for properties already held at that time, with the change taking effect for these properties from 1 July 2020. This will provide foreign residents sufficient time to consider and to plan their affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will also allow foreign residents to continue to access the main residence exemption within six years of becoming a foreign resident if a CGT event occurs to their Australian property and during that period they experience certain life events—their death, or divorce (and equivalent) or terminal illness, or the death or terminal illness of their spouse, or child who is under 18 years old.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, this schedule addresses an integrity issue with the CGT rules for foreign residents that hold indirect interests in Australian real property, such as land, from 7.30 pm Australian Eastern Standard Time on 9 May 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This reform addresses an integrity issue with the principal asset test to require a foreign resident to consider any interests held by its associates, if it disposes of an indirect interest in Australian real property for example by selling shares in a land rich company.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This ensures the principal asset test cannot be circumvented by disaggregating holdings of membership interests.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These foreign resident CGT changes, together with the 2017 expansion of the foreign resident CGT withholding regime, are expected to have a gain to revenue of $510.0 million over the forward estimates period to 2020-21. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 to this bill delivers on the government's commitment to introduce tax incentives to boost investment in affordable housing, to create the right incentives and to improve outcomes for those in need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill allows resident investors in qualifying affordable rental housing to obtain a CGT discount of up to 60 per cent from 1 January 2018. Under current arrangements, individuals generally receive a 50 per cent capital gains discount for CGT assets held for at least 12 months. This includes residential investment properties that are supplied for affordable housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The additional CGT discount will be available to resident investors who hold affordable housing directly or through certain trusts, such as holding units within a managed investment trust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To qualify for the additional discount, the affordable housing must be held for a period of at least three years from the start date of this measure, and be managed through a registered community housing provider in accordance with state and territory housing policies and registration requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure encourages increased investment in affordable rental housing and forms part of the government's housing affordability package announced in the 2017-18 budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure is estimated to have a cost to revenue of $15.0 million to 2020-21.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of this bill is a technical amendment that introduces a reconciliation payment for the near-new dwelling exemption certificate that has already been introduced through regulation changes on 24 June 2017. This change supports the streamlined foreign investment framework announced in the 2017-18 budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment provides the mechanism for imposing a fee on the developer for each near-new dwelling sale to foreign persons.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the government through this bill is creating the right incentives as part of our comprehensive and targeted plan to improve outcomes across the housing spectrum.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Public Works Committee has recently reported to both houses of parliament, as required by the Public Works Committee Act 1969, on its inquiry into the proposed fit-out of new, purpose-built premises to be leased by the Australian Federal Police at 140 Lonsdale Street, Melbourne. The new lease arises as a result of the expiry of the AFP's current office lease at 383 La Trobe Street, Melbourne. The committee did not identify any issues of concern with the proposal and is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of needs, scope and cost. The committee has reported that, having regard to its role and responsibilities, the committee is of the view that this project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project which is fit for purpose, having regard to the established need. The committee has recommended that the House resolve, pursuant to section 18 subsection 7 of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the work. On behalf of the government I thank the committee for again undertaking a timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is anticipated to commence in late 2019 and be completed by late 2022. I therefore commend the motion to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:58</span>):  To continue my remarks from yesterday, I want to place on the record in the House of Representatives that we all know that Australia is suffering what I would say is the worst energy crisis since the mid-1970s, and it's simply not good enough for the government to not have a real energy policy after six years in government. As much as they would have you believe otherwise, this bill will not end the nation's energy crisis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Rankin's second reading amendment to this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct) Bill 2019, which I'm speaking to, highlights just how much of a failure the government is when it comes to national energy policy, noting that 'the government has proven unable to deliver sensible national energy policy to support well-functioning electricity markets that will support new clean energy investment, safeguard energy reliability and security, and deliver a modern and affordable energy system for a modern Australian economy. That really sums it up: a failure on every facet, in my opinion, when it comes to a national energy policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to place on the record today that, since 2015, gas prices have tripled and wholesale power prices across the national energy market have skyrocketed by 158 per cent, smashing household budgets and jeopardising tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of policy from the government has been cited by the Finkel review, the Energy Security Board, industry and Infrastructure Australia as driving up costs. These are the facts. This is not spin. This is not an invention. This is hard-core data which clearly shows that, under this government, for the last six years we have been paying more in energy costs than we as a nation have ever paid before. Today before the House we are debating a bill which is the 16th attempt by the government to get an energy policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Out in the real world, out in the community, people are rightly confused. Since 2013, the coalition have failed to act on climate and energy and, quite frankly, their policy record is one of abject and complete failure, summarised by rising electricity prices and rising carbon pollution. Since I've sat in the House of Representatives, when we have debates on energy policy, normally the only response the government have is some concocted imaginings or some nonsense like, 'We won't be as bad as Labor,' or 'Labor would be worse,' or 'State governments are to blame.' That's really summing up what the debate is. It's not any arguments or alternative approaches—isn't that an ironic term at the moment! They don't actually come forward with proper policy to debate this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We did have that once. There was a glimmer of hope for a little while when we saw the birth of the National Energy Guarantee. I want to be very clear: whilst it was not perfect, the NEG was a mechanism designed to ensure reliability of supply and emissions reduction in the electricity sector. The current Treasurer and then former energy minister, I thought, was sold a pup. He was given orders by the former Prime Minister to go out and sell this as a policy, and we all know how that movie ended. It was ripped apart. The member for Hughes and the climate change deniers got their hands on it, went on to <span style="font-style:italic;">Sky News After Dark </span>and ripped it apart. That chorus came down and said: 'We don't need it. It's not going to happen.' It was all destroyed—a bit like the leadership of the former member for Wentworth. It was dumped just as quickly as it was born, and that was supposed to be the answer to all our energy problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I were a member of the government, I'd be embarrassed that, when I go to the community or to schools or when I got up in front of people, they would ask: 'How are we going to fix energy prices? How are we going to reduce carbon pollution?' You'd have to say: 'Well, we'll wait and see. We're not sure. We keep coming up with things, and they keep getting knocked over. Some people like it; some people don't.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent reports show that state governments, in particular the New South Wales Liberal government, are privately talking to the government to try to work out what to do post-NEG. The Berejiklian government wants Minister Taylor to just revive the NEG, given pretty much every stakeholder in the energy sector would prefer a transparent national policy mechanism rather than the government simply picking winners. But media reports say the minister has said no. We still really don't know why the government doesn't come back to the table on real energy policy like the National Energy Guarantee, which the Prime Minister and Treasurer both said would bring down power prices by an average of $550. That was according to the government's own modelling. That's not Labor's research; that's what the government told us. If we had the National Energy Guarantee, power prices would come down by $550.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make this point: the NEG has the support of every business organisation and every state and territory government, Labor and coalition alike, and would have finally delivered the price release that Australia is desperately in need of. Australia needs real action to bring down energy prices right now, not just more talk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After all of that, we arrive at the second go of the so-called 'big stick' policy: to scare companies into lowering power prices. The other thing about this heavy market intervention is—it's amazing when you look at the speakers list today on this. Where are the free marketeers? Where are the people who champion free economies? Where are there freedom lovers wanting to defend open markets? It's eerily silent. After listening to all the first speeches of 'less government, less regulation, less red tape, less green tap' and on it goes, they're suspiciously quiet when it comes to this dare I say socialist-style, market-driven, Venezuelan, Cuban-style intervention into the marketplace. It is quite ironic to hear one side of the street talk and then see the other side watching that as it goes down. I want to be clear: this is not a plan for national energy certainty. It only leads to more chaos and confusion for industry and consumers. And that's exactly what the Australian Energy Council put forward in their Senate submission on this bill. They called on the government to alter many 'poorly drafted' parts of the proposed laws, saying it would otherwise risk more frequent price changes and leave consumers confused and frustrated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst Labor has played a constructive role, as we do, in cleaning up legislation and ensuring that the government's own homework is better, we still understand that we have an awfully long way to go when it comes to dealing with energy security in this country and, in particular, the reduction of carbon pollution.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  This coalition is a government of fakes and flakes, and this legislation proves it. There is no better example of fakes and flakes than what we're debating right now. Treasury Laws Amendment (Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct) Bill is the official title but everyone refers to it as the big-stick legislation. Outside we get the government talking tough, saying that they'll use this to break up energy companies when they don't pass on drops in energy prices. Mind you, wholesale prices in this country have leapt nearly 160 per cent largely because there's no effective policy framework in the country. Inside here, with the media and all the people who rightly go, 'Hang on, is this the right step to take?' they go, 'No, no, this is a last resort.' Outside, they're tough; in here, they're timid and they don't want, they claim, to have to use this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation comes about because this is a government that haven't got their act together on energy because they fight amongst themselves. They've not been able to come up with some sort of coherent idea about how we'll generate energy in a much cleaner, more efficient way in this country. This is the big test for the nation—to do just that, to generate energy in a cleaner, efficient way. We'll sometimes have those opposite say, 'Well, look, we believe in climate change and we believe in the need to generate energy much better,' but they've got to come up with a practical idea, and what's their idea? The idea of those opposite is: 'Well, we're going to use taxpayer funds to generate power through coal. If the energy companies can't see our sense'—the coalition's sense of generating coal-fired energy—'then we're going to break them up and fund them with taxpayer funds. We'll generate it on our own.' What is practical about that? Nothing at all is practical about that at a time when renewables are going through the roof, and the government knows most energy players are going down this path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The prime mover of reviews, the now Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, went through all these incarnations: he went with an emissions intensity target. That got dropped because the hardheads in the coalition party room didn't like anything that sounded like that. He then went to a clean energy target. That got dropped as well. And then he ended on the NEG, the National Energy Guarantee, which again, they couldn't get their heads around. At that point in time, we had the spectacle of those opposite say, 'We're only going to put the National Energy Guarantee to the floor of this parliament if we get bipartisan support,' which suggested we weren't in favour of getting a coherent, sensible energy policy in this country—garbage; absolute rubbish! Why? Because, while we agreed, as my colleague the member for Oxley just indicated, we didn't think it was perfect, we thought it was good—better than what was on offer at that moment. So when those opposite said, 'Well, we need bipartisan support,' it wasn't that they needed support from us—bipartisan, two parts; what they needed was in their own party room agreement. They had this split between the Neanderthals and the sensibles—the ones who knew that they needed to get a policy in place—but the Neanderthals said, 'We are not going to have this NEG because it sounds too green; it sounds too much like we're doing something fancy that we don't like,' and they fought amongst themselves. It wasn't bipartisan with us; it was within them. The problem with that side of politics at the moment is that they have regressed into this sort of Trumpian slump, where they just ape what they're seeing on the other side of the Pacific and they're continuing this long conflict on this policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to get this right. As I said, a 160 per cent increase in wholesale power prices means that people are getting whopping power bills in the mail, and they can't believe their eyes. Why? Because those opposite have not been able to work out how, as I said earlier, we can generate energy in a cleaner, more efficient way. And this is the classic case. This is the most commonsensical thing. If you haven't got supply, guess what? If demand is up and there is no supply then prices are going to go up and that is exactly what has happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we get this type of legislation being put to us here as some sort of suggestion that this is a serious attempt to deal with it. No, it's not. This big stick is about breaking up energy companies because they won't go against their business sense and do what the coalition wants in an ideological sense, and that is what we've got here. There's no better test, too. Outside, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, says, 'We want drops in wholesale power prices to be passed onto consumers.' If they're saying that this legislation, this big stick, will be taken to those energy companies and they will be broken up if they're not passing on drops in wholesale power prices to consumers, the test for them is this: go and use it on the banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big debate we're having in this country is that every time there's an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia, it is never passed on properly to consumers, in particular, to those people who are balancing paying off a home, while their wages aren't going up, aren't getting the hours they need at work, are doing everything they can to meet the cost of living, while power prices—mind you—are going up. If the banks won't pass on the interest rates cuts, where's the big stick? We get a lot of tough talk out of the coalition but we don't get any of this type of proposal being put out in the public space—that they'll pick up this divestiture power and put it on the banks and break up the banks. The banks are profiting massively. They're raking in billions by not passing on interest rate cuts at a time when ordinary Australians need them or the economy needs that boost to get it out of the spluttering state that it's in at the moment, where the IMF has downgraded growth four times more than most other economies, and our growth is expected to be slower than Greece. The coalition won't do that. They will not do this to banks at all—mark my words. They'll not use their so-called big stick on the banks. They will use this big stick basically to hold up a sign that says, 'fake action here', because that's what this bill is about. The coalition know they will be in a world of pain if they do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes in this weird world of politics, you have to give people what they are hankering for. If those opposite are hankering for this bit of legislation, they'll get it, and then we'll test and see what they actually do. I don't think it's necessarily a smart idea to break up these energy companies, because they know they've got these ageing coal-fired generators they're not willing to put money into, they know the game is about finding new ways to generate energy in a much cleaner, more efficient way, and that's where they want to put their money. Why would you load them up with costs that you know will get passed onto consumers at any rate? But the government wants to break those companies up. That's what the claim is outside, not in here, and the test will be: will that actually happen? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bigger test, though, is: will power prices actually come down? I reckon those opposite will not meet that test at all. This will not lead to a drop in prices and it certainly won't lead to a drop in emissions. The rest of the world is saying, 'Come on, we've got to get our act together on this and see that actually occur.' We are not going to see that whatsoever out of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're debating this legislation. If they want this legislation, they're going to get it. We're going to see if they actually deliver—deliver not more hot air, not more slogans, not more political stunts, but deliver results for ordinary people who want to see a drop in their power prices and who expect us to take the issue of climate change seriously and to do the things that will reduce emissions in the longer term for the benefit of the nation. That's what we expect to see. That is the challenge. That is the real test of whether governments in this country will take this seriously, will recognise the challenge that we've got before us, will take the steps to reduce emissions, will do the things that we expect will see energy generated in a much cleaner and more efficient way, and will also leave a legacy of a better future for those who will follow us, as opposed to the scenario we've got now, where inaction is genuinely concerning people. Those opposite will deride young people for taking time out of school to protest about the inaction and inability of adults to actually take this seriously. They'll also dismiss the hundreds of thousands of people out in our streets, in our capital cities and across the globe, saying this stuff needs to be taken seriously. They'll dismiss all that. But that's what those people that are marching expect us to do. They expect this place to be able to come up with a regime and a suite of measures that will see emissions drop—not this kind of big stick stunt we're getting right now—and to be able to genuinely address climate change and genuinely find a way to do all the things that people expect and want to see happen.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct) Bill 2019. We've had 10 years of energy policy uncertainty and half a dozen failed attempts by both the government and the opposition to sort this out. As a result, household energy prices have ballooned by 56 per cent in the last decade, pushing many households around Australia into financial stress. The majority of this price increase was driven by network costs caused by gold plating, which is the network companies and these players have not been dealt with by this bill. We've seen increases in the wholesale electricity prices, not renewable generation. We have been under a policy of relying on coal-fired power and gas, and that has led to rising prices. In the last few years, the government has introduced legislation like the Default Market Offer and the Retailer Reliability Obligation to try to bring prices down. This bill, allegedly and supposedly, is going to help reduce prices further. This will be a test because this will be followed and watched closely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is in this bill? We've heard a lot about it, so it's important to understand it. The government is seeking to introduce new remedies for high power prices, specifically dealing with alleged anticompetitive conduct in the National Electricity Market. What does it purport to do? In the retail market, in the event of a sustained and substantial reduction in supply chain costs, retailers will be required to make reasonable adjustments to their retail prices for market offers, including to households and small businesses. In the wholesale market, generators will be prohibited from manipulating the spot market, and that can occur in a number of ways set out in the explanatory memorandum. In the contract market, energy companies will be prevented from withholding hedge contracts for the purpose of substantially lessening competition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation sets out graduated remedies that can apply in the event of misconduct. The ACCC will be able to issue a warning notice, accept an enforceable undertaking or seek a financial penalty of up to $10 million, three times the value of the total benefit attributable to the conduct, or 10 per cent of the annual turnover of the corporation in the 12 months before the conduct occurred—extremely significant, severe financial penalties. In addition, the ACCC will also be able to recommend that the Treasurer either issue a contracting order or pursue a divestiture order in the courts. The contracting order will essentially subvert the processes of a company and force it to run a business in a way that may not be consistent with its shareholders or internal decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What evidence do we have to rely on for the basis of this bill? I'm deeply concerned that this bill is trying to solve problems that, first of all, don't exist. I must say, there have been a number of speakers in this House who have made very important points, including the member for Indi yesterday. The government likes to point to alleged price manipulation behaviour around the closure of Hazelwood in Victoria as evidence for the necessity of these new remedies, but the Australian Energy Regulator investigated those events and found that the Hazelwood closure did not identify instances where the opportunistic exercise of market power significantly affected average price outcomes in Victoria or South Australia and therefore did not agree with the government that there had been such conduct. In a later report, they found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Despite this vulnerability to the exercise of market power, we did not identify short-term behaviour as contributing to recent price rises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the government doesn't want to listen to those findings. Instead, it wants to listen to its own agencies, who used flawed analysis from policy advisors like the Victoria Energy Policy Centre. In relation to the report that they came up with, Frontier Economics wrote this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The numerous methodological and procedural flaws in the Mountain-Percy report leave the evidence well short of that required to allege serious wrongdoing by market participants. Certainly, the report does not provide any suitable justification for the government’s misguided interventions in the NEM.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, finally, the ACCC, who will be tasked with providing recommendations to the government on prohibited conduct under this bill, said that the behaviour that this bill seeks to remedy has simply not occurred.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the likely effect of this bill? That's what we really need to be concerned about. Despite not having any evidence that justifies the remedies, the bill will have a significant effect on the National Energy Market. The Law Council of Australia concluded that the bill's remedies are heavy handed, disproportionate and overly bureaucratic market reforms to perceived prohibited conduct and to some extent double up on powers which already exist under section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act for market misconduct and the default market offer already introduced by the government. Furthermore, they suggest that, in attempting to remedy possible misconduct with sections like 153E, F, G, and H, this bill introduces uncertainty which will have negative effects on the market. These sections need considerable tightening up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation will further distort the market by adding further regulation, which will affect investment in an already fragile investment climate. The Grattan Institute echoes the Law Council's submission, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... hasty government intervention risks making things worse rather than better. Lowering prices ultimately requires private investment; a short-term ‘company bashing’ approach may well prove counter-productive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, on the alleged misconduct, they say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Not only did the ACCC never say these things are happening and they also said in their view having integrated gentailers was actually a good thing and would actually reduce the overall cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a particular concern with the provisions regarding contracting orders in sections 153W and 153X. Such powers require an assessment that should be made by a court, not the Treasurer. My concerns—and they have not been addressed in the explanatory memorandum or the bill or by the minister—are that these powers can be misused by the Treasurer to keep generators open or allow the minister to reopen closed generators that have been closed due to a company strategy, resolution or due care and safety reasons. If a company decides to close a fossil-fuelled power plant for commercial reasons or in line with their stance on climate, they must not be victims of coercion by this government to stay in the market, as we have witnessed with Liddell. I was assured by the minister that the powers under this bill would not be used for this purpose, but I call for this to be put on the public record by the minister. These orders cannot be used to force coal-fired power plants to stay open or be used for an ill-conceived plan by some to get control of a coal-fired power generator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the appropriate way forward? Market observers are saying that this legislation is the exact opposite of what the National Energy Market needs at the moment and that this bill is another part of a piecemeal attempt at energy policy. What we actually need to deal with energy prices is a settled energy policy, and the best we have had to date would be the National Energy Guarantee, which had bipartisan support from state governments and industry. Kerry Schott, the chair of the Energy Security Board, said, on the policy front:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One of the things that does make it difficult is the lack of integration of emissions reduction with the energy market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And the world would be much easier if we knew, for example, a national target out at 2050, or some guide of where we're going.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Integration of emissions reduction and a target are both what the National Energy Guarantee sought to remedy. This is further emphasised by the ACCC, who said in their latest report on the NEM price:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The National Energy Guarantee seeks to more clearly link the introduction of lower emissions generation sources to the ability to call on generators to produce energy when it is most needed. To the extent that this policy can encourage investment in capacity from a diverse range of sources, diluting market concentration and promoting competition to supply retailers, the policy should assist in delivering electricity affordability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If policy is not used in that way to integrate these factors, it will create further instability and discourage investment in the energy sector—if not the NEG then at least something to replace it. This could be a clean energy target that includes signals for firming, which was the 50th recommendation of the Finkel review. It was, at the time of the report, the most effective mechanism to drive investment in renewables, other than an emissions trading scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Academics like Blakers and Stocks at the Australian National University have identified enormous opportunities for renewables if we provide a mechanism for new transmission and transmission upgrades to enable renewable energy zones like New South Wales to Queensland via New England or access to zones in South Australia via the river link. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Integrated system plan</span>, which is Australia's most comprehensive energy system planning document to date, created by the Australian Energy Market Operator, lays out transmission possibilities and should be integrated into the government's energy policy decision making. Both AEMO and Blakers and Stocks simply state that, if we provided signal for transmission, this would bring on the next wave of investment and competition in the market. As for firming, Blakers and Stocks have identified over 22,000 pumped hydro sites in Australia, a fraction of which could meet Australia's storage needs for a 100 per cent renewable energy grid. In a recent committee hearing they maintained that 100 per cent renewable energy is not an engineering problem. It is technically straightforward; the only barrier is the politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the opportunities for Australia in energy? Australia has an unprecedented chance to turn the country into a renewable energy superpower. The <span style="font-style:italic;">GenCost 2018</span> report by CSIRO and AEMO, which investigated the cost of various forms of generation in Australia, showed us that renewable energy by itself is the cheapest cost of new generation, at roughly $45 to $55 per megawatt hour and, firmed with six hours of pumped hydro, would be roughly $90 to $100 per megawatt hour. This is because our abundant sun and wind resources and engineering ingenuity give us a natural advantage over other nations. We must harness this opportunity. People in Warringah want to see this. Many are willing to contribute to a new era in energy. We have renewable energy developers at the Manly Solar Beach hub, like Solar Choice, Edify Energy and WIRSOL, already helping to fix our energy mess. These companies have already developed over one gigawatt of renewable capacity in Australia. That is powering the equivalent of over 500,000 homes. Now they are on the new frontier of battery storage, contributing to pioneering projects like the Gannawarra battery and investigating the applications of virtual power plants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Outside of Warringah, we are already seeing plans for renewable energy exports to Indonesia, and massive renewable hydrogen projects as well. The Australian National University's Zero-Carbon Energy for the Asia-Pacific project is suggesting that we build a high-voltage undersea cable to Indonesia from the Northern Territory that could export 440 terawatt hours of electricity yearly. They are working with developers like CWP Renewables to achieve this. They further add that we could use renewables to make green steel and green hydrogen, and the combination of these would grow to the equivalent of our current fossil fuel energy exports and iron ore volume.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Renewable Energy Agency is supporting these kinds of endeavours. They are part financing early-stage hydrogen projects in Queensland. ARENA has put in a total of $2.9 million to one project in Moura, which is proposing to produce 20,000 tonnes per year of ammonia from 3,600 tonnes of renewable hydrogen. ARENA is doing this with projects across the board, from electric vehicle charging to battery storage, demand response and transmission technology. To keep up their good work, they urgently need assurances from the minister of continued funding past 2022. This agency is essential for our energy future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These projects are just some examples of what we can achieve if we set our minds to the future. To get us there, we need considered policy—not just big sticks, which will drive away investment and create instability. Customers will be the ones who will pay for that instability with higher prices, and they will pay for poor planning policy. I call on the government to present a considered energy policy that will take Australia into the future. Much more is needed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="231027" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TAYLOR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  This bill, theTreasury Laws Amendment (Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct) Bill 2019, delivers on our commitment to the Australian people to bring down power prices and stop dodgy conduct. It puts them back in control of their power bills. This bill once again shows that the Liberal-National government is on the side of hardworking Australians by ensuring energy savings are passed through to customers, introducing real penalties to stop the unacceptable and unsustainable conduct called out by the ACCC in their report last year and ensuring that big businesses can't manipulate the market to drive up prices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill, importantly, complements the work since the election. From 1 July, we implemented a price cap on the highest standing offers, which is bringing and has brought down power prices by as much as $663 for some households. This comes on top of the government's work to stop dodgy discounting and charges from the big energy companies, including sneaky late-payment fees that were crippling those who could least afford it. From 1 July, we have also delivered the Retailer Reliability Obligation, which requires retailers to guarantee their energy supply three years in advance. It will keep prices down and ensure that the lights stay on. Whilst there is still more to do, I'm pleased that the most recent data shows that Australian power prices are dropping in the CPI.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking forward, the government's Underwriting New Generation Investments program will deliver new reliable generation into the market, putting downward pressure on prices and ensuring, importantly, the security of the grid. Further, we've introduced legislation to ensure that lower power prices are passed on to customers by the big energy companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to the bill. The bill will amend the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, introducing a new legislative framework to support the ACCC's electricity price monitoring inquiry. The bill is a targeted and time-limited intervention that aims to act as a deterrent to electricity businesses from engaging in the kinds of behaviour that, in the current energy market, could result in poorer outcomes for consumers. The ACCC's inquiry will monitor retail prices, contract liquidity and wholesale bids and conduct in the National Energy Market between 2018 and 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACCC's new inquiry is framed around three key issues identified in the retail price inquiry final report, which was publicly released on 11 July 2018: first, retail pricing structures are confusing and make it difficult for consumers to compare and switch offers; second, new electricity retailers can face a barrier to entering the market due to liquidity issues in electricity contract markets; and, third, there is a general lack of competitive constraint in the wholesale electricity markets. The legislative framework complements the ACCC's inquiry with three new prohibitions designed to address the specific electricity market conduct that's detrimental to competition and consumer welfare. The retail pricing limb will target retailers that take unfair advantage of consumers' confusion around electricity offers and the difficulty of identifying and switching to better deals. It will require that supply chain cost savings are passed on to consumers on market offers, rather than increase retailer profits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contract liquidity limb and the wholesale bids conduct limb target anticompetitive behaviour in the markets which can lead to price increases that flow through to consumers. There are prohibitions on conduct that threatens the effective and efficient operation of electricity markets and leads to poor outcomes for consumers. These prohibitions are specifically designed to neither interfere with how our electricity markets are supposed to operate nor impact on genuine, efficient operational decisions by electricity market participants. Failure to offer a financial contract because of the plant being unavailable due to mothballing or closure would not be considered prohibited behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure effective enforcement of the prohibitions, the bill will equip the ACCC with a graduated set of remedies, including ACCC-issued public warning notices, ACCC-issued infringement notices and court-ordered civil penalties. For the most serious breaches of the new prohibitions, the legislation contains a notice, response and recommendation process, leading to the potential imposition of the strongest sanctions: Treasurer-issued contracting orders and court-ordered divestiture orders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where the ACCC identifies a potential serious breach, it will notify the relevant company. The company will be given an opportunity to respond by explaining and rectifying their conduct. If the ACCC is not satisfied with this response, the legislation provides a process for the Treasurer to make a contracting order or apply to the Federal Court for a divestiture order on a recommendation from the ACCC. Contracting orders will only be available for breaches of the contract liquidity prohibition as well as aggravated breaches of the wholesale conduct prohibition. Divestiture orders will only be available for aggravated breaches of the wholesale conduct prohibition. Both the ACCC and the Treasurer must consider the remedy proportionate and targeted to the conduct and, in the case of a divestiture order, that the order would result in a net public benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of a government owned corporation, a divestiture order can only require divestiture to another government owned corporation. The bill does not empower the court to order divestiture to a private purchaser. This ensures that the relevant asset remains in government ownership, while still addressing the misconduct in question and promoting competition. The appropriateness of seeking a divestiture order or contracting order will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. But divestiture will be considered a last-resort response, reserved for the most egregious breaches for which other remedies are not sufficient to address the conduct. These are significant remedies, and I do not expect to have to pursue them, but we will do so if required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is confident, particularly given the international experience, that divestiture orders, as a measure of last resort, will not act as a deterrent to investment in Australia. Indeed, the real deterrent to investment in Australia is anticompetitive conduct. While evidence may clearly establish that a corporation has engaged in the proscribed activity for the purposes of substantially lessening competition or to distort or manipulate spot-market prices, the bill follows precedent in the Competition and Consumer Act to allow the purpose of the corporation to be ascertained by inference from the conduct of the corporation, the conduct of other people or the circumstances relevant to the conduct. Provisions of this type already exist in the CCA in relation to hindering access to declared services, exclusive dealing and hindering a standard access obligation. The drafting of this provision reflects the existing law and the long-held understanding of the provision at law by all parties to provide clarity and certainty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These laws will commence six months after royal assent, allowing a transitional period for the ACCC to develop guidelines and make its enforcement approach clear to industry. The amendments circulated by the opposition simply replicate what will already be the effect of the bill. That said, to give complete comfort to the chamber, the government is willing to support these amendments. I thank the opposition for working with the government to ensure that these amendments do not have any unintended consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, this bill also amends the CCA to provide additional information-gathering powers to the Australian Energy Regulator. This will support their functions under the default market offer and the reference bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a key part of our policy platform—a policy platform that has no shortage of endorsements. The Western Australian state Labor government has said, 'The government won the election and has a mandate to follow its policies through.' The member for Hunter has backed our policies in a ruthless and unsparing review of the member for Hindmarsh, and the Australian Workers Union, which produced many of those opposite, now endorses the government's policy. While I welcome the constructive way that the opposition has now come to support this bill, I call on those opposite to back our policies on energy and emissions reduction across the board, as some already have. I commend this bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Rankin has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment moved by the member for Rankin be agreed to.</span>

I have dealt with them in my remarks in relation to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct) Bill 2019 more generally. They essentially deal with three issues. The first is to close absolutely the loophole that existed in the original bill and still exists in the bill in its current form around privatisation of publicly owned electricity assets, particularly in the states of Queensland, WA and Tasmania, where the communities have said time and time again that they want their electricity assets to be publicly owned. This was an issue first raised by the Labor Party and the member for Kennedy. The government has made some progress in relation to it, but amendment (1) closes the loophole entirely. I'm glad that the government is willing to support that.</span>

Obviously workers are not to blame in any sense for any of the conduct envisaged by this bill. Their entitlement should be protected absolutely. They should not be prejudiced in any way. Amendment (2) deals with those entitlements that are contained in registered enterprise agreements and awards by giving effect to those protections already contained in the Fair Work Act in the event of a divestiture order.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third amendment deals with a review of this legislation prior to the sunset clause going into operation. I commend all three amendments to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  I rise to support the amendments to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct) Bill 2019. This week, Labor's position has been raised with me. It has changed since the legislation was introduced during the last parliament, and that's because the legislation has been changed. The Labor Party makes no apology for sticking to our guns on some critical issues regarding this legislation. The Labor Party will always stand up for workers' entitlements. That is what we have ensured and will ensure through these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the Labor Party regards privatisation of essential assets as something that has proven to not achieve the outcomes that those people who argue that government should just get out of the way—'Leave it all to the market, and it'll somehow work out!'—think it will. In practice, in part as a direct result of privatisation, we have seen energy prices go up, not down. We have seen, due to a lack of energy policy from this government, prices continue to go up for consumers at the same time as emissions are going up. This government does not have an appropriate energy policy, and this legislation is not a substitute for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments deal with critical issues. We said that the original legislation brought forward by the government provided, essentially, a back-door way for the Commonwealth to dictate to state governments that assets should be privatised, in spite of the fact that privatisation of electricity has been a major issue during election campaigns in Queensland, on a number of them; in Western Australia, with the election of the McGowan government; and, of course, in Tasmania, where electricity assets remain in public hands. This legislation, as it stands, dealt with wholesale privatisation and ruled that out. But it left open partial privatisation of assets. Under these amendments, this is what will occur: if there is a divestiture proposed of any public asset, it can only be bought by another public asset. What that does is provide an assurance which Labor has sought. If these amendments are carried—and I expect them to be—Labor will have achieved an outcome that is appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue is that of workers' entitlements. We want to make sure that, as a result of this legislation, if divestiture does occur, no worker is worse off. We want to make sure, as a condition of our support, that that occurs. The amendments that we have ensure that the transmission of business provisions in the Fair Work Act apply, so that workers' entitlements will be transferred without any loss of leave entitlements, superannuation and all the other measures that apply. That is important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a third issue, which we will also deal with through the Senate inquiry—that is, that some workers' entitlements aren't part of award agreements. Some of them are in unregistered agreements; I particularly refer to agreements between the CFMEU Mining and Energy Division and AGL. Both AGL and the union want those entitlements to be protected. So we will pursue that through the Senate inquiry. We will pursue appropriate amendments in the Senate, and I would expect that, consistent with the government's support for the amendments that we're moving here, they would be accepted as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will always stand up for workers' entitlements. The government, when it framed this legislation, just didn't give them a second thought. That's not surprising, because that's the attitude that it has—never standing up for workers, never standing up for entitlements. This is the same government that's presiding over wage stagnation at a time when everyone from the Reserve Bank to the IMF is saying that it's having an impact on our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend these amendments to the House. They're important amendments. It's also important that we examine the impact of the legislation prior to the sunset clause kicking in. That's what the third amendment here does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Question agreed to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is clear is that this government wants a big stick so that it can beat companies into keeping coal-fired power stations in the system for longer. This comes at a time when the world's scientists have said that, to have any chance of meeting the targets that the world signed up to in the Paris Agreement, we need an orderly plan to replace coal-fired power stations with renewable energy at a rate of about one a year between now and 2030. So we need to be closing coal-fired power stations and replacing them with renewables in an orderly way. We need a plan to do that. That's what the science that the government purports to accept says.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what has been clear from the contributions to the debate so far from both sides—and I'll go to specifics in a moment—is that this bill allows the government to use the powers in the legislation to effectively keep coal-fired power stations like Liddell open for longer. From the government side one need look no further than the contribution from the member for Hughes, who said–and I quote from <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have in New South Wales a coal-fired power station, Liddell, that AGL say they want to close down … That is anti-competitive conduct …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Therefore, that is why this legislation is so important. We cannot stand back and watch a company with a very substantial degree of market power in an industry that supplies an essential service like electricity engage in anti-competitive conduct by closing down a coal-fired power station—</span>

The member for Shortland, who is the assistant spokesperson on this, made the point in his contribution yesterday that it potentially threatens the arrangements around the closure of Liddell, and the member for Kingsford Smith made exactly the same point. The opposition is about to support through this place a bill that everybody in this chamber seems to accept allows intervention to keep coal-fired power stations in the system for longer. That is a bad provision to have in the bill. I expect it from the government, but the opposition should not be supporting it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do two things. One is to amend the legislation to exclude the ability for the powers under the legislation to apply when there is a planned coal-fired power station closure. That's what amendments (3), (4) and (8) do. I urge everyone in this chamber to support the amendments so it will be crystal clear that AGL can proceed with its planned closure of Liddell and that other companies who accept the science can announce in good time that they're going to close their coal-fired power stations and know that this legislation will not be used, as everyone accepts it can be at the moment, to interfere with their projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing we need to do—and I understand that the opposition has made reference to things that might happen during the Senate inquiry, so I hope the opposition will change its position—is insist on these amendments when this bill comes before the Senate, so that we don't pass a piece of legislation that allows this climate-denying government to keep coal in the system for longer. Everyone is now on the same page that the government can do that, if we pass this bill. I commend these very sensible amendments to the House, so that, if the government is not going to do the right thing and come up with an orderly plan to replace coal with renewables, as they've done in other countries, then companies who decide that they want to do it won't be inhibited by this bill from so doing.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  I thought I might make some broad remarks about all of the amendments moved by the member for Melbourne. I very clearly understand the first substantive policy point contained in those amendments, around taxpayer financing for new coal-fired power stations or for extending existing coal-fired power stations. It's a point I've made myself in this debate on more occasions than I could count over the last few years, but it's not a matter covered by this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also understand the second substantive policy point that was really the focus of the member for Melbourne's remarks then, about the powers contained in this act being used, effectively, to manipulate the closure schedules of existing coal-fired power stations. I think that point would certainly have much more weight, were the powers to order divestiture still in the minister's hands, with the greatest of respect to the minister. But, with the changes that we have been able to obtain so that those powers are now in the hands of the Federal Court, on the advice of the ACCC, I don't think that those points have the weight that they may have had previously. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, though, I make the point, as the Leader of the Opposition indicated just then, that our focus—particularly in this bill, because we think the bill will pass both chambers in one form or another—has been to protect against the privatisation of those publicly owned assets that remain in the jurisdictions that the Leader of the Opposition outlined, and to ensure that there is no prejudice to worker entitlements in the event that a divestiture order is made. We're utterly committed to delivering those two protections for communities, who have said time and time again that they want their electricity assets to remain in public hands and also worker entitlements—two things I know the member for Melbourne feels strongly about as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the member for Melbourne's amendments are not going to be passed by this parliament. We understand the policy position. I have some sympathy, obviously—I've said that time and time again myself—for the policy positions being advanced by the member for Melbourne. But our focus, our very clear focus in this debate, is on those two protections that were identified by the Leader of the Opposition.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I thought I'd take this opportunity just to make a couple of comments on this amendment and the speech we just heard from the member for Melbourne. This bill is focused on competition policy, on competition reform. The Greens can't see the world through any other lens but emissions. Emissions are important. We're focused on emissions and we have clear policies which will overachieve on our 2020 targets, and we've laid out to the last tonne how we'll reach our 2030 targets. But to the Greens there is no issue other than emissions, and anticompetitive conduct is something they're completely happy to live with. They seem completely unconcerned about it, because they have one lens through which they look at the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in this place just last week they moved a motion on climate emergency, and I've been puzzled as to what the definition of that is. Well, the member for Melbourne has been helping us out with that. The definition has been given by the Greens in the Senate. It is clear: no oil, no gas, no coal—and, frankly, in that world, no hope. There is no hope, because that is what the Greens want to see, and they see the world through that lens only. I'm looking forward to seeing how the Greens are going to get to the parliament in future sittings, and I'm not sure how they're going to get home, because oil is pretty important for transport around this country. But they are focused simply on emissions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things they want is to see all of our coal-fired power stations bulldozed straightaway. They want to see them gone. We have seen what mismanaging this does in Victoria, where the Victorian government encouraged the closure of the Hazelwood power station. We saw a large slab of electricity supply going out of the market. We were assured by people like the Greens that this wouldn't have an impact on prices. Well, we saw exactly what it did. It more than doubled the wholesale price of electricity on the day it was announced. Now, that doesn't worry the Greens, because they want to see a higher price for electricity so that people don't use it. They don't like electricity. They don't like economic development. They don't like a strong economy, because a strong economy to them is at odds with what they want to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our approach to coal-fired power stations is characterised by the Liddell task force, where we've been very, very clear. If we have a coal-fired generator which is planned for closure, we put notice periods in place, as a result of the recommendations of the Finkel review, and we want to see either like-for-like replacement or life extension. It is simple. We can't afford to see large parts of the electricity supply disappearing from the marketplace, because guess who will pay? It will be the hardworking families and small businesses of Australia and the people employed by energy-intensive industry who will pay the price for mad green policies that are all about the premature closure of coal-fired power stations—and gas as well. They hate gas as much as they hate coal. This bill is squarely focused on anticompetitive conduct, on manipulation and distortion of the market, on shutting out new competitors coming into the market, on failing to pass on substantial and sustained savings to customers. These are things that really matter to middle Australia. That's the focus of the legislation. We're pleased that Labor is joining us. We're happy to support their amendments of course, because they were already embodied in the original bill. For the avoidance of doubt, we're happy to support Labor's amendments but we're not going to support the amendments put up by the Greens.</span>

Fantastic! Great move! Well done, Angus. You've lifted pollution and you've lifted power prices. The independent Australian Energy Regulator has said people are paying more on their power bills now than when the carbon price was enforced and we were reducing pollution as well as generating money that could be used for households and put into renewable energy.

                    </a>  I'm not going to take a lecture from the minister about power prices when, after they abolished the carbon price, wholesale power prices doubled. That is the effect of what they've done. And now they're playing catch-up, trying to work out how to keep coal in the system for longer and bring down prices. What they haven't worked out is you can't do both. If we had an orderly procedure for replacing coal with renewables, where the fuel is free for renewables, then we'd bring down pollution and bring down power bills. As I said, it takes a special kind of genius to lift pollution and lift power bills, but that's what this minister's been able to do, because he has made the industry the most uncertain it has been for a very, very long time. And this bill is going to do more of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What he shows in his contributions talking about the so-called premature closure of power stations is two things. One is that he's a science denier through and through. He just does not accept what the world scientists have said—that there's a link between coal and global warming and that, if we want to give ourselves the best chance of defeating the climate crisis, we have to have an orderly plan to replace coal with renewables. It's basic physics. But the minister doesn't believe in physics. That's what we've heard in his response, and that's no surprise. The government's facade, their new approach, for dealing with climate change is no longer to say, 'We don't accept the science,' but to say, 'We accept the science, but, don't worry, we're doing something about it.' It's a paper-thin veneer. You can just see the minister itching to say, 'No, we want coal around forever and we don't believe in renewables at all.' That was basically the essence of his contribution just then. That's why we need these amendments. We're hearing the deniers out in force; they're running the show, and we shouldn't be aiding and abetting them. If the minister says, 'Look, this bill is only about anticompetitive conduct,' then he should support the amendments, because all the amendments say is, 'You can have the rest of the provisions, the bill just can't get in the way of an orderly closure of coal-fired power stations.' You can have the rest of your bill. If he truly believes it's got nothing to do with climate and everything to do with competition, then he should support these amendments because it shouldn't get in the way.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the opposition spokesperson, the amendments that have been moved around entitlements and so on are amendments that we support. They are worthy amendments and I'm glad they got through. But we only need them because the bill, now, is going to get through with Labor and Liberal support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last parliament, the position we were in was that by standing up to the government and saying, 'No, there are certain things we won't allow you to do,' we were able to get them to put the legislation off, to the point where it potentially was not going to be passed at all. I say again, with respect, it's not enough to say that the Federal Court is now involved—and, by the way, they weren't amendments that the opposition secured; they were in the revised bill that was put already. It's not enough to say that. Are you seriously saying that it won't affect a company's decision if they have the threat of litigation hanging over them, instigated by the minister? Of course it will. If a company has to work out whether it has to go through an ACCC process and then potentially a Federal Court process, all initiated by the minister, it is going to affect their decision. They will say, 'Okay, if the price you want for taking the foot off our throats is that we're going to keep the coal-fired power station open for longer, then that is what is going to happen.' It is crystal clear from the government that that is what they want. We should amend the bill to remove the ability for the deniers in government to keep coal-fired power stations open for longer.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear from the last two votes in this parliament that the government and the opposition are prepared to intervene in the energy market and tell companies what to do, and it's clear that the government and the opposition are content with intervening to say, 'Let's keep coal-fired power stations open for longer even where the companies agreed to close them down.' So we are squarely within the realm of: what is the appropriate way for the government to get involved in the energy market?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments do a very simple thing. These amendments say that you cannot use public money to keep open a coal-fired power station for longer or to help build a new one. That is very, very important when we are dealing with the question of how the government is going to get in and rummage around in the internal workings of the energy market—as this bill is clearly dealing with—and where we now have a bipartisan position that it is okay to keep coal-fired power stations open for longer, using the powers under this bill—</span>

                    </a>  Well, you just voted for it. You may not know it, but you just voted for it. I hear the interjection from the member for Macnamara. We know, separately, that the government want to intervene in the market to use public money to keep coal-fired power stations open for longer. We know that because we've read in newspapers that they are finalising their shortlist and they want to take money that could be going to schools and hospitals and use it to keep coal-fired power stations open for longer or, in other ways, support the operations of existing coal-fired power stations or potentially create new ones. These amendments would put a stop to that. These amendments say, 'No; public money is for schools, hospitals and renewables.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when we need an orderly government plan to retire coal-fired power stations and replace them with renewable energy, we should not allow the government to intervene in a way that is going to prop up an industry that should be on the path towards managed closure—in an orderly way that respects the workers, that keeps the lights on and that ensures that prices start coming down. These amendments are very sensible and, in the past, the opposition and others have supported them. I hope that this is a set of amendments that can be carried, because at the moment we know that the government are hell-bent on using every power they have to use public money to keep more coal in the system—and we have to stop them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who believe in the free market should support this because it's about saying, 'Don't use government money to subsidise something that should be on the way out.' And this is something that should be supported by those who believe in climate change and accept the science of climate change. I suspect that, if you asked most people in this country, 'How would you rather a public dollar be spent: do you want it to make dental care available for everyone under Medicare, do you want it to go to schools and hospitals or do you want it to prop up coal-fired power stations?' they would say, 'We would rather it go to services.' I think most people would be shocked to know that the government currently does have the power to give public money to coal-fired power stations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend these amendments to the House. I hope that, especially in the context where the door has been opened by the opposition by saying, 'We're going to accept the government's bill on certain provisos,' they include this proviso as well. If they're now in the business of negotiating and doing deals with the climate-denying government to pass their energy policy, then they should insist on something that will stop the government keeping coal-fired power stations open for longer than they should, especially if it involves taking money from the public purse and putting it towards coal-fired power stations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are, in some circumstances, going into the ninth year of drought on the eastern seaboard, and of course there is not a state nor a territory in the Commonwealth which is not in some way adversely impacted by this drought. If it is not already, it will soon be the worst drought in our history—at least, since the time of European settlement. It is hurting lots of people—not just our farmers but people in rural communities everywhere. The economies of those communities are turning downwards. When the farmer is doing it tough, he or she purchases less in the town and less from the farm supplies business, and everyone is impacted. Of course, many of those communities are also suffering at the hands of terrible bushfires which are, themselves, a function of a changing climate—a hotter climate, a drier climate—a climate which is causing high temperatures earlier in the year than we would expect and a climate which, over time, has produced a lot of unspent fuel sources in and around those communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lots of workers who don't get much mention in our debate here about the drought but should get more mention are all those who work on-farm for farmers, and there are many of them. Many of them are now out of work or getting only intermittent work. That doesn't make life particularly easy, because that frustrates someone's access to income support through Centrelink. If they're in and out of work all the time or they're getting fluctuating rates and hours of work then they don't get the support that farmers will receive through this bill and the legislation it is amending. Some of them will be working for the local rural supplier's business or the local mechanic or the local electrician or some other tradesman and are now not getting the work they previously were able to secure because there's less work in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, some of those communities are literally running out of water. Even big communities like Tamworth, Armidale and Murrurundi, in the member for New England's electorate, are all too close to running out of water; in fact, Murrurundi did run out of water some time ago. We are very careful that, in the absence of meaningful rain in the next six months, year, maybe two years or, even worse, three years, we are potentially facing what I'd describe as a war-like situation. Some tough decisions might need to be made about whether we keep moving water to people or people to water, for example, whether there are some commodities that we can save and some we can't save. Some we will need to save with our limited resources and some we won't be able to save. I pray every day that we never face that situation, but it's a real possibility. The weather forecasters don't give us any hope of summer rains. They don't give us much hope of meaningful rains through the winter of next year. And, you know, it's easy to come to the conclusion there's no reason to be optimistic beyond that either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the government needs to establish and determine some scenarios, just as, as I said in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> this morning, a general would: assess the geopolitical situation, the risk of war and what the scenarios look like and then build a battle plan to respond to each of those scenarios. This is what this government hasn't done. At least, we're not aware that this has been done. If I am wrong, I will be very, very relieved but, sadly, I suspect I am not. The government needs to be asking itself: 'What do we do if it doesn't rain for another six months? What do we do if it doesn't rain meaningfully for another year? What do we do if it doesn't rain for another two or three years?' As scary as that proposition might be, it should have a battle plan for each. Generals don't wait for the battle to begin before establishing their battle plan; they make their assessments well in advance, they determine the scenarios, and they have a battle plan and contingencies for each. We don't have that in this country and we should have. I hope I'm wrong, but there is a possibility that we will be facing some very, very challenging times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Leader of the Opposition and I have reached out to the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister and suggested that, given the severity of the situation, we sit down around a table—all parties—to talk about those scenarios, to assess those scenarios and to think about what will need to be done by government to ensure that the impact on the Australian community is less than it might otherwise be. That offer was extended very sincerely and genuinely, and I extend it again here today. I appeal to the Prime Minister to come to the table. He can have his jokes about the semantics of whether or not there was a war cabinet, or whether it was a war advisory council. The Australian people don't want us arguing about such frivolous points. What they do want us to do is sit down together, fully comprehend the seriousness of the situation and hatch a plan to do something about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister says he has a plan. The drought minister says he will have a plan; he said he will have a plan when the National Farmers' Federation delivers its plan. Well, the National Farmers' Federation has now delivered its plan, and it's time the government delivered a plan too. National Party MPs, we see in the newspaper today, are frustrated too. They're so frustrated that they've decided not to wait for the Prime Minister; rather, they've hatched their own 10-point plan, sadly cobbled together and every bit as ad hoc as the Prime Minister's approach to drought has been over the last—well, six years for the government, but only a year for him. It's no plan, but the fact that rebellious Nationals MPs are breaking away from their leader and their Prime Minister to deliver their own plan underscores the point the opposition has been making now for weeks, if not months: that we don't have a plan, we need a plan and we need it now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, we needed it six years ago, which is where this sad story began. Six years ago, on coming to office, the then Prime Minister and former member for Warringah, Tony Abbott, and the then agriculture minister—still the member for New England—decided to put the brake on the COAG drought policy reform process. Imagine that! Prior to that, something historic had occurred. The states, the Commonwealth, the major political parties, the National Farmers' Federation and all of their affiliates agreed that the drought architecture we had in this country was not working. It was inefficient, it was ineffective, it was full of moral hazard and it had to go. It's a big call. But they were determined to prepare themselves for the next drought with a policy which was more meaningful, more economically efficient for the taxpayer, devoid of moral hazard and which, of course, built resilience in our farming community. The COAG committee which was charged with progressing that reform was the Standing Council on Primary Industries, a formal arm of the COAG architecture, but it was abolished.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the Prime Minister of the day, and those who have followed him—including the current Prime Minister—thought the rain would come. It's a wonderful confidence we see in our rural communities. Farmers tell me almost every time I speak with them, 'Every day is a day closer to rain.' It's an admirable optimism. It's a courageous optimism. It does help to build emotional strength in our rural communities. But the Prime Minister of the day can't be that relaxed. The Prime Minister of the day has to plan on the basis that it might not rain—or, indeed, when it does rain, it might be many, many days away. He doesn't have that latitude and shouldn't take that approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did he and those who served before him do? They thought they'd just take an ad hoc, piecemeal approach—roll out a program here, roll out a program there—and hope it rained, and rained soon. And then the current Prime Minister thought he'd lose an election. I'm sure he is very happy he didn't—much happier than we are, obviously! I think he believed it would be a Labor problem now, but it remains his problem. Notwithstanding that, the hand of friendship and bipartisanship is there for him, and he should take it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing he should do is stop claiming he is spending $7 billion a year on drought assistance. People no longer have to take my word for it when I say that that is a shocking exaggeration, a shocking embellishment. Thanks to Senate estimates just this week, that assertion by me has been confirmed by departmental officials both in the agriculture department and in the Department of Finance. We know how he got to that $7 billion. He got there very quickly by including the so-called $5 billion Future Drought Fund, which we know is not $5 billion and won't be $5 billion for 10 years; it's $3.9 billion. More specifically, it's a fund which won't draw down until after July next year. When it begins to draw down money, it will draw $100 million every year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, that's not a bad thing. We support the provision of future funding for the building of drought resilience. We don't have any disagreement with that. That is a good thing, although the money should not have been robbed from the Building Australia Fund, which itself was dedicated to regional infrastructure. We don't have any problem with the concept or the principle. But not one cent, as confirmed by the Prime Minister right here, at that dispatch box, will go to a farmer. Not one cent will go to a farmer! For the Prime Minister to claim $7 billion by including that $5 billion is being more than loose with the truth. And then of course it includes a billion dollars worth of concessional loans, which most farmers have decided are of no help to them. More debt or shuffling debt, they say, is not going to save the day for them. Of course, the cost for the government of providing concessional loans is quite modest. The government borrows at the bond rate, which is very low at the moment, and provides a concessional loan at a slightly higher rate. I'm not saying there aren't costs—of course there are—but it should not be counted towards the so-called $7 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course there are loans to the states for water infrastructure. There are another couple billion dollars there, or just a billion dollars—I can't recall, but it's big numbers—but these are loans to the states which have to be matched by the states. This is why they haven't been particularly successful. The states are under pressure as a result of fiscal vertical imbalance, so they don't have the money to match that. I think the Department of Finance told us that, over the next four years, the government will spend $2.5 billion. That is not $7 billion, not $6 billion, but $2.5 billion over four years. That's being pretty generous too, because, again, it depends on how you count some of these programs, which are either designed to fail or contingent on repayments. But, more importantly, they aren't really helping farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't mind the Prime Minister being loose with the truth with farmers and rural communities. I'm not happy about it, but, let's face it, politicians do that from time to time; the current Prime Minister won't be the first to be guilty of it. But what makes me genuinely angry is that the $7 billion is used as an excuse not to do more. That's what the $7 billion tool is really all about. When asked whether he'll do more for farmers, the Prime Minister's standard response is, 'I'm already investing $7 billion'—code for, 'I shouldn't really do any more, because $7 billion is a lot of money in anybody's language.' He knows that many Australians who aren't farmers, who might live in the capital cities, love our farmers. They recognise them as salt-of-the-earth, hardworking people who deliver our food and fibre. He wants them to know also that $7 billion is a lot of money, and he lives in the hope that they'll agree that it's not necessary to spend more, because $7 billion is an enormous amount of money. What really makes me angry is that his $7 billion loan is an excuse not to do more at a time when we desperately need to do more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A good start would be to stop cutting income support payments for Australian farming families. Six hundred families have already been cut off the Farm Household Allowance and another 500 are to be cut off by Christmas. What a wonderful Christmas present for those farming families! Remember, these are amongst the most desperate of our farming families. Farm Household Allowance, be in no doubt, is a difficult payment to secure. Ask the hundreds who have tried and failed, or spent weeks, if not months, trying to succeed. To cut them off now while this drought is ongoing—remembering that we're talking about a very modest payment, sufficient to put food on the table and maybe a little bit of cashflow into the farm business to get to the other end—is a callous act. It's hard to fathom when the opposition sits here and offers bipartisanship. The Prime Minister is not going to get any criticism from us by extending the period for which farming families remain on Farm Household Allowance; in fact we're appealing for him to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For balance, let me tell you what the Prime Minister will argue. It's something we all agreed with back in 2012. We all agreed that the income support payment for farmers, which is just like Newstart but has far more relaxed income and asset test provisions, shouldn't be forever. COAG originally decided that it should be for three years and that, during that period, the farm enterprise and the farming family have to decide how they reshape their business model, or to get out. That was, in 2012, a reasonable proposition. I note that, in one of the earlier amendments we dealt with here, that was extended to four years. But no-one here now, or no-one who was in the conversation then in 2012, could have possibly conceived that the drought would be so lengthy and so harsh.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The test of viability now should not be whether you can get through the ninth or 10th year of the drought. Sure, back then—remembering that Farm Household Allowance isn't just a drought payment; it's a hardship payment typically provided to drought affected farmers—it was reasonable for us to believe that, after three or four years, if the farming enterprise hadn't been able to sufficiently adjust its methods or its business model, it might be time to get out. And there will still be examples of that; there will always be examples of that. But those who are still hanging on in the seventh and eighth year are amongst the viable. The test of viability shouldn't be that you make it to the ninth or 10th year. That's the difference. When the facts change, you change your mind and you change the policy. We should all say together, 'Wow, this is something very significant, something unanticipated, something not expected, something no-one could have foreseen.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to take away the time cap, which is forcing farmers off income support, and park it away until we get to the other end of this drought, and let's all pray that it comes sooner rather than later. I don't think there's an Australian out there who thinks that we should be throwing farming families off income support—a very modest payment—at this point in time. I'm disappointed in those who are publicly disagreeing with me. Amongst them is the member for New England, who outrageously claimed last night on the ABC that to extend farm household allowance to farming families beyond four years would be an affront to our WTO arrangements. You can just see it: the Europeans would be straight on the phone to say, 'You made an agreement you wouldn't have any subsidies, and therefore distortions, in the market.' Imagine them arguing that extending a modest $250 payment to a farmer who is destitute and barely able to keep their animals alive is going to distort the international market. It's not only a ridiculous proposition, but it's ridiculous to put it. If that's the best excuse they can come up with for cutting farming families off farm household allowance, well, God save us all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support this bill, just as we've supported every other bill—this is the 12th we've supported. This is the 12th package of amendments to the farm household allowance, and we've supported each and every one of them. And along the way, in this place, in Senate estimates and in the public domain, successive ministers have told us, before the arrival of the next bill in this place, that farm household allowance is perfect and nothing needs to be done. I remind the House that when the member for New England doctored his <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> in this place—a shocking event that led to the sacking of a highly regarded and respected public servant—it was for an answer he provided to a question I asked in this place about farm household allowance. They've been embellishing—when I say 'they', I mean the government—the effectiveness of farm household allowance, since March 2020, since the inception of the allowance. But here we are, after 12 packages of improvements.</span>

                    </a>  I'll take that interjection. They improved it, and that's why we're supporting it. But don't interject to suggest that this is sufficient to cover off on what our farming families need. Let's keep it in perspective, too. The government says, 'Well, this is the first provision. Instead of being able to secure farm household allowance for only four years, you can get it for four in every 10.' Let me share with the Australian community what that means. It means that if I went on the payment in 2014 and I'm coming off it now—the government's cutting me off it now—I would be able to reapply in 2024.</span>

                    </a>  And if I were the minister, I would not provoke me! The second thing it does is to further relax the income test. That's a good thing. We support that. But those worried about not being captured by $100,000 rather than $80,000 aren't the people, necessarily, who are destitute, Minister, so let's please keep this in perspective.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing it does is to introduce these lump sum payments. So what the government is saying here is: 'We're not going to cut you off after four years, now; we're going to cut you off after four and a half years.' I'm impressed with their optimism. Maybe what they're saying is that they expect these farmers not to be in need of any allowance in six months time. I doubt it, sadly. I wish that were true. But I sadly doubt it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now dealing with lateness again. This bill has to be passed before this lump sum payment can be secured. I've had a look at the parliamentary calendar, and, at best, this bill will pass through the parliament and go to royal assent in mid-November. It'll probably pass the Senate on Remembrance Day, if we get on with it. And we're here to facilitate it. But what happens to those who've already been cut off, until then? Of course, those who have been cut off before then will have to reapply for this payment, for this lump sum, and, gee, I pray that the process is nowhere near as horrific for farmers as was the original application to secure farm household allowance.</span>

                    <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  I rise to support the original motion, that the Farm Household Support Amendment (Relief Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2019 be read a second time. This gives me an opportunity to speak not only on the changes that we are making to farm household assistance but also on the general package of drought assistance that we are offering to Australian farmers and Australian communities at this time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, in South Australia, the agricultural paper the <span style="font-style:italic;">Stock Journal</span> asked in a survey if the federal government was doing enough on the drought. Eighty-five per cent of the respondents said no. This was put to me at a Q&amp;A panel in Jamestown at the local show. They said, 'How did you respond to that?' I said, 'Did any of the 85 per cent actually suggest what we should do?' I'm a farmer by trade. I spent 30 years farming before I came to this place and I don't find farmers coming to me and saying, 'You should do this. You should do that.' Generally, people who are not in the farming business are offering comments and suggestions to government, but not specifics. I note Fiona Simson from the National Farmers' Federation has also said we need a national drought policy but is actually very scant on the detail and what that national drought policy should look like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would maintain that we have a national drought policy—a very extensive national drought policy. I'll come to that later in this speech. What we seek to do here is amend the farm household assistance program. Since 2014, we have put $365 million into this program and 12,700 farming households have benefited from that. Farm household assistance, as the previous speaker, the member for Hunter, said, is a pretty low payment. It's at the Newstart level. But it is about putting food on the table, making sure the kids can go to school with shoes on their feet, making sure they get to school, and paying the electricity bills. It's not about supporting the farm operations. There are other things in place to try to do that. It's about giving people dignity, a reason to get out of bed in the morning and making sure their families are running correctly, and that makes it a good payment. The difference to Newstart is that they don't have to report for work; they can get on with running their farms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have continued to adapt this program through the drought as the drought has altered. The previous speaker, the member for Hunter, said, 'Who could have imagined that we'd still be in drought in 2014?' That would seem to suggest that, as the drought has become deeper and deeper in places we wouldn't have expected it, we had to adjust the program. Last year, we gave $12,000 of support to affected households in two payments—$6,000 in each payment. We increased the asset threshold to $5 million. You can have a net worth of $5 million and still apply for farm household support.    Quite rightly, we assess that, if you've got $10 million of assets, you should be able to borrow some money to support your own household. I don't think that's an unfair parameter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this bill we also seek to extend the access to farm household assistance from four years in the life of the person, or in the life of the entity, to 10. The member for Hunter centred on this particular criteria. It is a significant improvement from when the Labor Party introduced this legislation, when it ran for three years—for a lifetime entitlement, if you like. For those who can access the full amount for four years, we're putting in place a $13,000 payment to allow them to adjust and get on with their life. We're also increasing the off-farm income from $80,000 to $100,000. This would mean that, for instance, a farmer's wife or husband—who might be a school teacher or might work at a bank, or whatever it might be that they do to support the farming operations and the family—are not costing them the ability to quality for farm household assistance. That is a reflection of wages in the community—the reality of what many of these farming families do to make sure that their enterprise is viable. There you go. I farmed for 30 years and spent the whole time being married to a school teacher. Many people have said in the past that it's the best way to drought-proof your life: marry a school teacher. I take my hat off to the people who go off-farm and earn income to support the farming operation and the family. It's not easy—we all pay a penalty for it—but it's a way of making sure that your family and your operations are viable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased about the fact that we are now allowing the income from agistment to be included in farm income rather than off-farm income. I was approached by a constituent, a farmer, about this exact circumstance. He had destocked his farm and was a cropper. He brought sheep in on agistment to allow the neighbour to access some feed and to bring him a modest income, but that denied him the right to apply for farm household assistance. We're fixing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is making the forms and the process of applying for farm household support easier by making sure that people are addressed as an entity rather than as individuals. All these are good things; it all helps. We are also, through the Drought Community Support Initiative, making up to $3,000 cash payments available to families through organisations like the CWA, the Salvation Army and St Vinnies, and good on them for being back at the coal face, helping the government to deliver support and obviously adding their own support. They're on the ground, they know the communities they live in, and I thank them all for their efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the board, the government has a wide range of initiatives. I spoke earlier about how I believe we do have a very good national drought package. Apart from the farm household assistance, we provide funding for the National Drought Map, which is on the FarmHub website. This map gives farmers the ability to go in there and have a look at what's available. I speak to a lot of farmers—most of my best friends are farmers; I live in a farming community—and a lot of them are unaware of what's available. It's only a click away on the computer but they're still unaware, so the more places we can present this information, the more times we can tell them to go and consult with their rural financial counsellors, the better. We announced another $5 million to support the counselling service and that puts another person in my patch, in the electorate of Grey, as a rural financial counsellor. The message again and again to farmers is do not self-assess. But we do put that information up there on the FarmHub.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has put almost $30 million extra into mental health and wellbeing. The loans is where the federal government really steps into place to make sure that people are there to put another crop in, to make sure they come to another shearing. We have low-interest drought loans, we have low inter-business improvement loans, we have—and I think these are very good—low-interest replanting loans. Importantly, with these, there is no interest payable by the farmer for two years. That means they can borrow the money for the fertiliser, for the chemicals, for the cost of putting the crop in and for the fuel. They can grow a crop, they can sell the crop and they can receive the money for the crop before they have to pay any interest on the low-interest loan. The same thing applies to restocking loans. Once it has rained and they've got feed in the paddocks, a farmer can go and buy stock—they'll be expensive—with these restocking loans. They can buy themselves some calves, grow them up, get them onto the market, sell them and get the money before they have to pay the interest. I think that shows very sound judgement. They are good, sound loans to farmers. They continue to say: 'We don't want a handout; we want a hand up.' Low-interest loans, loans where you don't pay interest for two years, are all about providing a hand up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is offering grants of up to $2,500 to implement the introduction of multiperil crop insurance and single-peril crop insurance, for instance. We have new insurance products. A lot of organisations and a lot of farming groups are working very hard across Australia to try and make multiperil crop insurance the norm rather than the outlier. We're putting up $2,500 for the base level business case because, if you take out multiperil crop insurance, you have to show to the insurers how much your farm has been producing over a long period of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because the government recognise that farmers are not the only people who suffer during the drought, that the community suffers as well, we've established the Drought Communities Program. In my electorate of Grey, we've had 20 councils qualify for these grants of $1 million each. Things like sporting clubs, community facilities, community assets, water-harvesting programs, town halls, showgrounds and visitor centres have all benefited from this program. Importantly, this provides some sustenance to the local tradesmen, the people in the town, the people who do the work, because we recognise they're not getting the same level of work as before the drought, because the farmers have closed the cheque books on discretionary spending. I have talked about the rural financial counsellors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also got programs for building resilience, and this is actually what I think is the visionary stuff. The best program I have ever seen as a farmer that helps farmers prepare for inevitable drought is the farm management deposits. Recently, two or four years ago, we lifted the limits so now an individual farmer can take, in a good year, $800,000 off the top of the profits, stick it in a bank account and take the tax deduction. And for a partnership it's $1.6 million. They can put it aside, not for a rainy day—or perhaps it can be for a rainy day—but for a dry day. It's drought insurance. I checked about half an hour ago and the last figure we had for farm managed deposits Australia-wide is still increasing. For drought, farmers have saved up $6.7 billion. So, while some are facing difficulties now, many, with the support of the Australian taxpayers and the Australian government, have accumulated funds so they don't have to call on the public purse when it comes to dry times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have immediate deductibility for water and fodder infrastructure. A farming family I know had two huge hay sheds full of hay before the drought. Last year, as the hay prices climbed, they sold it all off. A lot of the hay went to the eastern states. I was talking to the owner, one of the operators, and he said: 'You know what we're going to do? We sold off our two lots of hay at good profits and kept hay for ourselves, and now we're going to use that money to build another hay shed because we get immediate tax deductibility of that asset. Next time, when it rains, we'll have three hay sheds full of hay.' This will expand the ability of all Australian farmers to withstand the drought because it will mean there will be more hay held in storage in Australia when it comes to the next drought. It's the same for investment in water infrastructure. There are 13 properties that I'm aware of in the Eyre Peninsula where farmers have invested in plastic water runs so they can harvest every drop of water, every drop of dew that runs off that particular area. It increases the efficiency of water runs by hundreds and hundreds of per cent. Water priced at $3.50 a kilolitre could make an enormous difference to the bottom line of the farm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got the capital purchases, the immediate write-off of items up to $30,000 and $3½ billion for dams, weirs and infrastructure. We currently have $3.9 billion in the Drought Future Fund, and the member for Hunter spoke about this. It will return $100 million a year just for the kinds of projects I've been speaking about—building infrastructure, backing capital investment, building on ideas and investment for the future so farmers are better adapted to deal with the dry times in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things we've invested in for a long time in Australia is research and development, particularly the GRDC for the grains industry and the ALMC for livestock. I look at my property now, which is in a drought that's at least as bad as 1982, which is the worst drought in my memory, and there's no moving soil. The ground is all tied down. We don't have moving soil because we changed the agricultural practices that operate in Australia, and we changed those on the back of the fantastic research we've done in this country which has backed farmers to grow more grain out of less rain and ensure they can look after our soils for future generations and Australia generally. That comes from the long-term practice of governments setting good infrastructure frames in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say we've got a fantastic national drought policy. I refute the claims of people who say we do not.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  As the shadow minister has indicated, we will be supporting the measures of this bill, but I'm also here supporting his second reading amendment. In particular, I want to focus my remarks on the Drought Communities Program, which sits in the Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development Portfolio. This is a drought funding communities program which, in essence, recognises that, as farmers go through drought, the communities that exist around them are also experiencing economic hardship. Over various governments, there has been some form of recognition that we do need to try and support the economies and jobs of those communities. But what is really disappointing—and we found this out in the last couple of days, through Senate estimates—is that not all councils are equal when it comes to the Drought Communities Program. I think there is a very serious issue with the way in which this program is being administered, the way in which decisions are being taken and the way in which councils are able to either get into the program or not get into the program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we understand it, as the current measures stand, there are about 123 councils that are eligible. During the election campaign, 14 councils were deemed eligible under this program. They may well be exactly in the circumstances we're talking about, but we heard in Senate estimates yesterday—and there is not a lot of transparency around this—that one of the measures that is being applied to whether councils are eligible or not is not only rainfall data but also the number of workers who are involved in the agricultural workforce; it has to be at around 17 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At Senate estimates we heard about the ridiculous circumstance of the shire of Moyne being deemed eligible for this funding and being offered $1 million, but they were out in the media saying: 'We are actually saying we think we've got enough rainfall at the moment. We feel a bit guilty about accepting this money, because we think there are other council areas in more trouble than we are.' That's not to say that parts of their shire aren't in trouble, but they were saying very clearly: 'We think there are people doing it much tougher than we are. How come we're getting this million dollars?' Then there was the example of the shire of Moira, in the member for Nicholls's electorate, which just fell short of the workforce figure—16.9 per cent. When you look at the workforce, that could potentially be, according to a spokesperson from the shire itself, a handful of workers—five people. It might have been because people had to leave the sector because the jobs weren't there due to the drought. This seems to me to be a very passing-strange way of administering this sort of program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think, when we start to look at some of the things for councils being funded under this program, that the minister needs to pay some attention to this. I understand—others may not—that the government wants to use the program to, hopefully, provide some opportunity for better economic development—so, if it's in the tourism sector, trying to get people into the communities so that there are still jobs and that the economy is still going in those communities. But, when I look at the list of some of the projects that the department provided us on Monday—I am very happy to be corrected on this—I'm not convinced that toilets at Bourke Cemetery are actually economic drivers for jobs and growth in that region; I'm not sure about that. I'm not sure that toilets at a skate park are either. I think they're important, and I think it's great that you get toilets at a skate park, but I'm not sure that these were the sorts of things envisaged under the Drought Communities Program. We haven't seen a public media statement about this, but, as a result of some Channel Nine media inquiries, there was a report on Channel Nine that the government is now reviewing local government eligibility for this program. There has been, as far as I have seen, no media release or statement from the minister that this is actually a problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have got here is a government basically using this program with 14 councils during the election campaign—none of which are in Labor seats, I have to say, and there are definitely Labor seats that are drought affected. We had this program announced in the context of the election. It's a good election announcement to say, 'We are going to give your council $1 million in funds for community facilities.' We have got areas like Shoalhaven, and some of the areas in the member for Hunter's electorate, saying that they think they should meet the eligibility criteria as well—and places like Kiama as well. You have to say that this government has politicised this program, and it needs to clean it up—particularly in a context where we have communities that are severely affected by drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has tried to talk a big game about drought funding. The problem it has is that it has been asleep at the wheel. We are in this government's seventh year. The drought didn't just happen yesterday, or a week ago, or a month ago; we are in a long period of extended drought. The government basically cut and stopped much of the work that Labor had started in government: trying to actually look at drought mitigation strategies, trying to connect water infrastructure, trying to look at the way in which you would reform, trying to look at the way in which drought declarations and the partnerships between states and territories are made. It basically stopped doing any of that work because it had this principle that anything Labor did was bad, and therefore they couldn't do it, rather than actually thinking there was some good in it and they should just continue it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has talked this game—'We've got $7 billion that we're spending on drought!'—which is simply and utterly not true. The government has taken $3.9 billion out of the Building Australia Fund, the infrastructure fund, which in fact it could have used for drought mitigation infrastructure if it got through the Infrastructure Australia process. It could've been using that money anyway. It's taken that and put that into a fund that will, over time, grow to $5 billion, and it will then draw down on the interest of that fund to the tune of $100 million a year. That is not a $7 billion drought program; that a $5 billion program, the interest of which will go to drought affected communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again I say, supporting this second reading amendment, the government needs to actually look very seriously about what its drought policy is. In particular, it needs to look at what it is actually giving directly to farm households—it is in this bill, but also a number of people are coming off farm household assistance—and how that's working. More broadly, it needs to look at our preparedness and how we are actually managing drought—in particular, in my portfolio area, the Drought Communities Program. I look forward to seeing—the minister is at the table—the terms of reference of the review of the Drought Communities Program. I look forward to seeing whether it is just a review to try to say, 'We've got a local council in the member for Nicholls' area that probably should be eligible, so how do we make it eligible?' It looks to me, from the administration of the program, that this is a significant failure. If the government has politicised the program in the way that it looks on paper after the evidence of Senate estimates, frankly, they should be ashamed of themselves.</span>

                    <a href="72184" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  I rise to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Relief Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2019. We all realise how important food is to our nation. Our farmers feed our nation and they feed at least 60 to 80 million people overseas as well. At times of severe drought, that importance is thrust into national prominence. Since 2014, we have realised that, being involved in agriculture at this time with increasing costs of water, electricity, fodder and feed—all the costs that go into producing food and fibre for our nation have increased—if the markets and the value of the goods increase, it's well and good, but there are many times, like now, where the cycle is against you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everything is clustering against farmers who are in drought affected areas. They are unable to grow the crops or the pastures or support the animals because of physical lack of water. It's not just irrigation that's been brought into the spotlight; it's dairy farming, it's cattle production—all the things that we have been taking for granted. With the severity of this drought at this time, many branches of coastal rivers—you see plenty of water in them, but most of it is salty until you get up into the hinterlands. Some of the branches of these coastal rivers in my electorate have turned in a chain of ponds, rather like the Murray and the Darling have over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Farm Household Support Amendment (Relief Measures) Bill (No.1) 2019 is equally as important at this time because of the intersection of all these escalating costs generated by the drought. It's not just a drought program. As I said, being involved in agriculture, you're on very long cycles. When it's good it's very good but, when it's bad, you have to have incredible resilience. There are many people who are resilient, who have been excellent farmers and who have done what they could, but they have no income—and they haven't had income for many years. That's why the farm household allowance was increased in 2014, and, as the minister has said, we are now taking the next step to offer support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The farm household allowance is virtually the same as Newstart. For those who qualify, couples get $1,000 a fortnight and individuals get just over $500 a fortnight. This is not charity; this is what everyone else in Australia gets if they're unemployed. It shouldn't be seen as charity. It's delivering to people who need it when they need it most. We've changed the criteria to make it more accessible to more people, given the situation that we find ourselves in now. The assets that the payments are judged against were upgraded earlier. On 1 July, the asset limit went up to $5 million. It started at a much smaller number, but that increased figure will allow farmers with mid-size farms to access it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that we have adjusted is the amount of non-farm income that can be offset against losses. It used to be $80,000 but has now been increased to $100,000, which gives a much better idea of the true net position of a farming enterprise. We have also tried to make it easier by reducing the amount of paperwork, from about 30 pages down to 17 pages. A lot of farmers have partners who are involved in the same business, and now only one set of paperwork for those partners will be required—so you're not duplicating the red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also changed the amount of farm household allowance from four years worth of farm household allowance in a lifetime to four years out of 10, which is much more generous and much more realistic—because most farmers are in the industry for their lifetime and many of them have seen droughts before. I remember the 1982-83 drought. It was devastating. Many good farmers walked off the land at that time. Hopefully, this measure will keep really good farmers involved in agriculture for a lot longer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The farm household allowance will provide support for the basic necessities of life when the asset that they have developed is sitting there not earning income—just costing them income. We've allowed them to offset the forced sale of their stock as long as they put it into a farm-managed deposit account within six weeks of the forced dispersal or sale of goods and stock. So we've tried to help in as many ways as possible. There's also an ancillary payment of $1,500 to allow them to get financial advice. There are rural financial counsellors who will help them do that for free. They have been doing a great job, and demand is up. We've put more money into rural financial counsellors as well. There is also an incentive to diversify and do business analysis, do extra training and learn extra skills to increase their sustainability and build their resilience—to the tune of $4,000 during the period that they are receiving the farm household allowance. So we're not just giving a cash payment; we're trying to strengthen their business position during the time that they're receiving support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The relief payment is the other important thing in this bill. We are adding a relief payment for those people who have struck the four-year barrier: $13,000, effectively, for a couple, or $7,000 or so for a single person. There are many who have argued for more. If the situation changes, we will always keep a watching brief to see what is required. But this bill definitely receives my support, because we do need to keep our really amazing Australian farmers in the business of producing food and fibre for our nation. As I said, it's not charity. It's just doing what we do for anyone who finds themselves unemployed with no income.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  Farmers make a unique contribution to the prosperity and wellbeing of our nation. They do so under extraordinary conditions and family sacrifices, often subjected to unpredictable weather, fluctuating commodity prices, long hours of hard work, pests, disease, and, more often than not, heavy financial burdens. Not surprisingly, I believe most Australians are sympathetic with the struggles of farmers and are supportive of assistance programs that enable farmers to get through hard times. With continuously changing weather patterns, those hard times are likely to be longer and more frequent. We're already seeing more frequent and more extreme weather events, precisely as predicted by climate scientists, yet the Morrison government does not even have a comprehensive climate change policy. They often talk about climate change commitments, but when you delve deeply into their policies, the reality is that you see very, very little.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, the Farm Household Support Amendment (Relief Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2019, can, in fact, be directly attributed to a changing climate. Without continued financial assistance into the future, farmers are going to find it more and more difficult to make ends meet. Under this legislation, farmers will be eligible for 4.5 years of farm household support in every 10-year cycle. Originally, farmers were eligible for three years of support in a lifetime. That was probably a reasonable proposition at the time that the policy came into effect, but times have changed and, in particular, the climate has changed. The three years was subsequently increased to four years and the four years is now being topped up with a six-month lump-sum payment of $7,500 for a single recipient, or $6,500 each for couples, which means it's effectively a 4½ year support program. I note that the payments are not subjected to the government's shameful robo-debt program. I welcome that, but it does expose the Morrison government's double standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For some farmers, the increased assistance will not be enough. We're hearing calls from the National Farmers' Federation for more drought assistance, including farm exit packages. Farming in Australia has always been risky, but when calls are being made for farm exit packages, that implies a crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Monday night I spoke in this place about the long-term sustainability of the Murray-Darling Basin, which, again, is a matter I have spoken about in this place on many occasions, and which has been the subject of parliamentary debate in this place for over a decade now. Yet we still have a situation where the insecurity hanging over farmers in the Murray-Darling Basin is as bad as it ever was.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is irresponsible for governments to wait until a crisis is upon them before they act. By that stage, the financial and social cost to communities is traumatic. My understanding is that, since 2014, farm household allowances have assisted over 10,000 people. As at the end of 2018, just over 5,000 people were still receiving support. We also heard yesterday in question time that around 600 recipients had had their payments ended, and a further 500 will have payments terminated by Christmas. It seems incredibly short-sighted and callous—in a worsening drought period, with calls for increased assistance coming from so many sectors—to end farmers' government assistance payments. I simply cannot understand that logic. I would have thought that this would be a time where, if anything, we would be going in the opposite direction—yet we are not, under this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when farmers are struggling financially, it affects whole communities and industry sectors. We just heard the member for Ballarat talking about the Drought Communities Program. Government assistance should not ignore the impact of drought on the workers and small and medium-sized businesses who depend on farming for their own survival. For them, the effects of drought are just as direct as they are for the farmers themselves. Those small and medium-sized businesses and the workers who work for them may not be farmers, but they are also affected by the drought, and their struggles, unfortunately, are all too often ignored. Then we see the social consequences of that, with many of them, whether they are business people or ordinary families, ending up in a financial mess, seeking help from support services, which they quite often can't get access to, and the like. In fact, I suspect that one of the reasons we have so many social problems in many country areas is because of the struggles of the farmers as a result of the climatic conditions and the like, which then flow on to the communities around them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other matter of real concern that has been raised in this place in recent months is the issue of the way banks have operated across this country. The government did finally agree to a royal commission into the banks, but the truth of the matter is that it only agreed to that reluctantly. It did so under pressure. One of the issues that farmers across this country have continuously struggled with is the way they have been treated by their banks. Not only did the government agree to the royal commission reluctantly—in fact, from my memory, it voted against it some 26 times—but even now it does not follow through on the recommendations of that royal commission nor ensure that the interest rate cuts that have been handed down by the Reserve Bank of Australia are passed on in full to the farmers. That's one of the measures that directly has an effect on the viability of farmers across this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal government has been in office for over six years. It claims to be a friend of Australian farmers. But that is a very shallow claim. I've just spoken about the greedy banks gouging farmers and causing some of them to lose their farms, but it's more than just that, when you look at the track record of this government. The banks are just one example. I said earlier that this is a government that doesn't have a policy with respect to climate change. Climate change will mean that there will be more devastation, whether it is in the form of longer or more frequent droughts, or in the form of floods or tornadoes and the like. We know that drought has been one of the issues that this country has had to grapple with, particularly in the last two decades—and, I believe, more so than ever before. We hear this government constantly talking about building more dams. They've been in office for six years, and I'm not aware of one single new dam being built. So it's one thing to talk about having a policy and a strategy and to make promises to people to try to suggest that the government is responding to the needs of the farming community, but it's another to actually see what they are doing when they're actually doing nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said earlier that I spoke about the Murray-Darling Basin only a couple of days ago. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan is now in shambles. Over two million Australians live within the Basin, mainly farming communities, and I see no clear direction for those farmers in that plan. We heard in recent days about the response to the dairy industry and how it's caused a major problem within the National Party, the junior coalition member of this government. In fact, I understand that, as a result of some suggested changes to the dairy industry that ought to be made, the National Party has its own leadership crisis to contend with. This is a government that has been in office for six years and it hasn't dealt with the dairy industry. We have absolutely absurd claims that farmers are being forced to compete with mining companies for water. There is no way that most farmers can compete with mining companies for water and pay the kinds of prices that the mining companies are prepared to pay. It's not a level playing field anymore, and the farmers will simply not be able to compete on that basis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also heard other speakers today, time and time again, say this is a government that does not even have a drought policy. In a country that relies so heavily on farming in climactic conditions that make farming so insecure, it is incredible that Australia does not have a drought policy. What we have is a government that has a knee-jerk response to each crisis as it arises. Talk of a drought policy by referring to a $5 billion or $7 billion drought fund is absolutely meaningless when, as the member for Ballarat also quite rightly pointed out, that's not the amount of money that is being made available to farmers across this country to assist them through a drought period. In fact, that to me is shameful dishonesty on the part of the government—to purport to be supporting farmers with that fund—when we know that all the farmers get out of it is the interest that that fund accrues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last issue I will touch on with respect to how this government has ignored farming communities is the government's failure to provide decent health services and get health professionals into farming communities and regional parts of Australia. This is a government that has had six years to fix the rural health crisis and it has failed to do so. When farming communities are struggling because of drought or other climactic issues, of course they will need health services to a higher degree than at other times yet, again, we see reports in the media today and I hear stories on a regular basis about how accessing health services in regional Australia is becoming more and more difficult. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition has moved an amendment to this legislation and I will be supporting that amendment. In summary, many members of this government represent the very communities that are going to be affected the most by the drought. I would have thought that they would have been in touch with their communities more so than other members in this place because they represent them. And yet, in the last six years that they have been in government, I have seen farming communities struggle from one crisis to another and I don't see a cohesive strategy to deal with that. We had the National Farmers' Federation come to Canberra yesterday, I believe—that's what the reports say—and speak to the Prime Minister and to other senior ministers. It took the National Farmers' Federation to bring the whole notion of a policy or of a strategy to deal with drought to the government. It should have been the other way around. This is not a new concept, and it should have been the government that led in respect of establishing a national strategy to deal with drought. The situation, in my view, is going to get worse in the years ahead of us. I say that because I have faith in the science. If that is the case, I don't want to see our farming communities struggle, because, as I said in my opening remarks, the farming community is essential to the prosperity and wellbeing of this nation. We need to ensure it remains that way, and that will happen only if we have a national drought strategy.</span>

To have an open-door policy; to have lines of communication with the NFF, who are the peak association for our agricultural sector; to have them develop a policy that is most pertinent and appropriate for the struggle of each particular sector—that is what we as a government need. We need open lines of communication to every peak association within the agricultural sector. Let those peak associations design the support packages for what is best for each of their areas and bring those support packages to government, so we can assist in the way the industry thinks is most appropriate, not in the way that some group of politicians who have had a brain snap think might be best for the sector. It's what this government has been very good at doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Farm Household Allowance is not just about drought. In fact my first example of the Farm Household Allowance came just prior to the election in 2016, when the milk price collapsed and clawbacks were put in place by two of our major processors, claiming that they had overpaid our dairy farmers. They were demanding that hundreds of thousands of dollars be repaid to them. The Farm Household Allowance was the mechanism we used to support farmers through that time. This support package we have in place needs to be adaptable under different circumstances. We never envisaged that this would then run on into an ongoing drought; however, now that it has, and farmers are getting hit from one area to another, it is appropriate that we broaden the qualifying criteria and make it more accessible to more farmers.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what we've done. We've lifted the off-farm income test from $80,000 up to $100,000. That's very important. We've lifted the assets that you're allowed to have tied up in the value of your farm from $3 million up to $5 million. We've extended the time you're allowed to be on Farm Household Allowance firstly from three years out to four years in a lifetime and then made it even more accessible by making it four years in any 10. This support has been broadened and expanded. We now have the exit packages so that, as people do transition off Farm Household Allowance, they have the one-off payments of $7,000 or $13,000, plus a little bit. These are some of the things that are really important for our people. But, before we think that putting in place support packages is enough for our people, it's not. It's more important that we first look at policy opportunities and ways we can further assist our farmers during times of hardship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're in the southern Murray-Darling Basin areas, this all pertains to water policy. Are we doing everything we possibly can with water policy to enable our farmers to farm? It's good to hear the previous speaker, representing the Labor Party, suggest that we should be doing more in relation to building dams. That's very refreshing—that we're getting criticised by the Labor Party for not doing enough in relation to building dams! We would like that sentiment to be echoed throughout Queensland. We would love that sentiment from the Labor Party to be pushed harder throughout Victoria. It's good to see that the New South Wales government have come on board to partner with the federal government to build dams in New South Wales. But, if that's the stance of the Labor Party, then we're very happy that they have taken that view. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have to look at other ways of getting water to farmers. In the Murray River and the Goulburn River areas of Victoria, this might mean looking at using environmental water in dry years in the way that it was first explained to the Australian people under John Howard, when he had the view of putting together a national strategic plan instead of just this ad hoc arrangement where various governments around Australia were rushing off to buy indiscriminate parcels of water. Therefore, Prime Minister Howard at the time thought we needed to put some strategy around it, instead of these indiscriminate buybacks. When we put this strategy around it and put together a plan where water is taken out of agriculture and put into the environment, in dry years we should make allowances for that water to be returned to agriculture to enable farmers to farm. If we enable farmers to farm by using water in a more flexible manner, we're not going to need to supply farm household allowance to a whole range of farmers, because they're going to be able to fend for themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is very critical piece of support that the government is putting in place. Minister Littleproud, the minister for water resources and drought, is talking very clearly about a three-pronged strategy that we as a government are adopting. That is about providing, here and now, farm household support, and low-interest loans that have the capacity to save farmers in the vicinity of $30,000 per annum. We have farm household allowance, which is in the vicinity of $26,000 a year over a four-year period—that is, over $100,000. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A large proportion of the farmers who have transitioned out of farm household allowance have indicated that it made a significant difference to their ability to stay in the farming sector. After transitioning out—hopefully, on the back of a couple of good years and profitability returning to their business—they've been able to look back and reflect that the farm household allowance came to them at a very crucial time and was a major reason they were able to stay in agriculture. There is no doubt that this program has had wide-ranging impacts. Over 12,700 farmers have been part of the Farm Household Allowance Program. That has cost over $365 million during that period up to 4 October 2019. There has also been an additional $44 million for supplementary payments in recognition of the severity of this drought. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This program has been absolutely crucial to the ongoing viability of our people, certainly in my electorate of Nicholls. All of them would rather not be on this program. All of them have expressed some frustration with the complexity of getting the FHA—and we were able to acknowledge that, and it's a positive thing that the applications process has been, effectively, cut in half. It is still regarded in the same light as welfare support, even though we understand that it is entirely different. But the process of gaining this financial assistance does mean that we ask people to jump through a lot of hoops and provide an awful amount of their financial positions and financial structures. I understand that many farms are set up with trust arrangements, and this does add complexity to the process of being assessed for the farm household allowance. We do ask that people do not self-assess. We understand there are rural financial counsellors out there, who are prepared to help, and we understand that every member of this House is also prepared to help farmers in their patch, in any way they can, with their application for the farm household allowance. It is something that has been incredibly valuable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also need to re-stress this issue: that right now, this drought tightens its grip on our agricultural sector and our farmers and our farming communities. The point that's been well made is that this is not just about the farmers; this is about the communities that support our farming sector. Certainly in my electorate many of these small communities have been built around the dairy industry and, to a lesser extent, the fruit growing regions of the Goulburn Valley. So these communities are also the beneficiaries when it comes to giving people the farm household allowance to enable them to put food on their table and have that little bit of money swim around the community, which, in fact, it does. We have to stay fully committed to our farming communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I need to reinforce that, before we look at some of the things the NFF are talking about—that is, exit packages and maybe reskilling programs—we have to look under every rock and every hollow log to see if there's another way that we can actually help our farmers. If we happen to find an opportunity to assist with water policy and we are able to become more flexible with the water that currently exists within the agriculture sector, the investor pool or the environmental pool, then I think we owe it to our farmers to put the politics aside and look at the ways we can make water available to our farming sector in these incredibly dry times. If we come into this place and say that we all support our farmers and want to do everything we can to help them and then turn our back on them because we're not prepared to give them an opportunity to access the water that's flowing past their doors, flowing past their paddocks then we are simply politicians with hollow words. We have an opportunity to act in the Southern Basin. We have an opportunity to do something to help our farming sector. Everyone in this House has to have a genuine think about if it's just hollow words of support for our drought-affected farmers or if we actually want to change water policy to give them the water they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Victoria right now, another element has been thrown into this, and this is the proposal that's been put forward to build another dam—that is, to turn little buffalo into big buffalo, which will effectively grow the size of buffalo dam by about 25 times. This is something that could lead to over a thousand gigalitres of water being held in storage. Again, this is something the Victorian government needs to come on board for and be supportive of. This is another way that we can capture more water in the heavy rainfall events and deliver it to Lake Nillahcootie to supply not just Victorian farmers but also South Australia and New South Wales with a more secure supply of water. Surely this is a project that needs to be looked at and examined. If it stacks up, then we need to see the funding flow and we need to see state governments prepared to get off their backsides and get to work and create further water storages to help our drought-affected farmers through these very, very troubling times.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  I rise to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Relief Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2019. The drought may feel a long way away for city dwellers, but for many people in my electorate of Macquarie, on the fringe of Sydney, it's very close to home. We might be only 70 kilometres from Sydney's CBD, but we have around 500 businesses in the agricultural sector employing around 1,000 people between them. That includes cattle producers, orchardists and vegetable and produce growers. We've also got Western Sydney University and the Hawkesbury campus, with its focus on agriculture and innovation in agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This drought, which people are saying will soon be the worst drought since European settlement, impacts in a number of ways. It impacts directly on local farmers who are coping with less water and higher costs; that is affecting their production and their profitability. It affects the businesses that supply those farmers, who are much less likely to be upgrading tractors and equipment in difficult times and are cutting costs where they can. It flows on through the whole local economy. When you drive past paddocks and dams every day, there's also greater awareness. Of course, everyone appreciates that things are so much tougher across the ranges. There's certainly nothing much positive coming from forecasters about rain throughout summer, and there is therefore huge empathy for the farming communities who are suffering. The government didn't need to spend $190,000 on an empathy plan to make that happen, as it did with the Inland Rail project; people do understand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is real sympathy for the plight of farmers and little sympathy for a government that likes taking photos with farmers but whose claims on drought funding sometimes just don't stack up. I think the best example of that is this: the Prime Minister keeps banging on about his $7 billion drought package, but we've learned that $5 billion of that is locked away in a fund for another 10 years and that only $100 million is going to be spent per year—so it's a $100 million amount, not a $5 billion amount, to be spent. And the other $2 billion is actually loans. I really think the Prime Minister has to be a bit more up-front about what is actually being provided to people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've listened with interest to Senate estimates on the Future Drought Fund. It's designed to fund research and other things that are really worthwhile doing; there is no doubt about it. But it's not actually providing immediate support to farmers and their communities, and it won't start until 1 July next year. So the question has to be asked: what are people going to do until then? That is why we will be supporting these extensions and improvements to the farm household support program, because they are terribly needed. But this isn't enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons some communities are missing out on drought funding is that they don't have quite enough people involved in agriculture. I was stunned to hear that the formula that is applied is being applied so rigorously. You're required to have a minimum of 17 per cent of your community employed in agriculture. There are communities all around Australia that are dreadfully drought affected, but they're missing out on funding because they have only 16.9 per cent of their population employed in agriculture. We need communities' needs to be understood, not an inflexible percentage to be placed. The government really needs to think about how to make the support packages that they have available and accessible. We support this increase in farm assistance, because we believe there are people who need immediate support. But we also need longer-term planning and action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> In terms of immediate support, it is extraordinary how my community have stepped up to provide immediate support where they see a need. Groups like Hawkesbury Hay Runners, set up by Dan Naethuys and Josh Stephenson, are contributing to the immediate response. Earlier this year their volunteer truck drivers delivered 50 round bales to Moree, to help out, and they've been collaborating with Animal Welfare League NSW to provide some hands-on practical support. City Slickers Appeal, another Hawkesbury charity, has been active for around 18 months after Wade and a group of Ebenezer friends realised that they could help, that there was something they could do. Their work was recognised in a Hawkesbury Australia Day award earlier this year. When I spoke to Wade, he said that he realised just how hard things were in the bush and he simply wanted to show country people that city slickers did actually care about what was happening past the mountains. Ever since then, Wade and his team have been going about their business, just trying to help as many communities and farmers as they can, delivering bales, food and all sorts of supplies regularly to the bush. They're well supported by the very generous Hawkesbury community in which they live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are people who can see there is more to be done, in spite of the Prime Minister's claims that it's all under control. In the absence of rain, a promised dam just ain't gonna cut it. Dams are great when it is raining, but we're kind of beyond that point. What we're missing is a comprehensive approach to tackling the impacts of the current drought and then a longer-term plan to manage the changing conditions that farmers are clearly facing. The National Farmers' Federation thinks there needs to be a plan. The Nationals think there needs to be a plan. It's just that the government can't quite see that things are at a point where in fact you do need to reach out and work with a whole range of people. Guess what? That includes working with us, across this parliament, to put a long-term strategy in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things we need to see is the report by the Coordinator-General for Drought, Major General Stephen Day, which the Prime Minister refuses to release. That is mind-boggling. He tells us it's the basis for the decisions government is making, yet we're not privy to what is in that report. Keeping secret the reports you receive isn't a way to work collaboratively or for there to be any confidence in the decisions the government is making; nor is bluffing your way through by saying, 'We're doing heaps,' when those on the ground are having a very different experience. That's why we've proposed a drought cabinet, modelled on the war cabinets chaired by Menzies, Curtin and Churchill, creating a forum that allows decisions to be made on a bipartisan basis. These are dark days for farmers and the farming communities that rely on them. That's also going to flow through to every person who buys food. It's only a matter of time before the crunch is really felt. We can't wait for that point. This situation goes beyond what we've seen in the past with drought and requires a comprehensive and urgent response now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will address one final point. It's often said by those on the other side that our side doesn't understand the bush and farming communities. That claim is made often, as are many others that are simply not based on any evidence or fact. I put on the record that when I was a small-business operator my very first client was NSW Farmers. This was back in the 1990s. For 25 years in the course of working in my business as a media and presentation consultant I was privileged to work with a multitude of agricultural businesses. Sometimes they came to me because things were really tough in their sector and they needed help; at other times things were going great guns and they wanted to spread the word on what they were doing and needed some skills to do that. What it gave me was the opportunity to really see inside some of these bigger agricultural businesses and smaller producers, the individuals who were there working on their properties. I think it does this parliament a disservice that those opposite think they have all the knowledge about farming and rural communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are parts of my community which you look at and think, 'This is absolutely remote wilderness.' There are other parts where you think, 'This is rural agriculture.' I really urge those opposite: work with us. We do have some knowledge and understanding, and, what's more, we have the goodwill to find a way through this very difficult problem, which is not your problem alone; it's our country's problem, and it's something where we should all be working together to find a resolution. There has been a lot of talk about what the solutions might be for the best way to come to an agreement on is, because nothing is going to happen in a single term of parliament. Anything that really will make a difference in the long run is going to require ongoing support. You can't have governments chopping and changing at will. I urge you to set your pride aside and come and work with us. We really want to help. We have Australia's best interests at heart.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I'd like to briefly thank the member for Macquarie for that excellent speech and I would like to echo her sentiments. We remain ready on this side of the parliament to stand with the government to address the drought crisis affecting farmers across our nation. The member for Hunter and the Leader of the Opposition have proposed a 'drought war cabinet'—a joint effort to address this issue. That offer stands ready. It continues. Let's work together as a parliament, united, to address this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Relief Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2019, and the amendment moved by the member for Hunter, as a representative of farmers who are battling drought, principally on the east coast of my electorate. It may surprise some in this place, but Tasmania does experience drought. I know the pretty pictures show we're an island of green and lush mountains and beautiful rainforests, but the east coast of my electorate and of the state is dry, and it's been dry for years. We've had record low rainfall and farmers are struggling. Farmers on the east coast of my electorate are haemorrhaging money as they try to prop up their businesses and feed their livestock. Their mental and physical wellbeing is being undermined. They are desperately worried for their future. I've met with several of them in recent months and attended a drought awareness community meeting in Cranbrook as recently as a few weeks ago. Cranbrook is on the east coast of my electorate, smack bang in the middle of the driest region in Tasmania. From what I heard when I spoke one-on-one to farmers and others at the meeting, it was clear to me that these people, this community, are hurting, and hurting badly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania is a state of microclimates. That's fairly normal. The west coast has always received much more rainfall than the east. But this year the extremes were amplified. On the west coast, the town of Strahan—some members may be familiar with it and with its rainforests—had a record high winter rainfall. The east coast had the opposite. It's hard to believe how extreme the extremes can be in a state that is geographically so small. The west coast had record high rainfall and the east coast had record low rainfall.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is welcome. It increases the time for which a person affected by drought can access farm household allowance from a maximum four years over their lifetime to four years in each specified 10-year period. It introduces an expanded off-farm income offset, broadening the circumstances in which it can be applied and increasing the upper threshold from $80,000 to $100,000. Finally, it will serve to introduce a one-off lump sum payment to those who have exhausted the allowed days of the allowance by July 2020. These are certainly good initiatives. Any support given to those living with drought is noble. But let me be clear: it's not sufficient, it isn't sustainable and it will have no impact on the broader issues, which the government seems to be ignoring. In Little Swanport, on the east coast, wool producer Stuart has been destocking and feeding sheep since May. He reports he has spent more than $50,000 on feed. If rainfall does not increase, Stuart is going to have to destock further and keep only his breeding stock. It will take him years to recover. Closer to Cranbrook, on Steph's cattle and sheep property only two of the 20 waterholes contain water. She reports that over the past five years the region has experienced less than half its annual rainfall—2014, she reports, was the driest in 118 years. Down the road, Alan, who also farms sheep, acknowledges the persistence of the dry. 'It's just hung on. There's no break in between,' he told the ABC last November.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the south-east of my electorate it was reported in August this year that Bangor Vineyard's Matt Dunbabin, a former Australian Farmer of the Year, is having to invest in a $100,000 10-kilometre pipeline simply to ensure that his grapevines continue to have a reliable source of water. It's expensive and a lot of work but cheaper than letting his grapevines die. The reality is that farmers across Lyons and across Australia are experiencing similar situations. There is no rain. There is no water. There is no let-up from the dry, the extreme weather conditions and the drought.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has stated several times that the drought is his top priority. He acknowledges the severity of it, the implications of it. He has a minister for drought. Previously he had a drought envoy. We still have not seen the reports or the results of that expensive, nonsensical marketing exercise that was generated—it seems clear now—only for a headline. We have seen nothing in public about what the drought envoy was supposed to have achieved.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Drought is not a new phenomenon to Australia. Our farmers and rural and regional communities have always had to contend with the realities of fickle and extreme weather, and it was always projected they would continue to be a prominent feature of Australian weather. What was not expected, however, was the consistency of this drought or just how extreme it has been. In May last year, a paper was published by the University of Melbourne in collaboration with the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science. This paper demonstrates that Australia's recent drought experiences could be the worst drought seen on the continent in 800 years. The broader problem is that Australia does not just have to face the challenges caused by drought. There is also blistering heat. The lack of rainfall has created an environment susceptible to bushfires, and low dam reservoirs and extreme temperatures mean we are not in a position to combat them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parts of my electorate not known for being overly dry—the Derwent Valley and the Central Highlands, which in winter are covered in snow as often as not—were ravaged by bushfires earlier this year. More than 200,000 hectares of land was burned, including some of our state's most sensitive and unique natural areas. Vegetarian that has evolved over millennia went up in flames. In May 2018, many Tasmanian regions, including our capital city of Hobart and another part of the Derwent Valley—not the part that was hit by bushfire—were hit by floods, causing widespread damage and costing councils millions of dollars.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the world, we are seeing record-breaking temperatures and extreme weather becoming more frequent and more normal. This summer might well be the hottest summer in 100 years, but we need to change the way we think. We shouldn't be thinking that this is the hottest summer in 100 years but should realise that it could well be the coolest in the next 100 years. Our farmers are resilient, optimistic and adaptable, but there is only so much they can do in the wake of these experiences. The science, the data, the mapping and the research all show that our weather is going to get hotter, it's going to be drier and there will be more extreme weather events—more floods, more fires, more droughts. It's likely to be even more unpredictable in the years ahead.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Government needs to step up, take responsibility and do more to help those who are affected by the drought. While this bill certainly provides some assistance, it is not enough. I go to the member for Macquarie's statements and those of the member for Hunter. The government has made much of the $7 billion drought fund. Not one cent of $7 billion goes to farmers. We on this side don't argue against the merits a drought fund, about the $100 million to be drawn down in future years for drought infrastructure. We don't argue about the need for that or about the good sense in drought infrastructure, but stop telling farmers that it's for them. It doesn't help farmers on the ground and it certainly does not help farmers who are affected by drought right now, today. Not one cent of it goes to farmers, so stop telling farmers that this is a drought fund for them.</span>

Around 10,000 Tasmanians are directly employed in agriculture and contribute about a third of gross state product.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Agriculture affects a lot of people in Tasmania—a lot of communities—and a lot of them are vulnerable to increasing temperatures and unpredictable, extreme weather. The fact is that the government have no plan for drought. Despite the minister, despite the envoy, despite the coordinator-general and despite all the research, they have no plan, they have no strategy. The backbench Nationals know there's no policy. They're sick of waiting to see one from their colleagues on the front bench. They're revolting, in more ways than one. Six years ago, the Liberals and the Nationals came to government and the first thing they did was abolish the Standing Council on Primary Industries, a formal body of the Council of Australian Governments. Under the last Labor government, the federal and state governments and the National Farmers' Federation all agreed that existing drought architecture was deficient and we needed a coordinated national action plan. That was more than six years ago. The first thing the Liberals and the Nationals did upon coming to government, led then by Tony Abbott, the former member for Warringah, and his deputy, the current member for New England, was to abolish this COAG process. What a different place we would be in today if that process had been allowed to continue. We would have a nationally agreed drought plan.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where is the report from Major General Stephen Day? He was appointed in a blaze of headlines to be the national coordinator for drought. Major General Day did his job. He produced a report, with recommendations, that he has provided to the Prime Minister, but where is it? It's collecting dust on the Prime Minister's desk. Why won't the Prime Minister release the Day report? Why won't he allow it to be discussed and debated? The Prime Minister's addiction to secrecy is causing uncertainty in the community, and others are filling the vacuum. In the absence of substantive drought action from the government, others are calling for a national drought plan. The NFF put its own ideas for one to the government earlier this week. Farmers for Climate Action are calling for a national climate change strategy, because, as we know, it would be foolish to have a drought plan that does not include a climate change action plan.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The discussion around climate and worsening weather should not be ideologically divided. The effects are real—it's based on science—and we can see them around us every day. The cost to our fellow Australians is real. The cost to the economy is real. Climate change is not about Left and Right. It's not about cities versus regions or latte sippers versus VB chuggers. Climate change affects us all and we must come together as a nation to do something about it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently met with Farmers for Climate Action, a professional movement of farmers, agriculture and primary industry leaders and rural Australians who want to ensure that action is taken on climate change. Farmers are on the front line of climate change and are part of the solution. They must be part of the solution. Farmers for Climate Action work directly with those on the ground to ensure that they have climate literacy. They encourage them to become advocates and teach them innovative and scientifically backed practices to adapt to a changing climate. The work they do is vitally important and the lessons they teach are valuable, but they can only do so much, and they must be listened to. Countries and communities across the world are implementing innovative practices and strategies that serve to alleviate some of the consequences of climate change. In Africa, we have the Great Green Wall, an ambitious project to grow an 8,000-kilometre natural wall of forest to combat climate change and desertification. A decade in and with roughly 15 per cent underway, the project is already restoring Africa's degraded landscapes, providing environmental outcomes, food security and jobs. Elsewhere in Africa, there are other attempts to restore landscapes and encourage water retention. Justdiggit, a Dutch NGO currently active in Kenya and Tanzania, is teaching communities how to modify their landscape through digging, to encourage growth and vegetation restoration, as well as water preservation for subsurface soil.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's growing evidence that forest restoration can encourage rainfall, not only in places where trees already exist but also hundreds of kilometres away. Over the past 200 years, Australia has cut down more than 40 per cent of its forests, leaving a scarred landscape behind. To be clear, I support sustainable logging. I think the Greens' obsessive opposition to the sector is ridiculous. Sawn timber is a terrific carbon sink and a natural product we should make more use of, not less, in the construction of our homes and cities. When we cut down one tree, we should replace it with three, four or five. Some of those replacements should be destined for reharvest and others for reserve or reforestation, either here in Australia or overseas in places like Indonesia, Burma, Malaysia and the Amazon. Forestation is a major part of drought mitigation. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I congratulate the staff and students of Acacia Ridge State School for their week of amazing celebrations marking the school's 150th anniversary last week. Acacia Ridge State School opened on 1 April 1869 with 26 students and one teacher, Miss Fanny Stanbrough. The original school was a basic bark building in dense scrub. The school was originally known as Coopers Plains State School, but the name was changed in July 1956 to Acacia Ridge State School. Today the school has approximately 50 staff and 349 students, with an arts auditorium and a great library. It also has a very popular music program, which includes a glee club. The school had a range of celebrations last week but, as I was down in Canberra, unfortunately I missed most of them. However, I did manage to participate in the 2019 Twilight Ridge Fest on Friday evening and had many locals drop by my stall to tell me their stories about attending the school and even the uniforms they wore. It was great to see so many generations of Ridge residents speak with pride about their school years. I also saw some great school memorabilia on display at the hub, including uniforms, old school cases, desks and inkwells. To the principal, Nicole Collins, the head of curriculum, the indefatigable Tara Griffin, and all the staff and parents at Acacia Ridge State School: thank you for your innovation, your enthusiasm, but, most importantly, your proud dedication to educating and supporting the children of Acacia Ridge, a suburb that my family has had a connection to ever since World War II, when my grandfather started working on the airfield there with the American air force.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  Townsville is a beautiful place to live and such a great place to raise your family. I, like many others, have chosen to stay there after military service, but right now we have a youth crime epidemic under the Palaszczuk catch-and-release program, with no punishment to youth offenders. The state Labor member's inaction is absolutely disgusting. People don't feel safe in their homes; they feel like prisoners. When police come to people's homes during an attempted break-in or when someone has tried to steal their car, they get told, 'Hide your keys.' That is not good enough. It is not the police's fault. The police are working with what they have available; it is the state Labor government that is weak on legislation and weak on crime, something that is affecting our area. Just a few days ago a plane was diverted from landing in Townsville—a helicopter was in the air—because an 11-year-old, a 14-year-old and a 19-year-old went for a joyride and were smashing up the city. People had to get diverted away. You know what Aaron Harper, one of the state members, said? 'Not a crime problem.' Rubbish! He doesn't know his job. There is a problem. Instead of standing up for the people, he's blaming everyone else. State government has responsibility over crime, over boots on the ground for police and over looking after correctional officers. They don't know their job and they need to get better at it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  We're heading into music festival season, and people of all ages will take part. I read with interest the leaked New South Wales coroner's report into festival deaths and pill testing, something I've spoken about in this place previously. As the mother of a musician who has played at music festivals around the world, I've heard about the different approaches taken outside Australia, where they don't face what we do every music festival season. Something's wrong in New South Wales when a government is tone-deaf to the pleas of parents and festivalgoers to allow a trial of medically supervised pill-testing, something's wrong when 16-year-olds are strip-searched and something's wrong when the music festival industry talks about simply leaving the state. It appears the coroner is taking a harm-reduction approach that could actually save lives. New South Wales was brave enough to trial harm minimisation with the safe injecting room in Kings Cross nearly 20 years ago. We really have very little to lose by trying a new approach, because while I, like most mothers, would rather that none of our children took drugs, what is currently happening at music festivals almost guarantees that more tragedies will occur. If the evidence from a trial doesn't support its effectiveness, there's little damage done, but it might mean that someone's brother, girlfriend, daughter or dad who goes to a music festival actually goes home at the end of it. I say to the Premier of New South Wales: business-as-usual is not good enough.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Colin was best known in our community for his work and contribution to education as the founding principal of Rivermount. He also co-founded the Hank Young Foundation for Aboriginal Welfare and Education with his brother. As an educator he also established independent schools in South-East Queensland which have become leading educational institutions. The missions of these schools are a reflection of Colin's dream to foster authentic and inclusive learning communities with a passion for reconciliation and building bridges between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Interestingly, the late Neville Bonner AO was the founding patron of Rivermount College.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born in the Netherlands in 1938, Colin was the son of farmers and inherited his passion for humanitarianism from his humble beginnings. His contribution to our community is ongoing, as his son Richard is now the Principal of Rivermount College. He was a visionary educator, and he will be remembered by all who knew and loved him as a dedicated family man and a wonderful friend and mentor. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  This week we've all been appalled by evidence of the systemic slaughter of racehorses. In response to these revelations, industry bodies have backed a register that tracks every racehorse throughout its life. I'd like to draw the House's attention to this. It's not a new idea and it's one that I think has significant merit. Indeed, the Senate is currently undertaking an inquiry into this very matter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry came about because of the tireless campaigning by two people in my electorate, Juliana and Mark Waugh, who have a deeply personal and incredibly tragic impetus for their mission. On 24 March 2009, their daughter, Sarah, died after falling from a horse during a TAFE course on a basic horseriding and care program. If a national horse register had been in place at the time, the TAFE would have known the horse in question was actually a retired racehorse. They also would have known what the coroner later found, which was that it was patently unsuitable for beginners, the very people who were doing the course, and Sarah Waugh might still be with us today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I await the findings of the Senate inquiry with great interest, but it's clear that there are a number of very good reasons to seriously consider a comprehensive national horse register that tracks horses throughout their lives.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  I rise this afternoon to inform the House of the progress of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Water Resources inquiry into growing Australian agriculture into a $100 billion industry by 2030. As the chair of the committee I'm pleased to say that, due to the exceptional level of interest, the period for submissions has now been extended to 28 November. I know how busy farmers can be, but it's important that everybody gets the opportunity to make their submission and have their voice heard. This inquiry is an excellent opportunity for those in the agriculture sector to raise ideas, or the foreseeable challenges, and help make a difference to the future of our vital industry. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of the inquiry is to identify the right policy settings needed by government to support the industry's efforts to be more productive and take Australia's agriculture to $100 billion and beyond. Future growth in the ag sector will deliver broader social and economic benefits, not just for Australian agriculture but also for the longevity of rural communities, like the countless small towns across my electorate, and the national economy. I've spent my life living and working on the land, and I'm passionate about ensuring Australian agriculture remains strong and sustainable into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the committee chair I look forward to attending public hearings around the country in the future and, in particular, bringing the committee to rural communities such as Mildura, in my colleague the member for Mallee's electorate, and Devonport on 4 and 5 November, and many more rural communities in the year to come. I've spoken to many people since the inquiry was announced and I'm already excited about the ideas being discussed to achieve this $100 billion goal.</span>

Yesterday, I was really angry that the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme got up and told this place that there was no backlog with the NDIS. In my electorate we are—as are, I am sure, many of my colleagues—dealing day after day with people distraught that the NDIS is not delivering on its promise to them, on the back of a $4.6 billion underspend by this government for people with a disability.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm just as angry today, as we've discovered that since 2014 this government has underspent on vocational education and training by nearly a billion dollars. There has been an over $200 million underspend in the current financial year. In my area, young people, people who've been retrenched and people who want to retrain are desperate to get a vocational education and training spot. My TAFEs need funding. My apprenticeships need funding.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government relies on spin instead of investment. Every time I see the Prime Minister speculate that he's going to make a big announcement I don't get my hopes up, because it's all rhetoric and no investment. The last announcement was of an ambassador, Scott Cam. No doubt he's a great guy, but how can you be an ambassador for something that the government is ripping the guts out of and not funding?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  Today I am delighted to give a shout-out to the people of Patchewollock and particularly the music festival team, who put on such a fantastic event last weekend. The festival is in its seventh year and was attended by around a thousand people, boosting the population of Patchewollock considerably from the 2016 census of 113 people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hospitality was pure country—warm and inviting. Deep pit camp ovens baked the food to perfection, and the crowd enjoyed every minute of the top-quality music from the purpose-built Patchewollock stage. The showcase of Aussie and international acts was compelling, with Sara Storer, whose birthplace is not far away, in Wemen; the Missy Raines Trio; Greg Champion; Georgia and Garry Rose and many more.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Highlighting life in the Mallee were the sheep races. I was given the task of officially starting the sheep races—and this, believe me, was a novel experience! A special appearance by Black Caviar—a pink-polka-dot black Dorset sheep from Horsham—was a crowd-pleaser, though her performance was little less than exceptional! I'm not sure that any of the six races achieved track records, but there is always next year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  This week, students from 19 secondary schools across electorate of Mayo begin their final exams. They've been preparing for these exams all year—many would say, for many years—and they've been studying hard for many months, all to prepare for the coming weeks.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many students will be feeling stressed, overwhelmed and very, very tired. So the message I'd like to send to my Mayo year-12ers is: keep working hard, because you're on the home stretch now. But can I ask that you be kind to yourself. One of the things you learn as you grow older is that no one event in your life defines who you are. No matter how you go in your exams, you are much more than a SACE record or your ATAR score. And, although this seems hard to believe, there will come a day when you will look back at this time and smile.</span>

It's particularly opportune that they are here a day after the anniversary of our national apology to victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, because Dassi and Nicole, through their bravery and their courage, have been fighting on behalf of victims of such abuse everywhere. I would like to acknowledge the work of the member for Macnamara and also the member for Isaacs in advocating on this important case of justice that we face.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dassi and Nicole have been here to raise the case of Malka Leifer, an Israeli for whom Australia is seeking extradition. Malka Leifer is facing 74 separate counts of sexual abuse relating to her time as principal of Adass Israel college in Melbourne. We first made the extradition request to Israel five years ago, and, in that time, there have been 60 hearings on this matter, and yet we seem no closer to seeing Malka Leifer extradited to Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not doubt the independence and the integrity of the Israeli judicial system but, surely, enough is enough; it's now time for justice to be done. Israel must be left in no doubt about the importance that Australians attach to this case and the relentlessness with which we will continue to pursue it, in formal and informal channels. I am glad to know that Dassi and Nicole have met the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and other senior figures in the parliament today, and they should be assured that we will not rest until justice is done.</span>

Today, I stand with those still fighting for justice. In the gallery today, we are joined by two outstanding Australians. Dassi Erlich and Nicole Meyer were students at the Adass Israel School in Melbourne when their principal, Malka Leifer, committed the most unholy of acts against them. Ms Leifer fled this country, 11 years ago, when the allegations of horrific acts she committed against her students surfaced. But, despite extradition proceedings commencing against her in 2014 to return her to Victoria, where she is wanted on 74 counts of child sex abuse, Ms Leifer has still not been extradited. There have now been more than 60 court hearings in Israel in this case, including allegations of corrupt ministerial interference, faking mental illness, and a seemingly endless cycle of psychiatric panels.</span>

Dassi and Nicole deserve justice, as do all of Malka Leifer's victims. They deserve to see Malka Leifer returned to Victoria to face justice. Australia has a long, proud history of friendship with the state of Israel but, right now, we ask of our friends one simple request—bring Leifer back.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  It's time Malka Leifer faced justice. Two days after being dismissed by the board of Adass Israel School in Elsternwick, in 2008, Leifer left Australia. Five years later, she was charged with 74 offences of sexual assault related to inappropriate relationships with her pupils in Australia. In 2014, we rightly requested her extradition from Israel to face these charges. Despite being heard nearly 60 times in Israeli courts, this request has not been met five years on. Leifer must face these allegations here in our country. Prolonging a wrong continues the trauma for those in Melbourne's Jewish community. Dassi and Nicole, and others, deserve justice.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, too, endorse the comments of Israel's ambassador to Australia. This case has gone on for far too long and nothing short of full justice can be accepted. Australia has a deep bond with Israel. They are our natural partner in pursuit of justice in the world. What is good for our shared ambitions abroad must be matched at home and lived. Australia has been tolerant in letting the wheels of Israeli justice turn slowly. No longer. Time's up. Bring Leifer here.</span>

The work of that royal commission exposed how widespread the scourge of child sexual abuse extends through our community. In particular, it showed that sexual abuse has been perpetrated in the schools of people of many faiths. Dassi Erlich and Nicole Meyer are here today in the gallery. They suffered sexual abuse when they were students at the Adass Israel School in Melbourne. The principal of the school at that time, Malka Leifer, stands accused of those crimes. But 11 years ago she fled to Israel and remains there to this day as a fugitive from justice, in hiding from justice in the state of Israel.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Israel's Declaration of Independence declares that the state of Israel will 'be based on freedom, justice and peace, as envisaged by the prophets of Israel'. Deuteronomy records that it was Moses who declared as an imperative for the people of Israel: justice, justice shall you pursue—tzedek, tzedek tirdof. It is long past time that Ms Leifer was extradited from Israel to face justice for her horrific crimes, and for Israel to honour its commitment to the rule of law and to justice. I acknowledge the courage of Dassi Erlich, Nicole Meyer and Ellie Sapper in their pursuit of justice. I thank the members for Wentworth, Macnamara and Goldstein for adding their voices to that pursuit.</span>

On Monday, former ADF personnel and their partners will have the chance to enjoy a free visit to the Sunshine Coast's iconic Australia Zoo and to meet the minister for veterans affairs. The men and women of the ADF are courageous, dedicated and highly professional. They work hard and make huge sacrifices to keep us Australians safe, and we owe them a great debt of gratitude.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since my election in 2016, I have tried to honour that contribution in this place by advocating for more action to support veterans as they transition back to civilian life. However, veterans know that simply spending time with mates who understand their service can really help improve their mental health. My Sunshine Coast Veterans Day is designed to give them a great opportunity to do just that. So if you're a veteran on the Sunshine Coast, I'd encourage you to come along, bring your family and enjoy a day out with your fellow service men and women. I want to thank Wes Mannion and the Irwin family and Australia Zoo for agreeing to host my Veterans Day; Dave and Wendy Siebrecht, Brian Machin and Nick Shelley of Glasshouse Country RSL Sub Branch for helping to promote the event; and the Minister for Veterans Affairs, who will join us on the day.</span>

This was a planned question and a planned answer. This is news to everybody across the country. It is certainly news to the families in my electorate who are still waiting for equipment, even though they are already in the system. They are still waiting for wheelchairs. Young Daniel in my electorate has been waiting and waiting and waiting for an electric wheelchair that would match his capacities and his size now. His last wheelchair was from 2002. This minister needs to take responsibility for the state that the NDIS is in, because it has become a farce. The people who are using it believe the system has been designed to frustrate and to disappoint.</span>

I remember the Australian people's support for that. I also remember this government falsely claiming they needed to raise that levy by 0.5 per cent to fund the NDIS, and then we find an underspend in the NDIS.

They have a number of different staff who can help, including doctors, psychologists, youth workers, social workers, drug and alcohol workers, school and work advisers, and counsellors. They provide services to young people who are feeling down, are stressed or can't stop worrying, are having difficulties with school, are concerned about their mental and physical health, are battling drug and alcohol issues, are dealing with family issues, are being bullied or have money problems. Headspace provides tailored mental health support to young people between the ages of 12 and 25, providing support at a crucial time in their lives and helping them to get back on track. We must continue to support organisations such as headspace Caboolture to ensure that young Australians get the help they need now and into the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Parramatta has a speedway—officially known as the Valvoline Raceway. It has been universally loved and sometimes hated by locals for the 42 years that it has been in operation. It is ours—love it or hate it.  On Monday, out of the blue, Barry and Felicity Waldron, who run the raceway, received a phone call from the state government telling them that the speedway is going to be compulsorily acquired to build the yard and operations centre for the Sydney Metro West. I say 'out of the blue', because the Waldrons have been in negotiations for some time about extending their lease—a lease due to expire in 2026. Now they are shutting them down in 2021 with no warning and no consultation, just a phone call: 'See ya later'.</span>

We've been there with our pool. When they ripped out our pool, they said the same thing—and we won't have it for at least six summers and it is still only partially funded. So we have an off-the-cuff remark on air, but we have no indication of where, the cost and who will pay, and there's been no consideration whatsoever of the many businesses based within spitting distance of the speedway that earn their living because of that place. Does the new speedway open as the old one closes? What do those businesses do? What's the transition? Who pays for that?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  Many residents of my electorate will be joining almost a billion people around the world of Hindu, Sikh and Jain faith in celebrating Diwali over the coming week. Diwali is one of the most important festivals in the Indian calendar and is a time of renewal, light and colour. It is referred to as the festival of light and represents the victory of good over evil and light over darkness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, the 5,000-strong Hindu and Indian community comes together to celebrate Diwali in a variety of different ways. This year, for example, Lane Cove Council has organised a Diwali festival in Lane Cove Plaza. The festival will feature the very best of Indian culture, including food, cultural performances, music, dancing and painting. I want to acknowledge Lane Cove Council for its support of this event, as well as leading members of the local Indian community, Balu Moothedath and Gaurav Patni, whose contribution have made the Lane Cove Diwali festival possible. It is vibrant celebrations such as these that make Australia one of the most successful multicultural societies in the world. It is wonderful to see so many Australians, regardless of whether they have Indian heritage or not, embrace the ancient and vibrant traditions of Indian culture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also a time when we reflect on the wonderful contribution Australians of Indian heritage are making to our nation. Not least of them is my friend and neighbour the member for Wentworth, the first person of Indian heritage elected to this chamber. To all those of Indian heritage in my own electorate, I say: shubh Deepawali.</span>

I rise to extend my best wishes to all celebrating the occasion of Diwali, which falls on this Sunday, 27 October. As the member for Greenway, I have the great privilege of representing vibrant and generous Sikh, Hindu and Jain communities in my electorate, and Diwali is one of my favourite festivals of the year. During this time, Greenway is lit up in a wonderful display of optimism, hope and renewal. The warm glow of the diya across homes, businesses, temples and gurudwaras gives pause for reflection on the year that's passed and an opportunity to look forward to the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During Diwali, people are encouraged to take stock of their riches, be they material or spiritual, and hope for a prosperous year ahead. It is also an opportunity to give and forgive. There is spiritual and emotional renewal during Diwali, as the light of the diya washes away past grievances. Diwali is a celebration of the spirit of community, love and respect, and these too are enduring Australian values. Diwali has become a core part of my community's cultural fabric. I wish all those celebrating Diwali a bright and prosperous festival of lights. May this Diwali bring peace and happiness to you and your loved ones.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  It's that time of year again—the Bennelong Table Tennis Cup is back for its ninth year, on 4 November! In my first year as the member for Bennelong I noticed at Eastwood primary that many students from culturally diverse backgrounds were struggling to be fully engaged in sports with their classmates. Overcoming cultural barriers and becoming fully integrated can often be a challenge for young people. So I set out to try to help them through the medium I know best—sport. Along with all of the physical benefits, sport also does wonders for social and mental health. Even in individual sports such as tennis, sport is about enjoying the company of others. The best way to help young kids who are struggling to integrate is to provide them with sporting opportunities to make friends with their classmates, which is exactly what we did. In partnership with Hyundai we put table-tennis tables and equipment in almost every school in Bennelong and organised a tournament for all participating schools. The program has been a wonderful success, ensuring the benefits of sport across our school community. On 4 November we'll be holding the ninth Bennelong Cup, and I especially thank Andrew Hill for all his efforts in running the cup this year. Andrew is a wonderful asset to our community. I look forward to seeing our schools participate again in this wonderful sports program. It's a sport, like tennis, that starts at 'love-all'; if only question time were the same! <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:01</span>):  We are already implementing our national drought strategy. After the National Drought Summit, which the member who asked the question attended, we released a comprehensive set of measures that we have continued to add to since that time. As each stage of the drought has progressed we have stepped up our response to that drought. It began with the establishment of the national Future Drought Fund, combined with measures to support farm household assistance directly to farmers, graziers and their families all around this country. The second phase of that plan began by supporting districts and communities affected by drought by putting money directly into local councils and shires, which kept their economies going, kept people in work and kept local projects proceeding to ensure those local towns and communities, denied the income from the agricultural sector during a drought, were getting that support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to the direct assistance to farmers, graziers and their families, we were rolling out greater mental health support, which I know the member would completely agree with and endorsed at the time, into those communities and outreaching both through remote-type access mechanisms using technology and by directly getting those counsellors. Financial counselling assistance was provided, the angels of the drought, sitting around the kitchen tables of farmers and graziers, helping them with the decisions that they needed to make. The increase to the farm household allowance that we've enabled means that, over a period of just over four years, these families have access to that program, and we've liberalised access to the program so they get access to it even when they have assets of $5½ million and can earn up to $100,000 in off-farm income. Each of those families can still receive $125,000 of support. In the legislation before the House we have ensured that there is a flexibility mechanism which will enable the government to move, considering how the drought progresses, after 30 June next year to do further assistance, should that be required.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are responding to the drought. We will continue to respond to the drought, and people in rural and regional communities know that. Yesterday we met with the National Farmers' Federation and there was enormous overlap between the measures we're putting in place and the measures they are calling for. Obviously things like rate relief, which they have raised, are a matter for the state and territory governments. One of the things that the state and territory governments are also responsible for is freight and fodder subsidies, which I note the NFF did not call to be increased during the course of this drought. We will continue to work with the NFF and all of those in our rural districts and communities, because on this side of the House there are just so many members from rural communities who are affected by this drought, and they will continue to provide an excellent conduit for the development of policies. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Twelve years, as the Treasurer reminds us. The reason they are in a position to do that is the stable and certain financial management that has been pursued by this government since we first came to office. There are three key things we've done to achieve that budget surplus which will be achieved this year. Firstly, we have been getting spending under control—the reckless spending that was implemented by the previous government. People say that we're in Labor's debt. Well, that's true. We are in Labor's debt. There is a debt that Labor left the following government. We are in Swanny's debt. We are in Rudd's debt. We are in the debt of all of those Labor members who presided over the reckless spending, and we're paying that debt off now because we have got spending under control. We have ended the reckless spending of Labor and we have got spending under control. We also budgeted cautiously. We didn't spend money we didn't have, like the mining tax, where revenues never happened but the money was spent anyway. Estimates of iron ore prices at US$183 forever—it never happened, but they spent the money anyway.  And we've been getting Australians off welfare and into work for the last three years. For 36 months, every single month, employment has gone up and up and up. When you get people off welfare they go from welfare recipients to taxpayers, and that has a positive impact on the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you do that, it means you can provide tax relief to Australians, like those in the member for Lindsay's electorate, as we did as the first action of our government after being re-elected in May of this year. It also means you can provide $20.5 million for breast care nurses through the McGrath Foundation; $13.7 million for the National Action Plan for Endometriosis; $39.5 million to immunise pregnant women against whooping cough, provide new diagnostic imaging services and prioritise perinatal health; $503 million for youth mental health and suicide prevention, which is a cornerstone objective of this government; $11½ billion in benefits and support to veterans and their families; and $30 million to establish a network of six veterans wellbeing centres across the nation. When you have a strong budget, that's what you can do. (<span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span>)</span>

The second phase of our drought plan involves investing in local communities, which keeps local communities actually turning over their economy. What the member may not be aware of is the additional taxation incentives we provided to farmers, particularly in the building of silage, which is done by the very contractors and farmhands you're talking about. There was also $350 million in grants to farmers to support to work they're doing on on-farm water infrastructure. The member may not be aware, but that's also done by people who work on farms—the turkey nests and all of that sort of infrastructure. It's our comprehensive drought response. Those recommendations came from directly engaging with our farming communities. I'll ask the minister for drought to add further to the answer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Water Resources, Drought, Rural Finance, Natural Disaster and Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:09</span>):  It is a good question, because it actually underlines the complexity of the drought. It reaches far beyond the farm gate; it goes into the communities, as the Prime Minister has clearly articulated. Some of those programs are about making sure there is a stimulation within the communities and also at the farm gate. Adding on that is the commitment we've made over the lifetime of this drought, which has been eight years. We didn't just start this yesterday; we've been on this journey for over eight years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over $50 million has been put into pests and weeds. Let me tell you what that has done. I can give you a perfect example from my own electorate. In central western Queensland they have built these things called 'dog fences'. While they have been destocked, our farmers, with the aid of their workers, have built fences to exclude wild dogs, so that when it does rain, and we see lambing rates going from five per cent to 85 per cent, shearers will come back into these communities. It's about making sure that we diversify the economic base. Bringing in shearers, means the shearers will invariably leave more money at the cafes, the pubs and the servos. That is the complexity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why our three-pillar approach to this drought is about the here and now. It's about making sure there is money in farmers' pockets in the here and now to keep them going with dignity and respect and to put an environment around them with rural financial counsellors and concessional loans. It's about the community and understanding that it goes further than just the farmers: it's about the families that support those farmers. That's why we've looked at these programs and at the Future Drought Fund. It will continue to deliver programs and give farmers the resilience they need in the future. That's how you tackle this insidious disease that is drought. It's not the same as other natural disasters where you can measure it by fixing a house or a road. It depletes landscapes and bank balances. So you have to escalate your approach and your delivery right through the community, from the farm gate to those that work within the communities, to make sure regional and rural communities survive. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Since 2013, we've announced 900 major projects, 300 of which are completed and 160 of which are under construction. These projects are job creators: NorthConnex, $412 million and 8,700 jobs in New South Wales; the Bruce Highway Upgrade Program, $10 billion and more than 7,200 jobs; Monash Freeway upgrade, millions of dollars and a thousand jobs; WestConnex, $1.5 billion and 10,000 jobs; METRONET in Western Australia, $2.3 billion and 17,000 jobs; M80 Ring Road in Victoria, $500 million, which should delight the member for Jagajaga, and 1,350 jobs; Midland Highway upgrade in Tasmania, $400 million and 1,068 jobs; and the Parkes to Narromine section of the Inland Rail, 890 jobs. For communities along that section, where 10 jobs would be a bonus, 890 jobs are being created by that 1,700-kilometre corridor of commerce. We're getting on and we're delivering it. We're building it. Through a stable and certain budget we can build even more infrastructure, and we will. There will be more jobs, more projects and more delivery than ever occurred under those opposite.</span>

I can confirm that the growth in the national wages bill, otherwise known as compensation of employees, is five per cent higher through the year compared to just 3½ per cent when Labor was in office. I can confirm that since the coalition came to office the minimum wage has never dropped below inflation but, when Labor were last in office, those on the minimum wage were hit by real wages cuts for three out of six years, and I can confirm that the RBA governor has said of our tax cuts, 'We estimate that they'll boost household disposable income by roughly 0.6 or 0.7 per cent of income, and that is a sizable boost.' Don't look at what Labor says; look at what Labor does. And, when it comes to the economy, we're the only party that delivers more jobs, lower taxes and a balanced budget.</span>

Whether it's state governments or the Commonwealth government, we are taking all the measures that are required and that are being urged, and we are working with the rural sector to ensure that they're getting the financial support and the other forms of support they need to be able to work through what is this dreadful drought.</span>

I don't share that view because the resources sector has also been one of the greatest supporters of rural communities in this country. During those dreadful and devastating floods in North Queensland, which I visited so soon after, do you know whose machinery and equipment came in to get those rotting carcasses off those farmers' properties, which were breaking their hearts? It was the mining companies, and it was coalmining companies lending a hand with local communities, putting their arms around them and helping them restore.</span>

He's a former councillor, lawyer, advocate—fierce advocate—on behalf of the constituents in his electorate. He may not have received a knighthood, like the member for Rankin, but he is certainly a very fierce advocate. When we came to government, unemployment was higher. When we came to government, unemployment had been higher, at 5.7 per cent. The participation rate had been lower than it is today, $240 billion of deficits had been accumulated and, in Labor's last year in government alone, 65,000 small businesses had closed their doors. Now, with that record in office from the Labor Party, you can imagine how astounded I was to read the member for Rankin's book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Glory Daze</span>, where he described Wayne Swan's legacy:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... a combination of the best macroeconomic management in the developed world combined with a reform agenda  headlined by carbon pricing and resource taxation, the fruits of which are yet to be properly understood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fruits of which are yet to be properly understood. They're probably not properly understood because they gave us a mining tax that produced no revenue, they gave us cash for clunkers, they gave us pink batts and they gave us accumulated deficits of $240 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, I may have inadvertently misled the House, because I described the book <span style="font-style:italic;">Glory Daze</span> as historical fiction. Well, I now think it is a romantic novel, because it looks at the Labor Party's time in office with rose-coloured glasses and fails to look over their failures. In contrast, we have helped create nearly 1½ million new jobs. As the Prime Minister has said, our tax cuts, our investment in infrastructure, our new apprenticeships, our free trade agreements and our cutting of regulation have seen, for the last three years, for every single month, jobs growth. That is a record that has never been seen. We have never before seen three years of jobs growth every single  month. And we are committed to a surplus budget in 2019-20 after delivering the first balanced budget in 11 years. Only the coalition will continue to cut your taxes, create more jobs and deliver responsible economic management with a surplus budget.</span>

Of course, the point he seeks to make is completely wrong. Let's consider this for a moment. In my portfolio, part of the carriage is consideration, through the FWC, of the minimum wage. Let's think about the minimum wage for a moment. The minimum wage has increased by a total of 9.8 per cent in recent years. In the last three years, that has been far in excess of inflation. Right at the moment, our lowest-paid workers have never seen a real-wage decrease under the coalition.</span>

                  </a>  I am happy to put that fact again. Our lowest-paid workers have never seen a real-wage decrease under the coalition. Under Labor, the minimum wage was cut in real terms in three out of six years. Under the coalition, the minimum wage in Australia is the highest minimum wage in the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are happy to receive questions day in, day out about the way in which our policies are benefiting every working Australian. When you look at wages and entitlements, we've done enormous work with the FWO. The Fair Work Ombudsman has received more than $60 million in additional funding in recent years. They are recovering 64 per cent more in lost wages and underpaid wages than when Labor was in office. And it is the case that we now have the lowest rate of welfare dependency since the 1980s. Whereas you moved hundreds of thousands of people from work into welfare, our government has moved hundreds of thousands of people from welfare into work. Our track record in ensuring that working Australians are better off than under the disastrous policies that you enacted is clear for all to see.</span>

He lives in and supports one of the energy capitals of Australia: Toowoomba and surrounding areas. As this House knows, just a few hours ago we passed the 'big stick' legislation in this place. That legislation puts energy customers back in control. It stops the big energy rip-offs that we've seen in the past. The ACCC described the behaviour that has been going on in this market as unacceptable and unsustainable. This legislation deals with the distortion of and manipulation of the wholesale market, a failure to contract with small new entrants coming into the marketplace, and a failure to pass on substantial and sustained savings to customers, all of which will deliver a fairer deal on electricity for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is just one piece of our broader plan. On 1 July we put in place price caps, a default market offer on standing offers, which ensures that the most vulnerable Australians get a better deal on energy—up to $663 in New South Wales, for instance. We have also put into place the reference price, which ensures customers can choose the best plan for themselves on an apples for apples basis, and we have seen results. Already the ABS are telling us they're seeing downward pressure on prices.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is a risk. Those opposite are calling for a climate emergency. We know from the Greens what that means. It means no oil, no gas and no coal. It means no towers, no cars, no jobs and no idea from those opposite. That's why the member for Hunter and his merry band have said: 'Enough. It's time to join with the coalition and be bipartisan more broadly on these policies.' But the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Hindmarsh have taken a leaf out of Extinction Rebellion's book by gluing themselves to the Greens. That's right, 'Nigel no friends' over there, the member for Hindmarsh, declared a climate emergency on his own—</span>

Why did the Prime Minister say, 'We want to really lift the status of vocational education in Australia,' when the truth is that, under his government, there are now 150,000 fewer apprentices and trainees, the Australian Industry Group says that three-quarters of businesses surveyed can't find the qualified staff they need, and TAFE training and apprenticeship programs have been short-changed by nearly $1 billion?</span>

The figures she refers to, regarding the spending of the government, she knows full well relate to estimates variations for a demand-driven project, and the only difference in expenditure from previous estimates relates to demand and the measures that are required to meet that demand. That member would also know that if that is the case, if there's an adjustment between a measure that is published at a particular amount and then demand is less than that, then the amount spent is less, and she would know that because, when she was Minister for Health, if that's the case, there was a $1½ billion underspend on hospitals, or there was a $1½ billion underspend on schools under the Labor Party, or a $500 million underspend on carers, or a $400 million underspend on veterans—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the serious issue, though—oh, as well—when it comes to the number of apprentices, we have that commitment to establish 80,000 additional apprentices, as we set out at the last election. We agree—and I would hope members opposite would agree, because I'm certainly making constructive progress with the state premiers and chief ministers of the territories—that our skills system needs big change, because it is not delivering the outcomes that we have wanted to achieve. These programs are run by the states and supported by the Commonwealth. We need a completely different approach to how we're doing this, and that's what we're working with the states and territories to achieve. I'm looking forward to our next round of COAG meetings.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />The third point I'd make is this. When we came to government, we had to pick up the absolute debacle and mess of VET FEE-HELP. The figures, even the ones that the Leader of the Opposition is pointing to, referred to it, because the reason the number of people came off was that we fixed the VET FEE-HELP mess and were no longer paying people for courses they weren't doing and were being registered as being trained in. You see, on our side of the House, we want to get people actually trained for real jobs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure </span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:34</span>):  Can I thank the member for Reid for her question and for her outstanding advocacy of Western Sydney. Because of our strong, stable, certain financial management, the government are able to invest a record $100 billion in infrastructure right across this country over the decade, which means that right now there are 130 major projects underway, supporting 50,000 people in work. One of those giant projects being supported is one I know the member for Reid is very supportive of, and that is the WestConnex project. To put the size of this project in perspective, this $17 billion project is more than double the investment, in today's dollars, than the investment into the iconic Snowy Mountains hydro scheme back in the day. That's just one of the giant projects that we're doing. And, as the member for Reid knows, we're halfway through the construction of this project in partnership with the New South Wales government and it is already making a massive difference for families in Western Sydney. As the member for Reid knows, if a resident is travelling from Parramatta to the CBD and back each day in peak-hour traffic, they are saving over five hours a week in travel time because of the work of the WestConnex project, and that's just one project.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Sydney as well we have the giant Western Sydney Airport under construction as we speak. It's supporting 11,000 jobs in the construction phase, and 28,000 jobs will be supported in the delivery phase. Further afield, we've got the Inland Rail project—$9 billion. Coming up we have the Tullamarine rail in Melbourne, $5 billion; and fast rail to Geelong, $2 billion. All of these giant nation-building projects are able to be done because this government is able to manage the budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asked about alternatives, and the alternative is stark. When the Labor Party were last in government, for six long years, and the Leader of the Opposition was the transport minister for the entire time, they weren't able to invest at the same rate we are able to. They talked a lot about investing in nation-building projects but they couldn't deliver. When you look at WestConnex, for example, the member for Grayndler as transport minister said that this was vitally important for Western Sydney families but didn't invest a cent. When talking about the Western Sydney Airport, he actually said that we needed to start the work then, in 2009, but didn't invest a cent. In relation to Inland Rail, not a sod was turned. In relation to fast rail, he talked and he talked but, of course, it was the fast rail that never came. They were all talk, no action because they couldn't manage the finance. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This government takes enormously seriously those issues, and those are matters that are part of a very broad approach. Indeed, recently, at the ministerial council for ministers for industrial relations, those issues were front and centre, including the way in which laws around manslaughter could be better drafted or better enforced. It is a very serious matter. I apologise; I do not have the exact number to hand but I'll take the question on notice and get the answer for you.</span>

He knows, as do so many members on this side of the House, just how critical modern communication is to the people of regional and remote Australia so they can stay connected, they can stay safe, they can do business, their children can be educated and they can enjoy all the benefits of connectivity we take for granted in the cities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, on our side of the House, we are absolutely committed to rolling out communication services to regional and remote Australia. That's why it's so important that we've been able to take a stable and certain approach to the rollout of the National Broadband Network, in contrast to the alternative approach that I'm asked about, which was the chaotic mess we inherited from Labor when we came to government in 2013. After six years, Labor had spent $6.5 billion. There were barely 50,000 premises connected to the fixed-line network. Every target that Labor had set had been missed. By contrast, today over 10 million premises are able to connect, over six million premises are connected, and every week 35,000 premises are being connected, in contrast to the grand total of 50,000 that I mentioned Labor had achieved across six years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to that stable management, we are also able to focus on getting better services in regional and remote Australia—services like Sky Muster, the satellite service. In the electorate of Grey, over 15,000 premises are able to be served. Recently, in Dubbo, I joined with the member for Parkes to launch Sky Muster Plus. Under this evolution of NBN satellite services, we now provide unmetered data for essential daily tasks such as accessing banking, health or government services, software updates and emails. None of this will count towards a household's monthly data allowance. That has been very well received in regional and remote Australia. Members of parliament on this side of the House don't live inside the goat's cheese circle, like most of the people on the other side of the House; they live in regional and remote Australia and they understand the needs of the people of regional and remote Australia. That is why we are tailoring the products delivered over the NBN to the needs of people in regional and remote Australia, including the new satellite service, Sky Muster Plus.</span>

The Federal Court found Liberal Party member and donor Gerry Hanssen was driven by a blind hatred of unions when he blocked safety inspectors from a site where a worker had died. Can the minister confirm the only new penalty that the government currently has before the parliament for Gerry Hanssen is that he won't be allowed to run as a union official?</span>

They should go before the relevant courts and be fined and punished in accordance with the law, as of course was the case with Mr Hanssen. As the shadow minister knows well, the laws that we have placed in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) Bill that apply to the disqualification of members of registered organisations as officials are designed to apply equally to organisations that represent employers and to organisations that represent employees. As the member knows, the changes in the ensuring integrity bill that go to the issue of a potential deregistration after evidence is put to a court via the Registered Organisations Commission and after their dutiful consideration of that evidence apply equally to organisations which are registered as employer associations or as employee organisations. The very point of those laws is to ensure lawful conduct of both employer and employee organisations according to the same standards.</span>

I also want to acknowledge the member for Kooyong and the member for Cook for the work they've done in establishing a strong budget to enable us to grow initiatives for Indigenous Australians. In the 2019-20 budget we confirmed $5.2 billion towards investment in key and critical areas that will make a difference to the lives of Indigenous Australians—areas of employment, job creation, educational opportunities and getting kids to school. That's what we're focused on. We're focused on making a difference in the lives of all Indigenous Australians across this nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indigenous Procurement Policy has resulted in 1,765 Indigenous businesses being extremely successful in taking on 16,460 contracts. That is $2.49 billion going into the pockets of Indigenous people who have established very successful businesses. But what they're doing is employing other Indigenous members within their communities. They are taking them off welfare dependency and creating job opportunities that are providing a tremendous way forward.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, we're tackling suicide. The number of young Indigenous Australians committing suicide is far too high. What we're doing is investing in initiatives that will see a whole-of-community approach. What I've noticed in some of the reports is that school plays a critical part in the networks of connectivity. In the Kimberley coronial inquiry there were suicides occurring during the school holidays, which demonstrated the importance of our work in engaging our children in educational pathways from preschool through to tertiary studies. All of us are working in that direction, and a strong budget gives us the capacity to have the resources.</span>

But our continued work around our economy will give us greater capacity to make a difference on the ground in the way in which we provide opportunity. I want to see—collectively, we all want to see—success, because that is the way in which we will change the dynamic within Aboriginal communities. I thank those involved for the work that we are collectively doing.</span>

It is patently false. Indeed, the falsehood of that goes back to, I believe, the ACTU media release that was released on the day the Manager of Opposition Business first asked these questions. That release, I recall, said something to the effect that the ensuring integrity bill would make it harder for individuals to get right of entry to workplaces to check for occupational health and safety concerns. That is 100 per cent false. Nothing in the ensuring integrity bill changes one iota of the law about the present rights to access workplaces for occupational health and safety reasons. That is a falsehood. It's that falsehood that forms the premise of the question the Manager of Opposition Business has just asked.</span>

I've got a summary of the question, which went to a previous answer and then there was quite a general point about companies being able to get away with, I think you said, appalling or harmful activity.</span>

Nothing in the ensuring integrity bill prevents occupational health and safety inspectors from entering workplaces. But one thing that is stopping health and safety inspectors entering workplaces is the militant, bullying behaviour of the CFMEU, which members opposite refuse to call out, refuse to do anything about. The effect of that is that occupational health and safety inspectors in the Queensland public sector union will not go to 17 of the largest construction sites in Queensland. That displays the sort of concern that you have for the realities that these people are dealing with.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans and Defence Personnel and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:53</span>):  I thank the member for Stirling for his question and I note his service in the Australian Army. I say to him, as I say to all members in this place on both sides of the chamber: thank you for your service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians can be proud of the support we provide to our veteran community and their families. More than $11.5 billion in this year's budget will go towards supporting around 280,000 veterans and their families. It's due to the strong budget position that we've been able to have record investment in the transformation of the Department of Veterans' Affairs over the last three budgets. In fact, an additional $500 million has been provided to the Department of Veterans' Affairs for that transformation program, which has made it faster, easier and less stressful for the majority of veterans making their claims through the digitisation of records, which has been welcomed right throughout the ex-service community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say also that that strong budget has allowed for greater investment in mental health programs across our nation. In fact, $230 million per year is provided to support our veterans if they're suffering from mental illness or need some assistance of a professional nature. This government has been able to introduce free lifetime health care for all veterans and their families. For those veterans listening today who may be struggling with their own mental health, I encourage them to contact Open Arms on 1800011046.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also pleased to announce that during the election period and since that period there has been bipartisan support for the six new wellbeing centres that are being developed across our nation, many of them in the seats of members opposite as well as the crossbench, and several of them in seats of members on this side of the chamber. Also in this year's budget there was $16 million in additional funding to assist with veterans employment initiatives, working with the ex-service community. These are all initiatives that have been made possible through a strong budget position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

I was pleased to receive the support of those opposite in terms of the new veterans card, that nationally identifiable veterans card, which we made available to veterans throughout our nation; the Veterans' Covenant, which has had strong support right throughout the nation over the past 12 months; and the new veterans lapel pin. I'll be making the information about the distribution of the veterans lapel pin available to members opposite and members on this side of the chamber in the coming days—how they can be involved personally in the distribution of those pins in their own community if they wish to be involved. I realise, Mr Speaker, that props are unparliamentary, but in this case I would like to demonstrate to the House this new pin, which will be available for everyday public recognition of our veterans throughout the nation.

What I've informed the House is that the ensuring integrity bill does absolutely nothing to prevent lawful protests, lawful strike, lawful entry to premises. What is it that members opposite are suggesting—that as a government we should accept any action at any time, even if that action breaks the law? That is what the opposition members are asking us to accept. That might explain why they have this passive acceptance of what the CFMEU does. That might explain why they are willing to accept $16 million in fines for the CFMEU. That might explain why they're willing to passively accept 2,164 offences by the CFMEU without ever taking action. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What our government has always said is that behaviour on worksites—with respect to workers' benefit fund bills—whether that is employee organisations or employer organisations, must be within the law. This bill ensures that there are appropriate standards in place, as there always should be, to ensure that organisations that repetitively break the law are placed before a court so that a court can make a determination as to whether it is just, in all the circumstances, for that organisation or a part of that organisation to be deregistered. And the only organisation in Australia that looks even close to meeting that important standard would be the organisation that you regularly accept enormous amounts of money from—that being the CFMEU.</span>

Australian women have benefited from the coalition government's success in growing an economy that creates jobs, pathways and careers and supports an education system that nurtures talent and ability, because part of managing the economy well is getting the best people in the workforce—the best person for the job—and women are a very big part of that. Our government is investing $151 million through the 2018 Women's Economic Security Statement to ensure that women are well positioned to play that full and equal role in every aspect of our economy. Nearly 1.5 million have been created since September 2013, and, importantly, most of these jobs have been taken up by women. </span>

That's fantastic. This morning I was sorry to miss the Women of Waste Leadership Breakfast held in Sydney, hosted by the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association's dynamic CEO, Gayle Sloan. This event recognises women who are driving change in the industry, creating new career prospects for women coming up in the ranks. </span>

Under the Morrison government, women's workforce participation is at a near record high of over 61 per cent. Over six million women are in employment. The average weekly ordinary time earnings for women increased 3.6 per cent just over the last year. And the gender pay gap is at a record low, with, of course, more work to do in this space. </span>

The member for Sydney's misunderstanding is the misunderstanding of the modern Labor Party, because women's policy covers all portfolios. But at its heart—at the heart of women's policy—is economic policy. You need employers, you need trade agreements, you need the small and medium enterprise business sector, you need jobs, you need lower taxes—you need so much more than just glib statements and glib slogans. They've got the slogans; we've got the plan—the plan and the commitment to carry it through.</span>

But I am asked about jobs. I have been asked about a matter that was actually determined by the Fair Work Commission—not by the government but by the Fair Work Commission—which was actually set up by the former Leader of the Opposition through an independent process. So I will leave those matters to the Fair Work Commission, which was actually set up by the Labor Party. But I'm asked about jobs. I'm asked about jobs, and I can confirm that almost 1.5 million jobs have been created by this government, by this government supporting a framework which means business can create jobs in our economy. We've done that by lowering taxes. We've done that by investing in infrastructure. We've done that by reducing the costs of doing business. We've done that by expanding the trade borders of this country, where we've gone from 26 per cent of what we export covered by our agreements to now 70 per cent.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. The member for Watson seems to think that this chamber is some sort of debating society for 14-year-olds. I'm talking about people's real jobs and what our government is doing to support people getting jobs, and he wants to play semantics. I'll be very clear. No, we don't believe that the decision of the Fair Work Commission is the reason why Australians are getting jobs in this country. We think it's because we're lowering taxes; building infrastructure; putting trade policies in place, which those opposite have to be dragged kicking and screaming to the table to support; taking on big energy companies to ensure that companies and consumers can get a fair deal; and continuing to keep our budget under control so that we can support the essential services that Australians rely on.</span>

We've ensured that the participation rate has risen to a record high. Over the year to September 2013 there were 85,000 jobs. That's what happened under their watch over that period of time. Over the same period of time under our watch there were 311,600 jobs created. There are more full-time jobs and more part-time jobs—more jobs, more jobs, more jobs. That's what this government is doing. Those on that side took jobs away from people and they want to take more jobs away from people with their reckless policies and their higher taxes.</span>

Her beautiful 15-year-old daughter was befriended online by a male who made out that they were 18 years old. He turned out to be a 50-year-old sexual predator. He eventually lured Carly to a remote spot, and it resulted in a terrible tragedy. Sonya has now dedicated her life to keeping children, online and in real life, as safe as humanly possible. I want to thank her very much for the work that she is doing with the Federal Police and my department. Thank you.</span>

The Labor Party has previously rejected this legislation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason this legislation is needed is that, in Australia at the moment, we have 277 security card holders at airports and seaports who either have an association with an outlaw motorcycle gang or are on the National Criminal Target List. We know that the National Criminal Target List reads like a who's who of the CFMMEU, but the fact is that we cannot allow these people into secure areas. The Labor Party opposed this legislation in the past, but, if they are serious about securing our borders, they need to put that opposition into the past and support us.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are serious links between outlaw motorcycle gangs and the CFMMEU, and that is the reason why the Labor Party would oppose this position. Who do we know in the CFMMEU? We know Mr John Setka. He had this to say earlier today about the Leader of the Opposition:</span>

That's the year to date. In 2018, the data, which is preliminary, to be confirmed, showed there were 144 workplace deaths, and the number which is final data for the 2017 calendar year is 119.</span>

Funnily enough, when the Federal Court made a decision roughly 10 days ago regarding raids, where the media turned up before the Federal Police did, that Federal Court decision never found its way into the parliament. That Federal Court decision isn't one of the ones that the minister decided he needed to tell us about. Why? Because the form of lawlessness that had been uncovered was lawlessness from the Registered Organisations Commission itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a Federal Court decision which had to take place because the Registered Organisations Commission had commenced an investigation that was found to be beyond their power—an investigation that was found to be unlawful.

                  </a>  Behind me, people are saying 'Is it crickets? Is it quiet?' It's actually worse than that. Their response is to say, 'Let's give them more power.' If an organisation created by this government is acting unlawfully and is doing so in a way which is unlawfully acting against unions, its response is to give the organisation more power. There's lawlessness from the government's friends. The Registered Organisations Commission is not the only example of it. There's the ABCC. We had Nigel Hadgkiss, the leader of that, go when he had breached the act. What was his breach? He was telling employers to break the law. He was telling employers to break the law—that's how he broke the law. So those opposite keep wanting to give that organisation more power as well. Gerry Hanssen is a big donor to the WA Liberal Party. This is not someone who has bought a few raffle tickets. We are talking $175,000 to the federal and WA Libs and Nats over the last five years or so. In 2008, he was fined $174,000 for exploiting foreign workers. A decade later, an auditor alleged 93 employees were underpaid by him more than $270,000, an amount of money even bigger than what he donates to the Liberal Party. What's the punishment for him under these laws? It's not just that he's underpaying people; it's after there was a death on his worksite that he blocked an occupational health and safety inspection from a union. And what was the government's response? Oh, well, there will be a punishment for him; he won't be allowed to be a union official. That's the punishment. That's the new law that's responded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know if those opposite appreciate it but the public are onto the fact their attack on unions is simply an attack on workers. That's all it is. When you defend the people who underpay, you attack workers. When you defend the organisations that attack unions, that are responsible for arguing for better pay, you attack workers. Every time, they block and support their Liberal-donor mates who block access for health and safety inspections.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even today, we had the minister wanting to go straight from James Hardie to health and safety inspections, to desperately talk about another issue. But everything those opposite want to do is about blocking access to safer workplaces and better remuneration for workers and that is the simplicity of the strategy coming from the government. It's no accident that those opposite voted for the changes to penalty rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time the Prime Minister says, 'An independent agency made that decision,' we know how the government deal with independent agencies. When there was an independent agency meant to make sure that truck drivers had safe rates of pay and those opposite didn't like the decision the independent agency made, they didn't just abolish the decision; they abolished the entire agency. But here, when a decision is made that they support, they back it in every time. And the reason they supported it was because it meant less pay for workers—simple as that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If lawlessness was in fact the issue for those opposite, if lawlessness was something they wanted to act on, they would have abolished the Registered Organisations Commission, they would have deregistered 7-Eleven as a company and they would have prevented Gerry Hanssen and a series of celebrity chefs from employing people in the future. The question I have is: if someone is in breach of the law and therefore should not be able to do that job again, how come every single person engaged in wage theft goes on to continue to employ people and probably rip them off again? Why does that happen? Why do we get no response there?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We got these sudden thundering comments from the minister today. I think we were onto it that he has no idea what happened in the James Hardie dispute, absolutely no idea. If he thinks that the problem there was unlawful industrial action, well, he's following a fine tradition of members of the Liberal Party from his state in spending a whole lot of their time defending James Hardie against asbestos victims. The former member for Curtin had a proud record of it as well. What happened in the James Hardie dispute was the actions taken by the unions were not during an official bargaining period. They were not actions that would have ticked the box of authorised industrial action. It was a series of actions that would have breached section 28G of the legislation in front of us right now, the ensuring integrity bill, where the test is an entire union can be deregistered, whether or not their action—unless it was protected in the act, which none of this was—interfered with the activities of a federal system employer. Well, of course it did! And it needed to. They engaged in an escalating series of protests, work stoppages, work bans and boycotts, as well as marches, investor activism and political lobbying. But, had they not engaged in the work stoppages, the work bans and the boycotts, James Hardie would have got away with it. James Hardie would have got away with the massive transfer of funds offshore to make sure that people who were dying of asbestosis never got the compensation they deserved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought maybe we would have got a better response last week, when we had victims of asbestosis in the gallery and we told the government they were there. And what was the response? The minister goes off on his rant about the CFMMEU, and the Prime Minister, sitting in that chair—after I'd pointed to exactly where they were sitting—swings his chair to face the minister and turns his back on them. We often talk about this government turning its back on workers, but you rarely get a demonstration of what this government is all about—when there are people who, if ensuring integrity legislation had been in place at the time, never would have been eligible for compensation. The money would have gone offshore and James Hardie would have got away with it had those union protests not happened. </span>

The people on your side were acting for James Hardie—acting for James Hardie—and it was the unions that took the action that made sure people ended up getting compensation and James Hardie was held to account. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, let's not pretend that the James Hardie issue is in the distant past and it's never going to happen again. We know that, as long as there are employers like Gerry Hanssen, as long as there are operations like those we saw with some of the franchisees of 7-Eleven, as long as there are employers like TV celebrity chefs who make millions of dollars for themselves but, because of the complexity, they claim, of industrial relations, even though they comply with all the volumes of tax law they can't check an award to make sure they're paying people the right amount, as long as employers like that exist, there will be a need for employee representation. This government, in attacking employee representation, is attacking workers. It's part of the low-wage strategy that is a deliberate design feature of this government.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  Nothing gives me more pleasure than to speak on this MPI about how this government is looking after the interests of Australian workers. And we are doing that in a way that we know the best interests of workers are served—by ensuring that they have a job. No government has an employment record like this government does. Under the Morrison government, the number of Australians in work is at a record high. Almost 13 million Australians are now in work. It's worth repeating that: almost 13 million Australians are now in work. Almost 1.5 million more Australians are in jobs since the coalition was elected in September 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the record to end all records. We have seen 36 months of continuous monthly jobs growth to September 2019, the longest period of continuous monthly jobs growth since records began. What an extraordinary record. It is something that everyone on this side of the House should be extraordinarily proud of, because the greatest thing that we can do as a government is ensure that every Australian worker, where possible, has a job, and we are doing that and we are delivering—36 months of continuous monthly jobs growth, the longest period of continuous monthly jobs growth since records began. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen a record level of Australians in full-time work, with almost 60 per cent of all new jobs created being full-time jobs. Full-time employment is at a record high of 8.8 million workers. We have a near-record-high participation rate of over 66 per cent and a record-high female participation rate. Wherever you look, the government is delivering for Australian workers, and we will continue to do that because it is our primary focus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor left office in September 2013, unemployment was at 5.7 per cent and rising, having risen from 4.4 per cent when they came into office in November 2007. You don't hear them talk about that much, do you? Their unemployment rate was climbing when they were in office. An extra 205,300 people joined the unemployment queues under Labor. In the last 12 months of Labor, full-time employment fell by 19,700. Under the coalition, unemployment has fallen to 5.2 per cent as of September 2019. We are happy, every day of the week, to contrast our performance with theirs, and we will continue to do that until the next election. Labor failed working Australians, yet we have this MPI today. Under six years of Labor the jobless queues grew by around 206,000. Across Labor's time in office, around 127,000 manufacturing jobs—around one in every eight—disappeared completely. This is a sad stat: under Labor, youth unemployment increased from 9.6 per cent in November 2007 to 12.6 per cent in September 2013. Young workers, when they left school, were faced with the prospect of unemployment. Not only were they faced with the prospect of unemployment; Labor cut over $1.2 billion from employer incentives in just two years. The number of apprenticeships and trainee commitments fell by 85,000 in a single year in 2012-13, the greatest fall in history.</span>

                  </a>  I know the member sitting here next to me will have a lot more to say on this, but that is the greatest fall in history. We had to fix up the rorting. We had to fix up VET FEE-HELP. They failed dismally. $241.3 million in incentives were cut in Labor's 2013 economic statement. This was the record that we were still trying to fix. Since 2016, over 37,000 students have had VET FEE-HELP loan debts recredited by the Commonwealth. That's 37,000 students, who are often vulnerable, with a cost to the taxpayer of repairing this disastrous program totalling just under $250 million. Look at our side and contrast. We have, at the moment, more people in work and fewer people on welfare than in over 30 years. That is our record: record jobs growth, fewer people on welfare, more people on work.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member opposite, as part of this MPI, mentioned looking after workers and donations. One set of donations that he failed to mention were donations by the CFMMEU. How much have they totalled, Member for Watson? Was there any mention of that? Since 2013, I'm advised, it is $4 million. Do we hear reference to that? 'The most recidivist corporate offender in Australian history' is what Justice Vasta had to say, yet we hear nothing from you with regard to those donations. Sure, you'll look at an individual donation to try to make your point, but over $4 million and you will do nothing about the CFFMEU. You are a disgrace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what's happened with wages growth. The latest ABS wage price index increased by 2.3 per cent over the year to the June quarter 2019—up from a 2.1 per cent increase over the year to the June quarter 2018. The ABS <span style="font-style:italic;">Average Weekly Earnings</span> publication showed that total weekly earnings for full-time and part-time employees increased by 2.5 per cent over the year to May 2019. The most recent ABS <span style="font-style:italic;">Characteristics of Employment</span> publication showed that median earnings for employees increased by 5.4 per cent over the year to August 2018—the largest increase since 2005. Wage increases continue to outpace increases in cost of living, and, importantly, living standards also continue to increase, with real net national disposable income per capita rising one per cent to be 2.7 per cent higher through the year. We are supporting wages growth. The government is setting the right conditions for a strong economy and jobs growth. In particular, a healthy labour market will help drive wages growth for workers. This is why our employment record is so critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Watson for this MPI, because it enables us on this side to talk about our record of providing jobs for workers. That is the single most important thing that any government can do. Our record surpasses that of any government when it comes to what we are doing in creating employment in this country, and we will continue to make sure our focus is on creating jobs. We want to build on that extraordinary record where we have seen 36 months of continuous monthly jobs growth—the longest period of continuous monthly jobs growth since records began. Do you know what that jobs growth enables us to do? It enables us to provide the essential services that the Australian people need. That's why we can make sure that funding is there for the NDIS. It's why we can ensure that funding is there for health. It's why we can ensure that funding is there for each occasion. We're going to continue to grow the economy. We're going to continue to make sure the budget is in balance. We're going to make sure that we continue to deliver jobs growth for this country, because it is vital for workers and the provision of services.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="LTU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on this matter of public importance today, because this government's failure to look after the interests of Australian workers is an outrage. It seems that every day brings a new opportunity for them to attack working people around the country, whether it be their ensuring integrity bill—which seeks to give any interested party the ability to have a union deregistered—or their failure to address the scourges of insecure work or how they've turned their backs on more than eight per cent of working people who are underemployed or the number of workplace deaths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that working people simply aren't this government's priority. Not only does the government ignore the issues facing working people, not only do they turn their backs whilst wages are stagnant and working families are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet, but they actively work to make it harder for them. They've put in place policies that suppress wages growth—Senator Cormann said so—like cutting funding from TAFE and skills training programs that help workers get higher skilled jobs or voting to cut penalty rates. Not only that; they make it harder for workers to organise, to collectively bargain for pay rises, when everybody knows the economy is screaming out for a pay rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've worked in my role as ACTU president with teachers, shop assistants, care workers, kindergarten teachers, childcare workers, aged-care workers, pharmacists, doctors and hairdressers. They all rely on the collective power of their unions, who work tirelessly for their members. Thousands of union organisers are out every day in workplaces, trying to protect their members and get their members pay rises. I come from a great union, the mighty Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, that fights for nurses, for the public health system, for their patients' rights. They took unprotected action not for pay rises, not for better conditions, but for workloads to protect their patients so that they could deliver safe care. Under these new laws, as the Manager of Opposition Business described before with James Hardie, they could be deregistered—that great union that has done great things for our health system. This government put the blame for their shoddy policies on unions—the only way workers get a pay rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The classic chant at a union rally goes: 'When workers' rights are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back.' It is no wonder this government is afraid of unions. Under this government, workers' rights are constantly under attack. Working people in this country are having to worry about whether they'll have a shift tomorrow, whether their jobs will be outsourced or offshored, whether they'll be able to pay the bills or whether their contracts will be renewed. We will have almost a whole generation of workers who won't know what it's like to have a paid holiday. They are fighting back against wage theft, insecure work and the exploitation of workers in the gig economy. Unions are fighting against sham contracting, out-of-control casualisation and the exploitation of migrant workers. The government talks about the lawlessness of the union movement while the union movement fights daily against employer lawlessness. They're fighting against employers whose business models are based on lawlessness and whose profits are driven by undercutting people's rights. They fight against bodies like the ROC or the ABCC. In the presentation given by the Manager of Opposition Business before, we heard exactly what that means.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this government is looking for lawlessness, it doesn't need to look any further than its own regulatory bodies to find it. But, instead, it's spending taxpayer money on pursuing unions and working people. Every week we hear of more employers doing the wrong thing—ripping off workers or putting their lives at risk. Thousands of workers all over the country are affected, yet those opposite come into this chamber, time after time, with bills like 'ensuring integrity' and 'protecting workers' entitlements' and bang on about the same things over and over.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The union movement is the largest organisation in this country, with nearly two million paid-up members, and I'm telling you that that's bigger than the Liberal Party. And I ask those opposite: do you really think that the people in those unions don't understand what these bills are about? Working people in this country know what's up. They know that their unions are fighting for them and that your government is doing nothing of the sort. If you genuinely cared about working people or working families, you'd be acting on wage stagnation. You'd be trying to ensure that people are being paid the superannuation they deserve. You'd stop treating union members and union officials like criminals, because they're the ones who are standing up for working people, while you continue to erode their rights and protect the real criminals. You are failing to look after the interests of Australian workers. You're actively working against them.</span>

I hear the members on the other side talking about lawlessness. I've had a few personal experiences with the lawlessness of unions. I didn't even hear the member for Watson mention the name of the MPI he put on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. He didn't mention it once during his whole 10-minute speech. But let's get back to my experience with unions, now that you've raised it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr IRONS:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you. I can hear him interjecting and saying I was right. He didn't mention it once during his speech. My personal experience with unions and their lawlessness requires a bit of family history—the member for Watson may be aware of it. The union that my uncle was the secretary of was the Painters and Dockers Union in Melbourne. I understand that no member in this place would say they weren't lawless. They were definitely lawless. Anyone here who's read any books on it—whether it be on Billy 'The Texan' Longley or all the people involved in the unions at that stage—knows that that is the finest example of union lawlessness that Australia has ever seen. But we never hear from the opposite side about how perfect the unions are, because they know they can't use those sorts of examples. I worked for Gas and Fuel in Victoria at one stage and was forced to be a member of part of a union. The union had a meeting one night to which six delegates turned up. The union proposed that all the overtime bans would be put onto all the members—all the people who worked and relied on those overtime efforts every Sunday. Every second Sunday we used to work for Gas and Fuel and every member of that particular employer was able to get overtime. But the six delegates from the union said, 'We are going to ban overtime.' They called another meeting—an extraordinary meeting—and over 1,000 people turned up and defied the unions—they defied the unions taking the extra money off them that they earned each week because they wanted to rule the roost and take over. We never hear about those examples from that side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, in another company I worked for, we had a national transport company doing work for us across the nation. The unions then imposed a $20-a-week pay rise on that particular transport company and, because of that, directly put over 200 people out of work. So that's the work of the unions—the unions who 'stand up for people' across Australia. They want to take away our benefits and they also want to take away the jobs of people, because what they say has to be followed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the A-G in here during question time. He also talked about the minimum wage. We heard about the wages and looking after their interests. He also mentioned that the minimum wage has increased by a total of 9.8 per cent in the last three years, far in excess of inflation. Also, our lowest paid workers have never seen a real wage decrease under the coalition, but, under Labor, the minimum wage was cut, in real terms, in three out of six years. Under the coalition's stewardship, the minimum wage is now the highest in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the member for Watson, towards the end of his speech, talk about underpayment of wages. I agree: underpayment of wages by employers is a terrible thing. It shouldn't happen—it shouldn't be done by anyone at all. This government has zero tolerance of any exploitation of workers. That includes the underpayment of wages and entitlements by any employer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the coalition that has put in place stronger protections for Australian workers and their entitlements. We have taken unprecedented action to date to protect vulnerable workers, including over $60 million in additional resources and more powers for the regulator, the Fair Work Ombudsman, as well as increasing penalties against law-breaking employers up to tenfold. As we speak, this government is drafting legislation to introduce criminal penalties for the first time for the worst forms of worker exploitation—one of the key recommendations of the Migrant Workers Taskforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, on this side of the House, have committed to further improving the system. We know that the vast majority of employers try to do the right thing by their workers, but it's important that we have a strong deterrent for the minority of employers who deliberately exploit their staff. That's why we have released a discussion paper focused on identifying further improvements to provide protections of employees' wages and entitlements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has supported the Fair Work Ombudsman, the FWO, with over $60 million in additional funding in recent years, including $20 million in the 2019-20 budget, to conduct more investigations relating to underpayments and sham contracting and to take action to deter noncompliance, and I'm sure the members on that side of the House would agree that that's what needs to be done to protect against underpayments. This government will provide stability and certainty to workers and their entitlements all across Australia, and we're the only government that will do that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  I think the member for Watson is right: this government has failed working Australians. Just think about it: when was the last time you heard anybody on that side of the parliament talk, in a positive way, about the role of the trade union movement? They never talk about the role of unions in society. They never talk about what workers do to protect wages. And they certainly don't talk about what unions do with respect to safety—although, I'll give it to you: you are going to talk about the CFMMEU, and I will come back to that, about safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By the way, the Attorney-General also was right today—I know because I went and checked his figures. Up to October this year, there have been 121 workplace deaths. Seventy per cent of those deaths occurred in the building and construction industry, the transport industry and the mining industry. So, when you're talking about the CFMMEU, make sure you actually use those figures. When we're talking about workplace deaths in those areas of operation, the Transport Workers Union, the CFMMEU and other building and construction unions are in the most difficult, most dangerous workplaces. So, having two sons who work in those industries, I don't mind having an extra pair of eyes looking out for their safety, and I think most parents of tradies would probably take the same view.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us just look at this government's record when it comes to industrial relations. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government couldn't wait to put $250 million into a royal commission into trade unions—$250 million. They were going to smash the union movement. They were going to expose all the excesses of power. Do you know how many prosecutions emerged out of that? Not one. This was all a political exercise. They've brought down a raft of anti-worker legislation. They're making it very hard. They could have actually joined with Labor to save the penalty rates of 700,000 of our lowest paid workers in the hospitality and retail industries—and I commend the work of Gerard Dwyer and the SDA to try to protect those workers—but where were they when this debate was going on? They were lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw what occurred in respect of the AWU raid. As the member for Watson indicated, not only was the actual investigation an excess of power but the staff of the minister responsible actually briefed the media about a police raid that was about to occur in Sydney. They walked away from that. No wonder she hid behind a whiteboard for weeks! Now we see what they want to do with the 'ensuring integrity' bill. They want to make it easier to deregister unions and to disqualify union officials, who are there to stand up for workers. I suppose I should let the other side in on a secret: there is no God-given right for unions to exist; it's not some form of divine mandate. Unions exist only to fulfil a need, and that need is to represent workers. If there were no need out there, employers were doing the right thing and governments over there were ensuring that workplaces were properly protected, there probably wouldn't be a union movement.</span>

We have bipartisan support for something that was called the Industrial Relations Commission, at least I thought we did. It started as the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It had representation from people from union backgrounds and people from employer backgrounds. When we were in government, there used to be an appointment from each side to ensure that there was fairness, decency and balance in their decisions. This year the head of Fair Work Australia asked the government for one extra appointment. They appointed six, all from the employer side—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="148150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  First and foremost I agree with some of the most recent comments from the previous member. I've described them this way before and I'll do it again: unions are a necessary evil, just like banks. They do play a role. They are an important part of what happens in the industrial relations system, just as employer organisations are. Over a long period of time they've genuinely done some good things. I was here for the contribution from the member for Watson, and I genuinely like the member for Watson. It's rare that I'll stand here and give advice, but I'll give him some advice on this: be very careful about politicising fatalities in workplaces. I spent some time, when my hair wasn't grey, as a principal inspector, and I know those individuals who are out there every single day, every week, every month and every year getting called to workplaces to investigate incidents where people have been very seriously injured or lost their lives. We in this place should all be incredibly cautious about how we look at these issues. Individuals around the country are distinctly affected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to my next point. I know the individuals who do this type of work. They are ex-tradespeople, ex-engineers, ex-construction workers, ex-nurses, ex-union officials—it doesn't really matter. They are doing an incredibly difficult job at a time when those workplaces are in absolute crisis. They are not wilting wallflowers. These are individuals who go onto some pretty heavy-duty construction sites and deal with some roughnecks, I have to say, and they have done so for a long period of time. Yet on 30 January 2019 we saw a report in Queensland's <span style="font-style:italic;">Courier-Mail</span> that says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The … Government's own … inspectors are so fearful of "occupation violence" from unions and workers they are refusing to attend 17 construction sites across Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is in no-one's interest. These people are highly skilled at identifying challenges and problems and ensuring they are fixed. So, regardless of what we are doing here in this debate, we need to ensure that those individuals can continue to do their jobs, and I'd say to everyone in the chamber that is what we need to be doing because this is about ensuring that no-one loses their life on a worksite. Once again, I will acknowledge the member for Cooper's genuine work for the union movement and her absolute commitment over a long period of time. If we look at asbestos, and this seems to be the topic of the day, standards around asbestos—working with it, the removal of it, getting rid of it from workplaces—have genuinely improved over a long period of time with consultation between unions and employers, and we need to continue to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say to those opposite, who are calling us out saying we don't look after workers, that we're not interested in workers and that we don't do things for them, I will give you some examples. Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan, I know you were involved in this. You were interested and you certainly worked hard to make sure we had a solution to the exploitation of foreign workers, particularly in horticulture. We have a real problem with these issues across the country. But what happened? We on this side actually did something about it. We established Taskforce Cadena, a multijurisdictional task force which cracked down on those bad seeds in the industry, ensured there were prosecutions and protected workers. What did those opposite do? They had another inquiry. That's what they did when they were in government—another inquiry with no real action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we are talking about looking after workers, the government are absolutely doing those things and we are acting in their interests. Labor, when last in government, cut the staff from Fair Work by 20 per cent. How does that ensure you have fair workplaces and can crack down on foreign worker exploitation and on individuals not being paid the correct wages and superannuation? Let's face facts: that is absolutely what happens. If you don't have that oversight, if you don't have the enforcement, if you don't have these inspectors, if you don't do that work then individuals will take advantage of the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know is we are doing things for workers in this country. We are ensuring that workplaces are as safe as possible. We need to be very careful with our rhetoric in this place when we're discussing those types of issues. We know what happens on the other side. We have a Labor Party now that are completely lost as to what they stand for. You only have to look at Deputy Premier Trad in Queensland, who went out, stood in front of a microphone and said to every single worker in the resources industry that they need to transition out of their job. The best thing we can do for any individual in this country is ensure they're employed and that they have long-term jobs they're committed to, that are highly skilled, well paid and go on until they are ready to retire. It's how they pay for their families, it's how they pay for their kids to go to school, it's how they pay for their house and their needs, and we need to ensure that that continues. Those opposite are completely lost. They no longer stand for working people any more, and I think that is a great shame.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  Six years into the Morrison government, we know they have no economic plan, no plan to turn this economy around and no plan to improve growth across the economy. However, what we do know is that this Liberal-National government are no friend of Australian workers and they love to talk down the organisations of workers. Just in the last speech, they talked about worker organisations being a necessary evil. We had no greater evidence of this government not being a friend of Australian workers than the extraordinary responses from the Attorney-General in question time today in relation to questions on James Hardie and Gerry Hanssen. This government often talks about lawlessness in Australian workplaces. You won't be surprised to hear the party of Work Choices is not interested in lawlessness that involves wage theft, is not interested in laws that protect workers and is not interested in laws that assist in building better workplaces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent most of my working life in the labour movement, working with police on the beat, in counterterrorism, in close personal protection, with the Federal Police Union and with engineering and science professionals across the public and private sector with Professionals Australia and APESMA. The intent of members in those unions was always to make their workplaces better. They wanted their organisations to be successful. Describing those organisations in any sense as evil is absolutely outrageous. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the last six years, as an employer of so many of these great Australians, this government has waged war against its own workforce's pay and conditions, the security of their employment and the value of their work. It's no surprise that wages have stagnated when this government has led the way in suppressing wage growth across Australian government employment. It has tried to silence dissent and gag whistleblowers. It has undermined the certainty and stability of the public sector workforce through relentless outsourcing and labour hire. Expertise across all levels of government has been eroded. The growth of conflicts of interest at every level in the Public Service has been led by a government that has effectively shredded a meaningful Ministerial Code of Conduct. Morale and productivity in these workplaces have dropped through the floor. This what is this Liberal government is like as an employer. This is how it leads by example. We shouldn't be surprised that this is its approach to the rest of the workforce as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes you hear of taking an 'all care and no responsibility' attitude. This government have a 'no care and no responsibility' attitude. While they are prepared to undermine the rights of workers across the country, they have a particular agenda to target the most vulnerable in the workforce. Those opposite won't stand up for workers against weak regulation, but they also won't stand up to improper regulation. As the member for Watson said earlier, in the case of the Registered Organisations Commission, it was found they did not have reasonable grounds to launch the investigation into the Australian Workers Union. It's actual lawlessness from one of their own organisations—an organisation they wish to empower greatly through the ensuring integrity legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is absolutely missing in action when it comes to standing up to lawlessness across our workplaces. It's not tackling wage theft and not appropriately dealing with repeat offenders. Workers must be paid what they're owed under Australian law. It's incumbent on employers of any size to make sure they understand their obligations under the Fair Work Act. Yet this government attempts to blame the award system for recent examples of wage theft. It's pathetic. The award system has been with us for generations. It's not a recent invention. In fact, LNP governments have simplified them to the extent that even those opposite can understand them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's simply not good enough for employers to take seriously their compliance with tax laws, planning laws and health and hygiene laws and then disregard legal obligations to their own workers. Wage theft is employer lawlessness, nothing less. The current attack from this government will only lead to more wage theft as unions are caught up in red tape rather than ensuring that Australian workers are treated fairly.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  This is the sort of matter of public importance motion that you get from an organisation that is controlled by another organisation that has the respect of only 15 per cent of the total workforce and only nine per cent in the private sector. But it's an organisation that nonetheless owns 100 per cent of a political party. The Australian Labor Party are, were and always have been the political wing of the trade union movement. This has real consequences for the country and for the rule of law in particular. They look at the CFMMEU, with its beatings, and say, 'Nothing to see here.' They look at the CFMMEU, with its intimidation, and say, 'Nothing to see here.' They look at the CFMMEU, with its links to organised crime, and say, 'Nothing to see here.' They look at the CFMMEU, with its run-throughs, and say, 'Nothing to see here.' They look at the CFMMEU's multiple contempts of court and say, 'Nothing to see here.' They're the Sergeant Schultz of Australian politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do they do this? They do this because they're addicted to the financial support of the CFMMEU—$4 million since 2013. That represents a quarter of the total money that the CFMMEU has been fined by courts. They have been fined by courts to the tune of $16 million. Not only are they addicted to the money; they're addicted to the instructions of the trade union movement. We can see this in the conduct of the Labor Party since the election. The Labor Party have repeatedly engaged in a political tactic which Annabel Crabb has described as the 'bitch and fold'. We will bring legislation into this place, they will make a lot of noise about it and they will try to amend it, but, ultimately, they will vote for it. They did that with the tax cuts. They did that with national security. They even did it with drought funding. But there is one class of legislation that they will fight like Kilkenny cats not to amend and not to support, and that is any change to industrial laws. Why is that? It is because, as I said earlier, the Australian Labor Party are the political wing of the trade union movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing wrong with trade unions per se. Robert Menzies, the founder of my party, represented trade unions throughout his career as a barrister. While we are thinking about Menzies and celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Liberal Party, I thought it was worthwhile quoting from Menzies about trade unions and law and lawlessness. Menzies said in the 1940s:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Liberal Party stands for good wages and conditions … It believes in Trade Unionism and in the protection by law of the rights secured by wage-earners. And, because it believes in all these things, it stands for a fair industrial law which will be enforced without fear, favour or greaten, against employer and employee alike.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… Law and lawlessness are irreconcilable. The time has come, in this country where the rule of law is so frequently attacked, for law-abiding people to defend the law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those words were true in the 1940s, and they are even more true today in 2019. Labor didn't do anything about union lawlessness in the 1940s, and they are certainly not doing anything about it today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 1940s, union density was over 50 per cent. Today, as I said, it's down to 15 per cent across the board—nine per cent in the private sector. My friend the member for Fowler said that it's important to have unions in industries where the work is dangerous. Let's look at a couple of industries where the work is dangerous and the union density in those industries. Union density in mining is down to 9.6 per cent, and it's down to 8.5 per cent in construction. So, in the industries where the CFMMEU are operating, they represent a tiny fraction of the total workers. Where the unions still remain strong are areas like education and health. You are more likely to hear 'no ticket, no start' in a classroom than on a building site or on a mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that say? It says that the CFMMEU is a criminal organisation. It represents almost no workers in the industries that it involves itself in, and yet it continues to have the political protection of the Labor Party, because it gives them instructions and it gives them money. And so the Labor Party constantly fights against changes to industrial law in this place which would apply the rule of law to working people and give people the right not to be intimidated every day when they go to work, would apply the same standards that we expect from company directors to union officials and would lift the standard and the productivity of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the maritime section of the CFMMEU, we all remember the waterfront, where the maritime workers union said, 'Oh, we couldn't do anything more than nine crane lifts an hour.' After the reforms to the waterfront, the crane lifts were up over 20 per cent. We stand for the rights of workers. They stand for the rights of unions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="282212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  As the member for Watson outlined, this government talks a lot about lawlessness in the union movement. We have heard a lot today from that side about the union movement—how terrible, how scary and how they break the law. We've heard much less about the rule-breaking that rips off ordinary Australian workers. I will grant you that the member for Hinkler has been forced to acknowledge that unions do some good things, and the member for Ryan has been flirting with his own brand of lawlessness here in the chamber this afternoon. But what we haven't heard about is the way this government is failing to look after the interests of workers by allowing them to be underpaid and exploited. That is what is happening out there, and Australians see it and are concerned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home town of Melbourne, we've recently had a succession of high-profile wage theft cases in the hospitality industry. Well-known restaurants, hospitality industry stalwarts, have been underpaying their workers for years. I, like perhaps many of us here in this chamber, started my working life in the hospitality industry. I've worked in the fast food franchise, in a cafe and behind bars. I know that it's hard work, with long, unsociable hours on your feet. It makes family life hard when you're working hours that others are not. And it's uncertain. You're often working on a casual basis and dependent on getting on well with your boss for your next shift. These are not the people who should be cheated out of their wages, yet, on this government's watch, we have case after case of underpayment in the hospitality industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give one recent high-profile example from Melbourne. The MAdE Establishment, which runs the Press Club, Gazi, Hellenic Republic and Jimmy Grants restaurants, was investigated by the Fair Work Ombudsman, who found significant underpayment over a number of years. In fact, the underpayments, they claim, occurred because they failed to correctly apply annualised salary arrangements to some of their staff, including by failing to conduct annual reconciliations to check that workers on annual salary arrangements were paid for overtime and penalty rates were applied. We hear from the employers in these cases that it's all too hard, that it's all too confusing. Well, in these cases, it's the unions that stand up for these workers and make sure they get paid. MAdE Establishment has now back paid $17.8 million to 515 current or former employees. But what a failure of this government that, on its watch, vulnerable workers were systemically underpaid for years and years. Instead of asking why, instead of trying to fix this broken system, this government focuses on trying to shut down the very organisations that support these workers—unions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Australians are onto this government. I've been struck by how, when I'm out and about in my electorate, I am routinely approached by people concerned about low wages and poor working conditions. The people who are approaching me are grandparents concerned about their grandchildren. They know that their grandchildren face a very different working world from the one they held jobs in. They know that their grandchildren are working in a casualised, low-wage environment. They see that their grandchildren aren't going to get the sort of stable working conditions that allow them to take out a home loan with a bank, to have a decent family life or to know that they can take a day off when their child is sick. And they see the government doing nothing about it. They see them coming in here day after day with nothing but smugness and attacks on workers and their unions, with no plans to help protect young workers at risk of exploitation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, another area where workers are being routinely exploited is in the gig economy. Those opposite would have us believe that working in the gig economy is a choice—that people go into these jobs because of their flexibility. That may be the case for a very few, but in the main people are working in the gig economy because they don't have a choice. We know the Fair Work Ombudsman has looked into Uber. Unfortunately, that investigation concluded that the relationship between Uber and its drivers is not an employment relationship, and therefore these drivers are left with no protection, underpayment and no security. Across industry, across jobs, this government is letting down workers, yet I've heard no concern today and no plans to improve the lives of these people. The member for Berowra thinks that we on this side are ashamed to be associated with unions. Well, that is not the case. We stand proudly beside the people standing up for workers, standing up for Australians who want fair work and who want fair wages. This government should be ashamed it's not doing the same.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="245550" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FLINT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  I'm just going to address the member opposite's points. On the matter of unions, they are not working in the interests of their members. We know, for example, that they're spending the hard-earned money of their members on funding the campaigns of those opposite. I don't see how that helps a single worker in Australia. Worse than that, we've heard so regularly from the Attorney-General recently about the disgusting behaviour, in particular of the CFMMEU, that is directed at individual workers in workplaces around the nation. I'm just going to quote from the Attorney-General. And I'll keep putting this on the record because it's important for each and every Australian to understand the disgusting behaviour of the CFMMEU. The Attorney-General said to the House recently, 'One of the very important reasons that unlawful behaviour on worksites must be stopped is that it puts the safety of workers at risk.' These are really important issues. As the Attorney-General went on to say: 'We know that the CFMMEU has racked up $16 million in court fines for unlawful behaviour for over 2,000 breaches. What is less well-known is that many of those breaches themselves relate to violations of occupational health and safety standards.' The Victorian public sector has been targeted and we know that the Queensland Public Sector Union now has a list of 17 sites that they will not let their safety inspectors visit because they don't feel safe, and that's because of union activity on those sites. This is just appalling behaviour. No-one deserves to be treated like this. No-one deserves to feel unsafe in their workplace. We need Australian workers to feel safe when they're working on a government site and most certainly when they are on building sites and other private sector sites that we know the unions and, in particular, the CFMMEU are constantly targeting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what I really want to talk about today is the importance of jobs. You don't have workers when you don't have jobs, and we on this side of House understand that. That is what the Labor Party time and time again fails to remember. When we talk about looking after the interests of Australian workers, we are looking after their No. 1 interest, which is making sure that they have a job. Since 2013, we on this of the House have created over 1.4 million jobs—and we are getting on with the job of delivering 1.25 million more over the next five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last year, full-time employment has increased 2.2 per cent, with more than eight out of 10 jobs created in the last year being full-time jobs. We've lowered the tax rate for small and medium businesses—which employ more than seven million Australians—so that they can grow and employ more people in their communities. We're investing in $100 billion worth of nation-building infrastructure projects, which will create jobs in each and every state across Australia. I'm very fortunate that my electorate of Boothby is seeing a lot of road upgrades and level crossing grade separations, which is creating a huge amount of work in my home state of SA. We're also investing money than $200 billion in our national defence capability, which includes the delivery of 57 new naval vessels—each one being built in Australia, using Australian steel and creating more than 25,000 jobs for hardworking Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only our government is interested in creating jobs for Australians and making sure that our economy is in the position to do so so that businesses can get on with employing other Australians. As a result of our responsible economic management, wage increases continue to outpace increases in the cost of living. Importantly, living standards also continue to increase, with net disposable income per capita rising one per cent—to be 2.7 per cent higher through the year. To support wages growth, our government is setting the right conditions for a strong economy and for jobs growth, and a healthy labour market will help drive wages growth for workers. Also, thanks to our government's plan for lower taxes, workers will keep more of the money they work so hard to earn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite like to lecture us and make all sorts of wild and incorrect claims, but we know the truth: we are the party that are completely focused on Australian workers and on delivering jobs for Australian workers—and we will continue to do so through a raft of different mechanisms, whether it's lowering taxes for small and medium businesses, investing in our defence capability or fixing our roads and busting congestion around the nation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  I rise to support the amendment that is before the House, moved by the member for Hunter, to the Farm Household Support Amendment (Relief Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2019. Let's be frank about where we've got to on the farm household allowance and about this government. The allowance was created when Labor was last in government. It was recognised back then, at the beginning of the drought, that we needed to bring this measure in. This government got elected in 2013, and what is disappointing for a lot of people on this side of the House, as well as farmers and farming communities, is that, since that time, as the drought has worsened, there's been bungle after bungle from this government when it comes to the farm household allowance. Now, when farmers are in the really dark days of the drought, we're seeing this legislation brought before us, trying to patch up the fact that the government have not worked hard enough or early enough to support these families most in need. The worst thing about it is the fact that they were warned. They were encouraged to take action not just by us here in the parliament but by people in their own electorates and their own communities. As we stand here, 600 families have been kicked off the farm household allowance because these changes were not brought to the parliament sooner. That is 600 families who have basically fallen off the cliff in terms of income support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the farm household allowance? It allows farmers who have assets and who are earning income to also claim the Newstart allowance if their income is below a certain amount. It is, it should be acknowledged, a lot more generous than what somebody on Newstart can earn before they start to lose their Newstart allowance. It recognises that a lot of our farmers do have a lot of assets and are earning income but just not enough, because farm enterprises, particularly in some parts of Australia, are very expensive and there is a cash-flow problem that does occur in these houses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does support the changes that have been put forward by the government but really wants to highlight the situation that faces not just the 600 who have been kicked off the allowance and are left without nothing but also the more than 500 who are about lose their farm household allowance and will get a once-off payment of $13,000—so they will get roughly a year of the allowance before they also exit. Meanwhile, everyone else on the farm household allowance will get the allowance for up to 10 years. That's how long this drought could go on. That is a reasonable time frame, because it also allows farming families and farmers the opportunity to decide whether they stay or transition off the farm. But it's very little comfort for those who applied early to the allowance and are now off the allowance; either they've been kicked off or they'll get this once-off payment. It used to happen a lot in enterprise bargaining. A boss would delay negotiations and drag them out, and then, rather than giving people a decent pay rise, would say, 'We'll roll it over and give you a once-off payment.' It's almost bribery money, in a way, to make the issue go away. It doesn't account for the long term. It represents the chaos of this government when it comes to its drought response and support for farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part I'd like to highlight is the lack of support for farm workers, farm contractors and people working in small businesses. I raised this question today in question time, and the response I got from the Prime Minister was, 'Oh, we're helping them in other ways.' But he didn't really go into any detail. He talked about the tax incentives that the government give to farmers, the fact that they're investing in councils and the fact that they're going to help people find alternate work on farms. All of those programs have not demonstrated in any way that they're on the ground helping people on those farms, in those communities, stay in work. I haven't spoken to a shearer who's got work building a fence on a farm. When you talk to farmers about the ability that was introduced in other budget measures for them to claim back these expenses, they say: 'You've got to have the money to spend it. We don't have the money to spend on the drought infrastructure that we could possibly claim back.' These farm workers have left these communities. They might be able to stay for a bit if their partner is in work, but there is a real pressure throughout the supply chain—beyond the farm gate and beyond the farmers themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are always trying to talk about small-business truck drivers and owner truck drivers. Yet where's the support for the owner truck drivers who are the contractors that help to cart the grain, which doesn't exist right now because of the drought? There's no support or recognition for a lot of the small businesses that might be based in town, the people who might help with irrigation, the people who might be the electricians or the plumbers who specialise in farm and on-farm equipment, the jackaroos and the jillaroos or the loyal person who has always worked there—not the backpacker who comes and goes for the fruit-picking season, but the person who's been the on-farm hand or the on-farm manager.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government actually distinguishes these people, if they find themselves unemployed because of the drought, as being on Newstart. So all of a sudden, even though they drew their income and drew their experience from agriculture, they're now put into another category by this government: Newstart. They're now demonised. They now could be subject to drug testing. They are now vilified by this government and placed in a category of 'Newstart'. Yet you talk to a farmer and you talk to that worker and they see themselves in a partnership. Farmers who have got a very close working relationship with their employees say that their farms couldn't survive without these people. Yet, in the government's eyes, that worker is viewed differently even though the drought's impact is the reason they now find themselves unemployed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though the allowance that they're drawing is the same—it's Newstart—that worker is treated differently. When that worker rings Centrelink, they're on hold for a very long time. If they are able to get their phone call answered, then they're struck with all the punitive measures that come with Newstart like every other worker. Yet when the farmer rings up, if they indicate that they're on the farm household allowance, they go straight through. They've got a special helpline. They've got special support. They are assigned a case worker that calls them every two weeks. They get specialised financial counselling to help them out. It's a great support service that we're now starting to build for our farmers and our farming communities. But why can't it be extended? Why can't all people experiencing this drought receive the same support? Why is it just our farmers? Why isn't it the farm workers? Why isn't it the people who work for the small businesses in town? Why isn't it people who live and work in regional communities? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You also have to question why the government isn't rolling out this great support and assistance for people in sectors like manufacturing, with the downturn in manufacturing. When we lose manufacturing jobs, whether it be food manufacturing jobs or jobs that are connected to the supply chain, those workers don't get this special treatment, and there's an argument that they should. Everybody who contacts Centrelink should have the phone answered. Everybody who is seeking the support of a government payment should be treated with respect and given the opportunity to talk to a real person and work through their payment structure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are reasons why so many farmers aren't taking up this allowance. One is the complexity of it. The second is that they have to go through Centrelink and the demonisation of people who use Centrelink. The third is the time frames that the government has put around this allowance. Maybe the 10 years will help attract more to it, but these are people who are proud and who are trying to make a tough decision in their life: do they stay and sit it out, or do they go? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the amazing farming skills and the resilience of communities and farmers who decided early to destock. We don't talk about them enough—the people who had a plan ready for this drought. They learnt from the millennium drought that you had to farm differently. They learnt from the millennium drought that you had to be prepared. They—wherever possible—introduced opportunities into their farming business so that they could diversify their income. And they should be acknowledged, because they have not found themselves in these very difficult circumstances—whilst they're down on their income, they did destock early and they did make sure that they enacted their drought plan. This is something that is not being recognised, and I know that within the drought affected communities it's a point that they really are talking about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to call out the government on their lack of support for regional councils. We've noticed and we've heard in the evidence given before estimates that it was a government decision—an arbitrary decision—about which councils got the $1 million funding and which councils didn't. It was a government decision, a cabinet decision, a ministerial decision about the line where they cut communities off. What we've learnt is that some of the councils to the north of my electorate around the Murray that are drought affected, missed out on funding because they had less than 17 per cent of their people technically employed in agriculture. Those statistics are disputed. How could you say that people who work in the supply chain are not drawing an income from agriculture?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm talking about to the north of me, particularly in dairy country. We've had a lot of dairy farmers stop dairying. They're no longer active dairy farms, a knock-on effect of the supply chain. So, in milk processing, technically those jobs, whether they be at Parmalat or Fonterra, are considered manufacturing jobs, yet the core ingredient is a commodity that comes off the land. Those councils have missed out because of the arbitrary way in which the government has allocated funding. They're still drought affected, they're still struggling, but they missed out on funding. If you look at some of the council areas around the Hunter, to the north of where we are, they missed out on funding because, again, those council areas have a diversity of industries. It doesn't mean the farmers aren't doing it any tougher, it doesn't mean that those regions aren't doing it any tougher, but they've missed out on funding because of this arbitrary 17 per cent. And why is it 17 per cent? Why isn't it 10 per cent? Why isn't it 15 per cent? These are questions that the government won't answer because decisions were made—let's be frank—about money, not people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point that I really wish to highlight in this speech about this kind of homework assignment done at the last minute by the government is that it's actually not a long-term plan. It's not a plan for resilience and it's not really focused on where to next—not in the long term but also not in the immediate term. In my part of the world, it is getting very dry. We did have a good winter. We've had some good rains. We are hopeful that we'll get more rain so that we will have a good crop. But to the west of us and to the east of us it's looking very dry. And our council areas, whilst they're not in the severe drought that we've seen in Queensland, New South Wales and northern Victoria, fear that they could be next. But what planning is this government doing? Now is the time to engage with those councils and those regional communities and enact preparation plans for drought. Now is the time to start investing and awarding those contracts to start to do that on-farm, off-farm work so that they can keep employment going in these regional communities—now, not waiting until they're in the dire circumstances where stock is dying on the land. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that stock is dying on the land and the Army has had to go in to clean it up is awful. It's heartbreaking, it's a disgrace and it's an indictment of this government that it let the situation get to that. Where is its shame about letting it get to the situation where the Army had to go in? It demonstrates the chaos of this government. The fact that we have towns in New South Wales out of water, where parents are bathing their children in mineral water—in water that's been shipped in—demonstrates the government's chaos and dysfunction and how it has let these regions down. The government have shown a lack of leadership. In bringing together the states, in bringing together local governments, they've been the missing partner. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's disappointing that members have stood up in this House and ranted about state governments and talked about building dam infrastructure. That's going to take decades, and there are question marks about whether it will even help. People need help right now, not just farm household assistance but help with the basics. I urge the government to do more right now.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  The Prime Minister very kindly gave me some of his time to talk about the Julia Creek and north-west Queensland floods, and I pleaded with him to go up there and see it. He saw it as a good thing to do, so he went up there. He went, he saw, he acted, and we got an excellent outcome. And I don't think I could use any other word except 'excellent'. I've been a member of parliament through Cyclone Larry, the second worst cyclone in Australian history, and the cyclone that followed it, Yasi, which was very, very bad indeed. But I have seen massive flooding—74 floods. I worked on the flood relief committee as a very young man. So I would use no other word except 'excellent'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing is ever perfect; we forgot about the roo-shooters, the kangaroo farmers. That's a very, very big industry. There are the vegans that we have with us—the brainless class, in my opinion. You've got to explain things to them, but it's a bit of a waste of time. Because there's water everywhere there now, we have a massive kangaroo population and there is enormous pressure on the grasslands, the native grasses, that wasn't there before because the kangaroos weren't there before. With cattle, it doesn't matter too much. With sheep, because we have a drought, the land is spelled for a couple of years. It takes a while for them to build their numbers up again, and we get a reasonably good outcome as far as nature goes. But we do need the kangaroo harvesters in there, otherwise nature's going to get very badly out of balance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said those things, and turning to the bill, I thought the government had a fair bit of an idea, particularly the drought minister, in saying, 'What we're doing for the drought is the family farm assistance.' Well, the ALP did the family farm assistance. It had absolutely nothing to do with the government side of the House. The Rural Action Council—one of the most aggressive and one of the best groups of people I've ever worked with in my life—wanted a drought summit. My own little political party—with Rowell Walton, our president, along with me—secured agreement from Wayne Swan for a drought summit. We wanted a lot of things. We didn't get the drought summit, but one of the things we did get was the family farm assistance grants. We thank very much the Labor government of Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan for a huge breakthrough for rural Australia. I really don't think it helps any of us for the current government to be running around claiming credit for something that the other side did.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Alan Jones has delineated in a very emotional and a very aggressive manner, the cattle numbers are simply vanishing. The cattle numbers are simply not there. We had 32 million head of cattle. We were down to 24 million head of cattle two years ago. Now we're down to 22 million head of cattle. We're not all in love with farmers. They're not some special breed that we all look after like a protected species or anything of that nature. As a cattleman, having had cattle almost all of my life—I'm not cattleman. That's a very honourable thing. I'm not in that category, but I've had cattle all my life. We need money for fodder. The previous speaker, quite rightly, said that the dams are decades away. Well, with her government in Queensland, they're centuries away. They're on another planet, with her government in power in Queensland. It's the worst government I have seen in 50 years in parliament. It's easily the worst government. I would hate to be an ALP member in Queensland at the next election. They were given their notice, they were given their warning in the federal election, and they took no heed of the warning at all. They want to close down the sugarcane industry and they want to close down the coal industry. Queensland only has two industries: cane and coal. And, if there is a third one, it's cattle. We've got as much chance of getting money for fodder from the state government as I've got of becoming the abominable snowman in Bedourie! It's simply not going to happen. They are naive to state that. I plead with the Prime Minister to not go down that pathway. They will never help us, and we know they will never help us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you an example of how they're looking after drought affected farmers in Queensland. There is a tree called mulga—I think that's the technical name for the tree—and it grows in the desert, in country which is called Heartbreak Corner—right out there like the corner of South Australia and the Northern Territory; it's in the corner of New South Wales and Queensland, in the corner which is just getting onto the desert. People forget that 52 per cent of Australia is in the world register of deserts. This is not on desert country, but it's adjacent to desert country. The mulga tree grows very deep roots and survives through droughts and dry times. When you buy a station, you don't buy a station for the dirt. You're not a miner. You buy the station for the vegetable matter upon the land, which the moo-cows or the sheep will be able to eat. Since time immemorial, in the days when there were no whitefellas here, blackfellas broke off the trees, kangaroos would come up to eat the trees and they would catch and harvest them. Today we break the trees, and the moo-cows, sheep and kangaroos come up to eat them, and the tree keeps growing. It's called coppicing. Some trees coppice; some don't. Some you can damage by breaking their top off. But these are not coppicing trees; in fact they flower—that's not the word I'm after. They are much more successful at growing—a crude expression, I know—when they're cut, so continuously cutting them gets more and more foliage. They yield more vegetation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland government is prosecuting Dan McDonald and has fined him the best part of $250,000 because he broke the trees off. We've been doing that for 30,000 or 40,000 years, and he has been fined $250,000. This is the help we're getting from the Queensland government in drought? This is the government we expect to provide us with funds to buy cattle fodder? They believe their greenie wet dreams where, if you have a moo-cow, all the ground collapses and it goes into the ocean and destroys it. I challenge the greenies continually: we can get in a motorcar and drive from Townsville to Mount Isa, about 1,200 or 1,300 kilometres; you can stop any time you like, climb onto the bonnet of the car and look out; and, if you can count more than 2,000 hard-hoofed animals in those 1,300 kilometres, I'll give you $2,000. I don't have a hooknose for nothing; I don't like parting with money! You have just seen something like 40,000 square kilometres and you can't even count 2,000 hard-hoofed animals on it. We do not have intense vegetation, so we have an extremely light footprint.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're here to talk about family farm assistance. We applaud the government for extending that to four years but, unfortunately and sadly, if you want to look at an average figure for droughts—not that there is an average figure—you're probably looking at about seven years. Under intense pressure they have added a cash payment at the end of the four years. We appreciate that as well. But you did not institute this vitally important measure. You did participate, with the ALP, in the sell-off of all of the banks that provided us with reconstruction money. I hate to use that word. Every government in Australian history, state and federal, since the time when King O'Malley set up the Commonwealth Bank, has had a very simple reconstruction approach when farmers get into trouble. All they do is go in and buy the bad debt. The farmers are in trouble, so they pay out the bank. If the farmer owes the bank $1 million, they say, 'Mr Bank, we'll give you the $1 million; we now hold the mortgage.' This protects the government's money, because we now hold the first mortgage. If we take a second mortgage, the government is not protected and almost certainly the government will get none of its money back. So we take a first mortgage. Since we are buying a bad or in-danger debt, we expect a discount. We buy for 100 years in Australia. We bought the farm debt at a discount of 15 to 20 per cent—in that sort of range.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak with authority because I was the minister responsible for the state bank when the sugar industry in Queensland went down, and went down badly. At that time the sugar industry in Queensland was our premier industry, our biggest employer. It was still bigger than coal at that stage. There was a drop to one-third in the price of sugar and it stayed down for two or three years. So we had to consider going in. Even there, you don't go in unless the industry is viable. The government should not be in the business of propping up non-viable industries. Our cost of production was lower than southern Brazil, so we knew we would be the last man standing. We had very solid property values. The sugarcane farms are in the super-wet belt, where it's green—the only part of Australia that's green—and in the area of holiday land, such as Airlie Beach and Port Douglas and all of these places. So we borrowed the money—I think it was at about 2.5 per cent—and, if memory serves me correctly, we loaned out about $700 million. We took all the mortgages. When I was told that I had responsibility for that, I said, 'Like bloody hell—I'm not taking the reconstruction bank. No way. I'm not taking all the cripples.' They said, 'There aren't any cripples.' I looked into it and found that there were only 13 farms that had to be foreclosed on. Over a 10-year period, we had loaned out to thousands of farms, but there were only 13. At the present moment, if you're on $1 million you've got to pay the bank about $55,000 every year. If they've only got to pay interest-only at two per cent then you're coming down to about $16,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there has to be a grant for the fodder. The cattle numbers have gone down from 32 million—this is arguably the third-biggest export earner for this country. After coal and iron ore, the cattle industry is No. 3. We are not doing it to help farmers. As Alan Jones said, we're doing it to preserve for the future this great and wonderful treasure: the Australian cattle herd. It's gone from 32 million down to 24 million two years ago. In the last two years, it's now gone to 22 million. When are we going to act? When it's down to 10 million? How many meatworkers are we going to throw out of jobs? Thousands in Australia. So we need money for fodder, and that's got to be from grants. There's no other way out. The reconstruction board accounts for the debt and should bring almost all of those farmers through. We're not going to bring people through who are stupid and lazy and irresponsible. There's always got to be some people who go down with the ship. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  I've met with dairy farmers in my community and I've listened to how their industry, and the challenges in their industry, are impacting not only on the future viability of their own individual businesses but also on their physical and mental health. So I welcome the agricultural minister's announcement of the early introduction of the mandatory code of conduct, a measure designed to increase fairness and transparency between dairy farmers and processors. While the code is unlikely to be a silver bullet, as some in the industry believe that it will be, I hope that this will help to improve the precarious financial position of our dairy farmers, as detailed in the recent ABARES data on debt in the dairy industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABARES data shows that, in South Australia, the average total farm debt for dairy farmers is around $1.3 million, a substantial debt to service when accompanied by the predicted decrease in farm-cash incomes of around 24 per cent for the 2018-19 financial year. On a national level, the average farm cash income of Australian dairy farmers is likely to decline by around 42 per cent to just $93,000 per farm. Unsurprisingly, ABARES concludes that the major influence on the financial performance of dairy farms is the drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The code is a start but more work needs to be done to ensure the long-term financial viability of our dairy industry and agriculture more broadly. The farm household allowance forms just one part of a possible solution. The allowance currently provides eligible farmers a maximum of 1,460 days, or four years, of financial support during their lifetimes to meet basic household needs. The financial support comes in the form of a fortnightly payment, with modest mutual-obligation requirements tied to the payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the Farm Household Support Amendment (Relief Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2019 amends the farm household allowance scheme such that farmers and their partners would now be eligible to receive the payment for a maximum of four years in every 10-year period. The measure recognises that farmers may face more than one hardship in their lifetime, be it ill health, family breakdowns or long periods of drought. Secondly, the bill increases the income offset provision from $80,000 to $100,000. The income offset provisions allow a farmer who has incurred a family farm loss to have their ordinary income reduced by $100,000 under the allowances income test. Finally, the bill provides a once-off lump sum payment to farmers who have received the allowance for a period of four years prior to 30 June 2020. Single farmers will receive $7,500, while couples will receive a total of $13,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Agriculture has previously stated that the once-off payment is consistent with the aims of the allowance scheme designed to help assess their sustainability to continue, their succession options or, in some instances, their choice to sell. However, an independent review of the scheme prepared on behalf of the department in February this year queried whether the fortnightly payments actually encouraged long-term sustainability. The report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Rebuilding the FHA: a better way forward for supporting farmers in financial hardship</span> made six strategic recommendations, including strengthening the mutual obligation requirement to prioritise a meaningful mutual obligation process and putting the focus on long-term viability and structural change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report recommended a change to the mutual obligation requirements process whereby farmers work closely with the Rural Financial Counselling Service to engage in a viability assessment, and either plan through the current financial hardship and adequately prepare for future financial shocks or, alternatively, exit the industry with dignity. Specifically, it recommended the Rural Financial Counselling Service take on a coaching role, and farmers would be required to meet with their RFCS counsellor every three months to discuss their financial situation. This would result in a tailored and flexible approach to help farmers understand their financial situation and, where appropriate, develop a better business model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, recipients of farm household allowance are required to sign onto a financial improvement agreement negotiated between the farmer and the case officer of the Department of Human Services. The agreement must contain at least one objective and a series of approved activities designed to assist them achieve their goals. Recipients must undertake at least one of those activities. The independent panel expressed concern over the current mutual obligation requirements, believing they would be viewed as a tick box rather than a tool for long-term financial assistance and change. Notwithstanding those concerns, the bill makes no change to the mutual obligation requirements. It may be that the Senate committee will make recommendations following the conclusion of the inquiry process to ensure the scheme meets its dual objectives of income support and structural change, because our farmers do not need band-aid solutions and nor do they want a handout. What Australian farmers need is a comprehensive plan of attack to give them the best chance of a better future. The government should make no mistake: rural Australians are waking up to the hotter, drier, harsher future that awaits them. And they know that the government has no coherent plan to address the medium- and long-term impacts of climate change upon Australian agriculture. If the government refuses to minimise Australia's contribution to climate change then it can at least minimise the impact by helping our frontline farmers to prepare their farming operations for the hotter, drier, harsher future that awaits them. Finally, the government must design and then implement the national strategy on agriculture and climate change that the member for Indi and I raised last week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that we support our farmers. I know that, in my community, our farmers are integral to the culture of our community and what we grow. We are so proud of the fact that we are the food bowl for South Australia—we're the dairy farms, the apple farms, the cherry farms, the pear farms and the strawberry farms; we have some broadacre farming; we have cattle; we have sheep. We want to make sure that, in South Australia, our farming families continue on the land, with the dairy farms, and we want to make sure that those farms continue to exist for generations to come. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  A girl from the city is about to speak about farms, so I ask the forgiveness of any farmers out there if I get this slightly wrong! But I think it's really important that people who live in the cities—as I do, in the geographic centre of Sydney—recognise how much support our farmers need, as they are going through a terrible time currently, in possibly the worst drought we've seen in Australia, but also as they necessarily prepare for the changes in our climate that we're going to see over the next 10 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, from even basic reading, of the extraordinary rise in mental health issues among our farmers. We know of the high suicide rates. We know, all of us, how people are suffering out there. We really do need to give them the support they need, in encouraging the government to make the plans that they will need, to transition as well as possible, in the way that they will need to, over the next decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know Australia generally is getting drier. We're already the driest continent there is. We know that bits of it are drying quite substantially, and, for some parts of Australia, the drought they are currently experiencing will be pretty much the norm. For others, there will be more volatile weather patterns—storms; cyclones, where there weren't cyclones; and more drought. So we know that we're going to see a climate which is changing. In spite of the fact that we've had droughts and flooding rains, the climate was consistent, over centuries, and we know that we're going to see that change quite a bit. So farmers are going to need to make changes, and they know it and they are asking the government for a long-term plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I commend the members who have spoken on that—the member for Hunter, the member for Mayo, the member for Macquarie and the member for Bendigo—and on the need for government to sit down, seriously, in a bipartisan way, and address the long-term challenges of our farming community, because we all lose when our farming community loses. It is such a major part of our economy and such a major part of our identity. We all lose: every time we lose the investment that a farmer has made over decades, when a farm goes, when a farm becomes unviable, we all pay a small part of that price. If large numbers go, it affects us all, financially as well as personally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the Farm Household Support Amendment (Relief Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2019, goes some way to improving what is known as the farm household support amendment. Again, I think it's worth people in the cities understanding what this is. The FHA, as it's called, or the farm household allowance, is an income support payment which supports eligible farmers and their partners who are experiencing financial hardship and is paid at the same rate as the social security payment the Newstart allowance, or at the same rate as youth allowance if the recipient is under 22 years of age. The payment is time-limited. Farmers can only receive the payment for up to four cumulative years over their lifetime, at the moment, but this bill changes that to four years in 10, and that recognises that, in the increasing droughts, in particular, we will find farms that have to face drought several times through their lives, unfortunately, not just once. So that's a good change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Farm household allowance recipients are also granted a healthcare card, which enables access to discounted medicines under the PBS and other concessions, and they can receive a $4,000 activity supplement to pay for approved activities, such as training or professional advice. Recipients required to have a farm financial assessment can receive a separate supplement worth up to $15,000 to assist with the cost of the assessment. So, while they get the health card like Newstart recipients, they will also get some additional payments to help them adjust to and get training for the new circumstances that they find themselves in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this bill, there'll also be an additional payment at the end of the four-year period. When a farm household is cut off after four years, they'll receive a one-off payment worth about six months. So, at the end of that four years, they will get a one-off lump sum payment. So, effectively, it's 4½ years instead of four. Also in this bill is an increase in the amount of income a farm household can earn before it affects their payment. That has been increased from $80,000 to $100,000 a year—again, much, much more than Newstart recipients. The bill also increases the amount of assets the farm household can have—up to $5 million. Again, that is much more than it is for Newstart recipients—and, of course, farmers don't have to apply 20 times a week for jobs either. When you compare the farm household assistance to Newstart, it appears very generous. But, again, I would ask people in considering this to understand the circumstances that farmers find themselves in and the extraordinary ongoing costs they have. Whether their farm is viable or not and whether their farm is in serious drought, their ongoing costs are extraordinary. So they're in a different situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The one thing, though, that does concern me about this bill is that there is no additional assistance for workers who work on the farms. If the farm is downsizing its stock or if its crop is not the ground, or whatever is going on in the farm because of the drought, that means the workers are out of work as well. Workers that come in for the harvest season, workers that work in town, workers that do piecework or workers who work full time on the farm will also be affected by drought, yet they're left just on Newstart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite problematic when you understand how fragile some of these towns are. In good times and bad, the towns change dramatically. They don't have the depth that we have in larger towns where we can as a group, across an economy, see a community through hard times. And good times can kill a town just as much as a bad time. I was down in the Snowy Mountains recently and heard from communities how they are very concerned that Snowy 2.0 has doubled the house prices. People who have lived there for decades were taking the quick cash and moving. So they were actually losing their sense of community because the town was doing well for the short term. Their worry was that, when Snowy 2.0 was finished being built and all those engineers tried to sell up, the land prices would slump again and the town would be in trouble. You see that sometimes in the mining booms as well, where the locals move out because the land prices become so high and, effectively, a town loses its history and its character quite quickly. So good times can be quite damaging in the long run, but so can bad times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you lose your permanent workers who have a connection to the area, they can be very, very difficult to replace. From all of the assistance the farming areas need in bringing in workers for the peak seasons, we know how difficult it already is for them to find the workers they need. So when workers leave town—when they sell their utes, sell their tools and are struggling financially and are forced to move to a bigger town to work—small towns and small farming areas can be substantially damaged. So I would question whether or not the government is right in considering the needs only of the farmers and not of the workers, who are also affected by drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, from a city perspective, we need to understand that this is quite a unique situation—because, when a drought hits an area, it hits the whole area. We had similar situations in cities during the millenium drought, as I now know it is called. My area of Parramatta, in Western Sydney, lost just about every nursery that existed, because the water restrictions meant that no-one could water their garden and so no-one bought plants. Nurseries that had been in business for 30 or 40 years and which supported whole families went broke, with some incredible debts. Some of them are still crawling out of those holes now. Now in Western Sydney, if you want plants, it's basically Bunnings. We lost the diversity, we lost the range and we lost a lot of businesses. But in a community like Parramatta, we have enough depth of other businesses to see us through that. There's individual pain for a number of people, but as a community we have some depth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional communities do not always have that depth. They have large numbers of farm workers, farm machinery goes down and people there lose their jobs, so no-one's shopping at the shop down the road. It becomes quite a downward spiral. It is different. It's very easy when you first hear this stuff to go, 'Hang on, we don't get that.' And we don't get that in cities. We have businesses that go out because of the high dollar. The dollar hits parity and businesses that have been viable for years are suddenly not viable, and they go to the wall for something that is not their fault and something that is cyclical. Again I would suggest to the government that they might want to slightly expand the way they think about cyclical things, because it's not just farmers. But in the case of farmers, the whole community is affected in a way in which we're quite often not in the city.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to return to that point I made earlier about the need for us all to support the farmers in the changes they're going to have to make. I know there are some on the government side who don't believe in climate change. I know there are others who believe it's happening but don't believe that human beings are causing it. I know there are others who think it's happening and that human beings caused it, but there's nothing we can do about it. I believe it's happening and I think we need to act, but even if you're one of those three groups, there are still things that must be done because we must adjust to the reality of it. Even if you don't think we can stop climate change or do anything to stop emissions rising, we still need to work to live in the world of climate change. You can already hear the growing voices around the world against broadacre farming because of the killing of insects and the degradation of the soil. You can hear people saying, 'You can't afford to use 2,700 litres of water on one single cotton T-shirt.' We already see growing criticism against certain sectors of the farming sector who use a lot of water and broadacre farming with lots of pesticides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a nation must recognise how good we are at finding answers to those things. We are one of the most productive cotton growers in the world. I have issues of cotton, as a lot of people do, mainly because of what we do with it after it's grown—we make rubbish stuff and then throw it in the tip. If we actually used cotton for the great fabric it is, it would have 100 years of life, which it should have. There are now companies in the US who have figured out how to recycle cotton by extruding the fabrics like viscose. So there is life after its first use, but that's a different matter. You will hear the growing concerns around the world about really water intensive crops.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are really good at finding answers. Australia is one of the great innovative farming nations, and we are really good at it. I know we're one of the most productive cotton growers. I know we already have drones in the sky that are seeking out the first infestations of pests so that we can reduce the amount of insecticide. We know we are doing water-wise farming. We are good at this stuff. We need to recognise that, as people in cities, and get this government to act a bit more on how we can help our farmers adjust to the future which they're going to have to face. There will sectors that won't be as large as they are now because they just won't be able to be. The pressure will be great. The longer we wait, the greater that pressure will be and the harder it will be to adjust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now is the time, as the member for Hunter says, for both sides of politics to get together with the experts around the country and start sitting down and working out what the world and the different regions of Australia will look like in five, 10 or 15 years, and how to make sure our farming sector in 15 years is as good as it is now. It will be different than it is now in some areas; in some areas it won't be. There will be changes, and we need to plan those changes so that the extraordinary skills we have, the people who have that commitment to the land, the people who have been there for generations and the people who have extraordinary research skills can use that for the benefit of us all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with some representatives of the university sector recently who are working on protein levels in rice. We often hear this about climate change from people who don't understand: that carbon dioxide is plant food and therefore it makes the plants grow faster. Well, it does, but it's like sugar in a human body. Your cells get bigger, but you don't have more nutrients, so you get less protein per kilo. If carbon emissions go up even enough to cause a two-degree increase, we'll have less protein in rice, less protein in wheat. But we have universities in Australia that are working really hard and really well on finding solutions to that by breeding rice which has a higher protein level. We're good at this stuff. This is where we should be. We should be leading the world, exporting our smarts and finding solutions for our farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To all the farmers out there who might be listening to me and thinking 'okay', there's more to it than this. I know there is but, again, I want to say to you all that we are all in this together. We need as a nation our farming sector to be strong. We need the government to act now to ensure that it is. We need the government to recognise the difficulties some of our farmers are going to face in some sectors and act now so the transition from where we are now to where we need to be is as gentle and as effective as possible. There are great opportunities in this for Australia as well because of how good we are at adjusting and because we are incredibly innovative in our farming sector. We should use that. We're good at it, we should be better at it and we should find a pathway for our farmers through to the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265585" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Water Resources, Drought, Rural Finance, Natural Disaster and Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  I thank the member for Parramatta and all those who contributed. I say to the member for Parramatta: it's not about starting; we already have. Proudly, our primary producers are at the cutting edge of science and technology. We have been on this journey since we first put a till in the soil and we have been adapting ever since. In fact, every year, governments and farmers themselves have been contributing over $1 billion in research and development so that we are at the cutting edge of genetics and new seed varieties to be able to adapt, to grow more with less.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important we as a parliament acknowledge the heavy lifting the agricultural sector has already done and will continue to do because we have had to. Our farmers have proven to be the best at that because they have had to be. This fact, obviously, has been highlighted during this quite difficult time of drought. We need to understand this drought hasn't just been the last 12 months. My own electorate of Maranoa in western Queensland and central west Queensland are going into year 8. So the government's response, and, I have to say, that of the government before us, has been around making sure we continue to support those farmers. But addressing drought is like going up a set of stairs—as it escalates, you take another step. Over that seven- to eight-year journey, we have continued to take steps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the steps we have taken has been around the farm household allowance. It's a safety net, as are a lot of our social security payments, to provide the dignity and respect our farmers deserve during tough times. When the Farm Household Allowance was first created, it was created with the premise that if you were a farmer, you would be eligible to receive this payment for three years in a lifetime. Obviously the world has evolved and governments have changed. It was only fitting that we as a government look at this support payment with experts, go and listen to farmers to understand the makeup of it and ask: was it fit for purpose and was it fit for the future? Proudly, Georgie Somerset, the general president of AgForce, the peak agricultural body in Queensland, led that review, and recommended quite clearly that droughts will continue to be more prevalent, and having a three-year in a lifetime limit for a farmer to receive this payment does not reflect the true nature of farming and the hardships they face. It also needs to be acknowledged that the agricultural sector, farming sector, has evolved considerably over the years in being more self-reliant but, again, this is a safety net measure to make sure those most vulnerable in the sector are protected. We've taken that recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, this bill reflects much of that report in making sure that we now change the period that a farmer can receive the farm household allowance to four in every 10 years. We are making sure that farmers understand that we'll be there to support them, not just through this drought but in future droughts as well. It's important to also appreciate, and I think the Prime Minister articulated it very well in question time today, that while we're respecting the review and this legislation is reflecting that review, it's also around the supplementary payments. While we acknowledge that there will be some who have used up their four-year period, we will continue to be agile and we will continue to supplement this with supplementary payments, as was announced only recently—only last week—to make sure that $13,000 per family is provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, if this drought continues—God forbid—and we get to a position in May next year, then we'll continue to be agile. I know that those opposite will work with us constructively to ensure that we get through this drought. These are the agile steps that we'll continue to take with FHA in particular, understanding its importance as part of the three pillars of our drought strategy policy that we have been implementing for some time. It forms part of our first pillar, about the here and now. We understand that having that money in farmers' pockets is giving them the dignity and respect they deserve and need to make strategic decisions. We've complemented it also. Those who go on farm household allowance are given a rural financial counsellor to help them and support them to not only fill out the paperwork but also to create an environment where they can make strategic decisions about their future. We're giving them four years to make a strategic decision about where their business should go and how they can achieve that with professional advice and support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The payment itself is not just about keeping bread and butter on the table; it's about creating the environment, complemented by the rural financial counsellors. We put on an additional 49 of those over the last 18 months to help support the demand of being at the kitchen table, helping our farmers make those decisions, filling out the paperwork, directing them to professional advice and supporting them with financial institutions. It's important to understand that this isn't just a payment; this is also a vehicle in which we are providing an opportunity for our farmers to be able to make the decisions they need to make about their future, their family's future and their business's future in a dignified manner. There are complementary measures around support and training that are also important. It's about understanding that as a key pillar of the here and now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also about keeping money flowing through towns. Over the period of four years, many of the recipients will receive over $120,000 in support from the Australian government, the Australian taxpayer. You've got to understand that it also flows through the local communities. That money is spent at the local supermarket, the butcher, the baker and the servo, and that flows through the town. In a sense, it's also an economic stimulus. When farmers don't have money, they don't spend it unless they really have to, and that's normally on overdrafts. They're able to use this money to keep stimulating the local economies. Also, with respect to the Regional Investment Corporation, there are concessional loans that are saving tens of thousands of dollars, complementing farm household allowance and putting money back into farmers' pockets, so it's going back into the local towns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second pillar is about the community, understanding that the drought extends, as the member for Parramatta articulated, to not just the farm gate but beyond that. The complexities of local economies need to be respected and supported as well, on top of the money that we're providing through farm household allowance and concessional loans, and through the stimulus package, which is directly targeted towards growing the economic base in these communities—getting tradies to build projects for the community with materials procured from a local hardware store. Also, around the mental health piece, it's about making sure it's targeted at a local level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the third pillar of our drought policy that we continue to implement. For the first time, governments have been criticised for being reactionary to drought. This government is the first government to create a fund for the future, for the next drought. We're not only looking at the here and now, through our first pillar and through the communities, in the here and now, but we're also looking to the future—a Drought Future Fund that will pay a dividend every year, in the good and the bad. It's legislated. In fact, the panel will give me that plan in the coming week. That will go out. The panel has been legislated to go out and consult for 42 days amongst the community to make sure that the plan will provide the stimulus that's required to give our farmers the tools for future droughts. That will be through extension work—R&amp;D in particular—by making sure our R&amp;D is targeted around droughts, with extension work to ensure that our farmers take up the tools that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other piece that has been quite important—in fact it has been one that we've driven, around our future approach to tackling droughts—has been tax concessions, through the Farm Management Deposits Scheme, allowing farmers to put away money in a term deposit in the good years, with tax incentives, and bring it back in the hard years to minimise their tax. That's a smart way for farmers to prepare for droughts. In fact I've been able to also get a commitment from the major lenders to allow the farm management deposits to be offset against their term debt, much like, when you can walk into any bank to get a home loan, you can offset your savings against your home loan. It's the same principle. Some of our banks have been better than others. Tomorrow we're having another financial task force with the banks to make sure they are moving towards the creation of these products, because that will also save tens of thousands of dollars for these people who put money away into farm management deposits, putting money back into their pocket and putting it into the communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also provide tax concessions around having write-offs for building infrastructure to store fodder to prepare for future droughts. The Australian taxpayer puts out over $500 million every year in concessions to support farmers to prepare for the next drought. That will complement the future fund. Thirdly, it's about building infrastructure: $3.2 billion has been there, prepared to work with the states, to take their hand, to build infrastructure, to harvest the rain when it comes. That's so important to provide resilience for our farmers to get through one drought to the next but also grow our regional communities. This is an opportunity we can't let go. It's great to see that, finally, New South Wales has taken our hand, and we've announced an additional $500 million to partner with them on two projects. The third one is being planned and scoped as quickly as we possibly can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our drought strategy has been in action for some time. We continue to add to it as the drought escalates. But it's quite clear: it's about the here and now. We cannot forget the here and now. These changes will make sure the here and now is respected both now and in future droughts. We have respected the review that Georgie Somerset and her team undertook and those principles that she has provided, and we will continue to make sure the stimulus we provide to these communities will be meaningful. We ask the states, who also have a responsibility in this, to come with us as well. We have a unanimous and bipartisan approach to drought with the states. They look after animal welfare; we look after farmer welfare. It's important that they take our hand and work constructively on making sure they live up to their responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is one that respects that review. It enacts for the future; it enacts for here and now. It doesn't preclude our continuing to be agile in making sure that those supplementary payments, if required—as we proved last week—will be rolled out until this drought is over. This drought will be over only with considerable rain, and the one thing none of us in this place can do—I haven't found anyone who can—is make it rain. But it will rain. We need to be positive and make sure we do not talk agriculture and regional Australia down. This is so important. While I understand the severity and urgency of what we're doing, we cannot talk down the important role of our primary producers for our nation and their important future. The story of agriculture is, 'Just add rain.' It will, and when it does our regional communities will flourish. This is an opportunity for us to get them there. When it does happen, I can see a bright future not just for regional Australia but for our entire country, because of the significant role that the agriculture sector plays for this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that, while the emotion is there and raw and real, we must make sure it's kept in check. We understand that there are bright futures, and we need the next generation to come through and be as proud as their forefathers of what they produce in this country. I believe we're setting the foundation stones for that to happen with our drought policy in the here and now and in the future, and with the rest of the work we've done around the agricultural sector. This is another piece to that complex puzzle of addressing drought, a very complex natural disaster that needs a specific approach. That's what this government does. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

So the immediate question is that the amendment be agreed to—and I'm grateful that the screens now reflect that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment Bill 2019 amends the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 to give effect to the government's decision to implement recommendations arising from the review of the impact of the TEQSA Act on the higher education sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This review was conducted in line with section 203 of the TEQSA Act, which required that the minister, before 1 January 2016, cause a review to be started of the impact on the higher education sector of the TEQSA Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 2015, terms of reference for the review were determined, with Deloitte Access Economics engaged to undertake the review between July 2016 and March 2017. The review was a substantial body of work: 36 written submissions were received, 33 stakeholders were interviewed, and the TEQSA Act was extensively analysed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, the review was positive about the establishment of TEQSA as the national regulator in 2012, noting that the TEQSA Act is broadly operating effectively and as intended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review noted that the higher education sector's views regarding the regulatory system established by the act, and TEQSA as the regulator, are positive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sector sees in TEQSA a regulator that is seeking to reduce the burden imposed by its activities, tailoring its requirements to meet individual features of providers and engaging more fully with the sector. The review therefore did not recommend changes that would significantly alter the regulatory framework or the role of TEQSA as the independent national higher education regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recommendations made by the review are largely technical in nature. They are designed to place TEQSA and the regulatory and quality assurance system established by the act on a stronger footing. This bill gives effect to the review recommendations that require amendments to this act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures contained in this bill will improve the already effective and efficient higher education regulatory system, enabling the sector to continue its focus on delivering the highest quality teaching, learning and research, maximising the quality of educational outcomes for students and protecting Australia's international higher education reputation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill simplifies the legislative framing of the Higher Education Standards Framework by removing references from the TEQSA Act to specific categories of non-threshold standards that have never been made and are not needed. The capacity to make additional standards will be retained, however, if the need ever arises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill requires that TEQSA inform the minister and the Higher Education Standards Panel before it undertakes quality assessment under section 60 of the act that engages the majority of higher education providers. This will ensure that the resource implications of any such activity and the regulatory burden it would create for providers are appropriately considered before undertaking such an assessment. This amendment will remove the need for the current tougher restriction placed on such assessments by Ministerial Direction No. 2 of 2013, which the government will repeal once the amendment act commences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are amendments made in relation to the Higher Education Standards Panel. The bill will expand the skill set that the minister must ensure is encompassed by panel members so that, collectively, the panel has contemporary experience in the provision of higher education by both university and non-university providers. This amendment is important for the panel's oversight and regulatory roles, ensuring its advice is balanced and reflects a collective understanding of issues relevant to different service providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also expands the functions of the panel to more appropriately reflect its role to provide oversight of TEQSA's strategic and operational planning and approaches to deregulation, which were functions of the former TEQSA Advisory Council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A new provision will allow TEQSA to disclose higher education information about a regulated entity to a person who has lodged a complaint where TEQSA is satisfied that the information to be disclosed relates to the subject matter of the complaint. Currently TEQSA can publish such information but cannot disclose the information to individual complainant students. This amendment will improve TEQSA's capacity to respond appropriately to complainants, facilitating better engagement between TEQSA and students of higher education providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill provides for a number of technical amendments, mainly suggested during the review, including minor adjustments to the capacity to disclose both higher education and personal information to the Department of Education and to the minister, to facilitate the disclosure of information for research purposes with appropriate safeguards and to clarify quorum provisions for meetings of the commissioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  I rise to speak on the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment Bill 2019. This bill makes some changes to the higher education agency, TEQSA. These changes flow from the recommendations of the Review of the Impact of the TEQSA Act on the Higher Education Sector, commissioned by the government in 2016. It's important to note that the review of the TEQSA Act did not find any major failings in TEQSA's operations, and I thank the TEQSA staff for the great work that they do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provisions proposed in this bill aim to strengthen and simplify the act to improve the functioning of TEQSA. The changes include: simplifying the legislative framing of the higher education standards framework by removing some specific categories of non-threshold standards, such as the teaching and learning standards, the research standards and the information standards, that have never been made and are not needed, but retaining the capacity to make additional standards if the need arises; removing references to the research minister—that is, the minister responsible for the Australian Research Council Act 2001—in provisions that relate to appointments and acting appointments of TEQSA commissioners and panel members, and to the functions of the panel, and requiring that advice on new standards need only be sought from the research minister if the minister is not also the research minister; requiring TEQSA to advise the minister and the panel before it undertakes a quality review; amending the offence provisions of the act to reflect that an overseas university not registered by TEQSA can offer a course of study that is not wholly or mainly provided from Australian premises, and using the word 'university' to represent its operations without committing an offence; amending quorum requirements for TEQSA meetings to require a majority of commissioners; and expanding the skill set that the minister must ensure is encompassed by the Higher Education Standards Panel members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new provisions will require the minister, when appointing members to the panel, to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… ensure Panel members collectively have contemporary experience in the provision of higher education by higher education providers that are universities and that are not universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes also include expanding the functions of the Higher Education Standards Panel to more appropriately reflect its role to provide oversight of TEQSA's strategic and operational planning and approaches to deregulation. The changes improve the information-sharing and disclosure provisions to allow TEQSA to operate more effectively by: providing that it is an exception to the offence of unauthorised disclosure or use of information if the entity the information relates to has consented in writing to the disclosure or use; allowing TEQSA to disclose higher education information to officers in the department in addition to the secretary, and to also disclose personal information that relates to TEQSA's functions to the minister, a member of staff of the minister, the secretary or to officers in the department; allowing TEQSA to disclose information for research purposes; and, finally, allowing TEQSA to disclose information to a complainant in relation to a complaint without the consent of the body to which the information applies, provided TEQSA is satisfied that the information relates to the subject of the complaint. As I said earlier, these amendments are designed to strengthen and simplify the act to improve the functioning of TEQSA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">TEQSA was established by the Gillard government in 2012. It is Australia's independent national quality assurance and regulatory agency for higher education. The TESQA Act required that the minister cause a review to be commenced before 1 January 2016 on the impact on the higher education sector of the TEQSA Act. The former Minister for Education and Training determined the terms of reference for this review. Deloitte Access Economics undertook this review between July 2016 and March 2017. It was an extensive review. Thirty-six written submissions were received, 33 stakeholders were interviewed, and the TEQSA Act was extensively analysed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review was positive about the establishment of TEQSA as the national regulator. It noted that the TEQSA Act was broadly operating effectively and as it was intended. The review did not recommend changes that would significantly alter the regulatory framework or the role of TEQSA. The review recommended amendments to the TEQSA Act that are designed to improve the act's administration, strengthen TEQSA's regulatory role, and better reflect the role of the Higher Education Standards Panel as the statutory advisory body established under the act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this bill. It makes some minor changes to the operation of TEQSA that will improve and strengthen the functions of that body. What is concerning is that the recommendations of the review of TEQSA, to which this bill responds, were provided to the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government almost three years ago. The coalition government is now in its seventh year. Why has it taken the coalition government so long to implement the sensible set of recommendations from that review? It's typical of this government's treatment of Australia's world-class higher education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the only interest this Morrison government has in education is to cut. The education sector has had six years of cuts and chaos. Students have been hit particularly hard. They now have to pay off HELP debts sooner—putting more pressure on their household budgets. At the same time, they are desperately trying to compete with property investors to buy their first home. Universities are turning away students after this Liberal government capped places, leaving regional and outer suburban communities worse off. At the 2017 MYEFO, the government went after research—ripping $328.5 million from university research, which will devastate our critically important research sector. If Australia is to succeed in this Asian Century, we need to broaden participation in higher education, not reduce it. We also risk being left behind when other similar economies in our region are boosting their investment in science, research and higher education. This government is doing exactly the opposite: capping  undergraduate places, slashing research, cutting vocational education and training, and leaving 2.5 million public school  students in this country worse off by failing to properly fund public education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows that education, at all levels, is the key to our future prosperity and to a stronger society. As I said, Labor supports this bill but I wish to move the following amendment. I move:</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Defence Industry</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  I thank the member for Moreton for his contribution. The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment Bill 2019 amends the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 to give effect to the government's decision to implement recommendations arising from the review of the impact of the TEQSA Act on the higher education sector. The review recommended amendments to the TEQSA Act that are designed to improve the act's administration, strengthen TEQSA's regulatory role and better reflect the role of the Higher Education Standards Panel as the statutory advisory body established under the act. In combination, these recommendations will improve the regulation of Australia's higher education act. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Moreton has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question before the chair is that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Moreton be agreed to.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="LTU" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  I rise this afternoon to contribute to the cognate debate on the Education Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2019, the VET Student Loans (VSL Tuition Protection Levy) Bill 2019 and the Higher Education Support (HELP Tuition Protection Levy) Bill 2019. These bills seek to introduce a tuition protection scheme for students who use student loans to pay for vocational education and training and higher education courses at public and private providers, including TAFEs, in cases of provider or course closure. The measures contained in the bills were first proposed by the Liberal government in the Midyear Economic and Fiscal Outlook, MYEFO, in 2018-19.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say up-front that Labor will not seek to oppose these bills. Students should be protected and assisted in the case of provider or course closure. We welcome the practical effect, which is to create simpler arrangements for some students and processes for decision-making, student placement, and VSL and HELP loan recrediting. However, as with all things, the devil is in the detail. This government seems incapable of managing detail or the detail is full of devils.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nearly all the stakeholders in the sector support the intention of these bills but have noted concerns with the legislation. TAFE Directors Australia, or TDA, have summarised it best. The three bills, they say, 'fail to establish a coherent approach for the operation of tertiary education in Australia,' and we agree. The tertiary education sector is a mess. But specifically, the TDA have also raised concerns over the requirement for TAFEs to take on students who may have received less than adequate training at a failing provider. They note TAFEs should be given the right to reject students or force them to start the course afresh if there's evidence of poor training practices against the training package requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's face it. We've all heard about the lack of quality and rigor of some providers. These concerns are legitimate and they're not an indictment on the students but on those providers who sought to exploit the system at the expense of their students. The TAFEs can actually incur penalties if they do not accept students and to force them to take students who are either bound to fail or who need to start all over again is a major problem that is not dealt with by these bills. It's not fair to either the TAFE or the students to raise expectations that are simply not deliverable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Independent Higher Education Australia raised concerns around the lack of coverage for fee-paying students. Under this legislation, students who fully fund their own education will not be protected by the government in the same way that students with a loan are. IHEA note that, if the government doesn't assure these students, providers will be required to go to market to source their own tuition protection insurance. This means that: 'There is no guarantee that they'll be able to access an appropriate scheme after 1 January next year,' and this is deeply concerning. Ironically, as IHEA point out, entrenching of different protection arrangements for different cohorts of students creates significant additional regulatory requirements on providers who are registered and accredited Australian education businesses. So, for a government who loves to talk about cutting red tape, here they are adding more to higher education and vocational education providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from the concerns for the providers, there is still no protection for the students themselves—those who opt to pay upfront and, through no fault of their own, find themselves left totally in the lurch. I've spoken with young people devastated, after paying all or part of their fees, to have to try to find money to start over again when their providers fail them. We are talking thousands of dollars lost, down the drain. It's a lot of money to a young person, or to an older person who finds themselves having to retrain to re-enter the workforce. When a person, particularly a young one, starts a course, they are filled with hope and excitement about the future, about where their hard work gaining a qualification will get them. And it's hard to cope, watching their disappointment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understands that this legislation is designed to deal with the loan scheme specifically, but the government must address these valid concerns. They can't ignore full-fee-paying students who may be left in the lurch through no fault of their own. The Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia, or ITECA, have noted that the levy will likely be passed on to students. They are frustrated by the growing trend of government cost-recovery programs and schemes in the higher ed and vocational training sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have referred these bills to committee, to ensure that these concerns are addressed and so that stakeholders, both provider and student, have a chance to have a say about these issues, so that we can indeed examine the shortfalls and the broad implications of the legislation. But, more broadly, this legislation is just a tweak to a sector that requires a genuine reform package.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals have trashed the quality of Australia's world-class higher education system and vocational education system. They have cut billions of dollars from universities by recapping undergraduate places, and they've slashed research funding. They have torn out funding from under TAFE and training, let apprenticeship numbers freefall and presided over a national shortage of tradies, traineeships and apprentices. Apart from the $3 billion they have cut from TAFE funding, we've found, in a new report released just this week, that the Prime Minister and this government have short-changed TAFE, training and apprenticeship programs by an almost $1 billion underspend. Is it any wonder that, under this government, our TAFEs are in disrepair and apprentice and trainee numbers have fallen off a cliff?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They keep referring to what happened in Labor's time. Well, we were actually trying to stop a well-used rort by employers who were putting trainees through certificates—sometimes, without the employee's knowledge—using dodgy providers. And we stopped that, quite rightly. But, you see, we had a plan—a plan to revitalise the public provider, TAFE, restart the VET system and rebuild the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has learned nothing. It has no plan to rebuild and revitalise. Numbers have fallen to a lower point than a decade ago. They can't keep blaming everyone else. They can't keep blaming anyone other than themselves. 'Oh,' said the Prime Minister today in question time, 'there's nothing to see here,' when he was asked about this underspend, 'because it's a demand-driven system. We pay on demand,' he said. 'We pay everything that is asked of us.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He said the same about the massive NDIS underspend. The same trickery applies here. No-one believes that all the NDIS clients are getting what they need. We all know how many people are being left in the lurch by the NDIS. They can't get equipment, can't get services, can't get their plans renewed and can't even get anyone on the phone to help them. There are families who can't get respite for their children and who tragically end up relinquishing them to the system, something that any normal person would find not only heartbreaking but completely unacceptable—normal people, I say, not those opposite. They don't seem to care. They just want to bank the leftover billions into their surplus account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nor do they care about vocational education and training. Do they really think anyone believes that the underspend is because of lack of demand? They are kidding themselves if they do. Youth unemployment is at an all-time high. Employers who are desperate for skilled workers can't get them; 75 per cent of employers are telling us that they can't get skilled workers for their businesses. Kids who would love an apprenticeship or a traineeship could fill those skills gaps in a minute. I know young people who would jump at the offer of a decent future with a qualification for life. And employers would employ them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Cooper, I have manufacturers in textile, clothing, footwear, food production and the automotive industry. I have businesses that are desperate for skilled workers, and they see me every other week and tell me they can't get them, and they would in a minute snap up people on traineeships and apprenticeships. I have parents, young ones and—we mustn't forget—older workers needing to reskill telling me every day that they would jump at a training opportunity. So don't tell me and don't tell the people of Australia that the demand isn't there. It's complete rubbish. By saying so, the Prime Minister is misleading the Australian people. They are underspending on vocational education and training the same way they are on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and it is totally on purpose. They are chasing a surplus at the expense of people with a disability and people desperate for a qualification and a job.    Australians deserve excellent TAFEs and universities. They deserve a first-class tertiary education. They deserve the skills that the state can provide. And they deserve a decent, high-quality job. But it seems that the government doesn't think that's true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of overzealous application of competition policy and privatisation in the VET sector, coupled with chronic underfunding, has had devastating effects on the sector. Under the Liberal government, there are 150,000 fewer apprentices and trainees and a shortage of workers in critical services, including plumbing, carpentry, hairdressing and motor mechanics. The number of Australians doing an apprenticeship or traineeship is lower today than it was a decade ago. There are more people dropping out of apprenticeships and traineeships than finishing them. There are myriad reasons why that is happening, and the government is not addressing any of them. There has been a nearly 10 per cent increase in the number of occupations facing skills shortages. As I said before, they have slashed $3 billion from TAFE funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In too many towns and regional centres across Australia, TAFE campuses have closed, courses have been scaled back and fees have increased. We have heard recently that the Alanvale Campus of TasTAFE in Launceston is possibly closing. How can we let that happen? If anywhere needed a properly funded TAFE, it's the north of Tasmania. Young people in regional areas, keen to stay near home and family or unable to afford to move away to study, benefit greatly from regional TAFEs enabling them to gain skills that give them a start in life. Regional TAFEs are often the hub of a regional town's community. They offer employment. They offer business to local enterprises. They bring communities together for events and provide an oft-needed boost to morale. This abject failing of the government has a real effect on people's lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Industry Group, as I said before, has a survey that found 75 per cent of businesses are struggling to find the qualified workers they need. This isn't about young people not wanting to work, as the government and some media outlets would have us believe; this is about training and skilling opportunities simply not being available where they are needed. This government is not supporting industry and workers to get the skills they need. So, while businesses are crying out for more trained staff, there are about 1.9 million Australians who are unemployed or underemployed. Why isn't the Prime Minister taking more responsibility for getting these people into jobs in industries where there's a shortage of workers? It can't be rocket science. I think it's because the Liberal government see this simply as a cost—a threat to their precious surplus, just like the billions of dollars that they underspent in the NDIS and just like they cut funding to TAFE and training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister makes noises, and lots of them, about how important the sector is, how we need to encourage enrolments and how we need to get people to take up courses. Well, what is the minister going to say to the young people in Launceston? Maybe she'll say that one of her industry training hubs will do the trick—the hubs that we hear so much about from the other side. Labor will support any measure that gets young people into training and into jobs, but we need a lot more than 10 hubs. I'd really like to know exactly what the hubs are. Is it a person? Is it a building? Is it an institution? How will it get the kids into TAFE courses if there aren't any TAFEs or vocational education and training providers around the hub? And how do they plan to get them into decent, secure work? We're a little bit scant on the detail of this brilliant idea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People and businesses need a skills training sector that is properly funded, properly resourced and has educators who are properly trained—and properly paid, I might add, through decent jobs—with the ability to skill these kids and unemployed adults as a pathway to meaningful employment. The government haven't delivered on a single element of those. Day after day, I hear of young people who do their best. They're trying to skill up, they're trying to get a job, but they're up against a system which is actively pushing them away. They're up against funding cuts and a government that are actually hostile towards vocational education, and, by extension, a government that are dismantling the already limited pathways for young people to gain employment. They're simply not tackling the problem full-on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest statistics from the ABS show that we have a youth unemployment rate of 11.8 per cent, and we know that it's so much higher in many of our regional areas. That's around 295,000 young people who are actively searching for work but are coming up short. Interestingly, as I said, I've been meeting with employers in my electorate and around Victoria who are crying out for skilled workers. They can't get them. Manufacturers, people in food production, disability equipment manufacturers, and many more are all worried about how they will attract a productive and skilled workforce. This is not simply because nobody wants these jobs; this is symptomatic of a skills shortage crisis gripping Australia. Maybe, and I'm just speculating here, young people aren't gaining the skills needed to take up these jobs because this government have cut $3 billion from vocational education. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that their $525 million skills package includes only $54.5 million of new funding. Maybe it has something to do with the continued funding cuts, the closure of TAFE campuses around Australia or the government's refusal to listen to the sector, to young people or to educators screaming out for real investment. The government's answer to all this is a few hubs. We're not sure what they are, as I said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the government have hired Scott Cam. Scott Cam has been snapped up by the government to promote trades to Australia's young people. Don't get me wrong: I'm absolutely sure he's a good bloke and I take no offence at the promotion of trades. He is a role model. Young people should be taking up trades and we should be promoting secure, decent jobs in trades. I do, however, find it shocking that the government are paying a National Careers Ambassador—I don't know how much—while they cut $3 billion from the sector, and underspend by nearly another $1 billion; while they see fit to cut all of that money from vocational education and training, to cut funds from group training organisations, to cut TAFE funding, and to put educators out of work; while their policies have caused the number of apprentices and trainees to fall by 150,000; while they have let apprentices in this country be more likely to drop out than finish. And, even when all of that is true, when all of this is happening right around them, when there is a perfect storm coming their way with regard to skills shortages and youth unemployment, what do they do? They hire a celebrity. Great! Just great! At least this announcement provided some comic relief from the reality of this government's plan for employment and skills training in Australia, because the situation we currently face is an indictment of this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are simultaneously experiencing a crisis in youth unemployment and a crisis in skills shortages. It is bad enough having to deal with one of these, but both of them at the same time is hard to imagine. If we continue down this path, we will severely jeopardise our future economic growth, we will undermine the opportunity for individual Australians to meet their full potential and, very importantly, we will compromise our ability as a nation to compete with the rest of the world, using the skills, knowledge, discoveries and inventions of our people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that nine out of 10 jobs created in the future will need a post-secondary-school education, either TAFE or university. So we need to increase participation in both universities and our VET sector to make sure that we as a nation are prepared for the world of work. This third-term government simply refuses to deliver a genuine reform package that overhauls the higher education sector and properly funds both vocational training providers and universities to deliver the services their students need. Consequently, I move:</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  I am absolutely pleased to rise tonight to support the member for Cooper's amendment, because every word of it is true. Labor find ourselves in this position: after six years, this government is finally taking some action in an area that we've been asking them to take action in for at least six years. They are finally bringing in a piece of legislation that will help, practically, to alleviate some of the stresses faced by students, particularly where they could potentially have a debt without certification. So Labor will not oppose this legislation. We will, however, take the opportunity to remind the government of its failures in this space—and we're not alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While key stakeholders largely support the intention of the bill, some have expressed concerns which do need to be taken into consideration and which are worth highlighting this evening. Notably, Independent Higher Education Australia has concerns around the lack of coverage for fee-paying students, and of course, amongst those fee-paying students, there are going to be international students. TAFE Directors Australia have concerns around the requirements to take on poorly trained students in the event of course closures, and of course they do, because they would be being asked to work triple time to bring those young people—or those people, if they're mature-age students—up to speed at their expense while somebody else walks away. Further, the Independent Tertiary Education Council of Australia have raised concerns regarding providers eventually passing the cost of the levy, this cost recovery measure, onto students. These are genuine concerns coming from the peak bodies in this sector. In order for those concerns to be properly considered and addressed Labor will refer the bills to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee for an inquiry to do some due diligence and ensure there aren't unintended consequences in other areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Students in vocational education and training and higher education are increasingly facing high amounts of stress and pressure, with many having to balance their coursework with jobs and outside commitments just to stay afloat. These bills address the question of how to best protect students who use loans to pay for vocational education and training. They are part of an ongoing effort required to counter the increases VET FEE-HELP has caused in course fees and unrecoverable student debt. The bills will have tangible and practical effects on the lives of students who access loans to pay for vocational education and training and higher education courses. They will create simpler arrangements for students in student placement and VSL and HELP recrediting. Further, they seek to protect and assist domestic students who are taking out a loan in the event that the provider where they receive their education closes or if their course is discontinued.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Liberals, Labor values the vital role that a properly funded VET sector plays in driving our economy and enhancing our industry. Unlike those opposite, Labor understands the critical role of TAFE as a public provider, the value of skills and apprenticeships and the value of hardworking and passionate public TAFE teachers. This government has, time after time, let this sector down. As the member for Cooper put it, they have gutted this sector with their cuts. Since this government was elected six years ago, universities have faced constant cuts, with attempts at fee deregulation, policy chaos and uncertainty and the threat of $100,000 degrees. They've done exactly the same in TAFE. We now find ourselves in a space where this government knows full well that it's lost 150,000 apprentices on its watch. It stands here in question time with soaring rhetoric about the 80,000 apprenticeships it's going to create, without a TAFE sector to assist in that process, with the TAFE sector decimated, with state governments scrambling to find ways to rebuild the TAFE sector at the state level. We know that, without a strong TAFE and VET sector, and unless young people and those wanting to retrain have access to appropriate quality training, the 80,000 apprentices are an absolute dream.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I raise my real concern about what this means for fee-paying students. In my electorate that's international students. I want the government to think carefully about those in this space. We often hear excitement and celebration from both sides of the chamber about higher education where international students come to Australia to study. We hear huge figures about what this industry is worth to this country. I want to go through a few of those figures. At the moment in VET we have 194,600 international fee-paying students in this country. They're not going to get any support from this piece of legislation. In higher education we have 430,000, a lot more. I want the government to think about what it means if international students aren't covered by this. They're open to being exploited and to being enrolled in courses that aren't going to deliver the quality of certification that we're assuring for our domestic students who take out a loan. I want the government to think about what long-term impact that may have on the international reputation of an industry that is of high dollar value to this country and, more importantly, is creating well-paid, high-quality jobs in the education sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:14.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />I would want to see this looked at by the Senate inquiry, because in my electorate we have many international students who are studying and who are studying in VET providers. I want to make sure that (a) they are getting the quality that they're paying for on entry into the country and (b) we're not put in the situation where the risks being taken there actually have an impact on the higher education sector, where we have double the number of students coming to this country. Government needs to know that, internationally, people think Australia is a destination for international students for higher education—in the university sector and in the VET sector. The two go together in the eyes of those countries that are accessing them, and there is a real risk here that we are not providing the same guarantee to our international students, and that would put the industry at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Liberals, Labor values the role of a properly funded VET sector and the vital role it plays in driving our economy and enhancing our industry. We understand how important it is to have domestic students trained and to have people ready to take up the trade positions that are available. We know that we have a skills shortage. We know that, because we keep hearing about it. We know it, because business tells us so. We know it, because you can't engage even with small business in my community without them raising this issue, without them asking me about it. I met with someone who worked in my electorate for years as a carpenter, who had apprentices most of his life, and he said to me just the other day: 'Jo, what's happening in this sector? There's no clarity. No-one seems to be able to tell me how you become an apprentice these days or how you become a tradesman these days.' There is no clarity, because this government is asleep at the wheel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have plummeting TAFE enrolments while the fees skyrocket, and yet the Liberals seem to question why more students aren't choosing to pursue vocational education and training. They're busy having a culture war. It's all about the rhetoric. They come in here and say: 'You don't need a university degree. You should just go and study at VET.' People should be tradesmen—notice the 'man' on the end of that sentence! People should be getting a trade. Well, what's the government doing about ensuring that there are facilities available across our electorates so that young people and people who want to retrain can access them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if it solves some of the problems in youth unemployment—if it's funded properly, if the certification is ensured, if there is a guarantee that young people are getting value for the money that they're spending, if there are jobs in the areas where they are being trained—it's still not really going to help. It's still not going to assist the fact that the highest newest emerging number of people who are now homeless are women over 55, who I don't think are going to retrain, motivated by Scott Cam, to become a carpenter. And it's not particularly going to help the people in my electorate who are over 55 who may have lost their jobs because of the Toyota closures. It's not particularly going to help them to have Scott Cam telling them that they can now become a carpenter at 55.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems to me that this government has completely lost its way in terms of the vocational education and training sector. I think the answer is really simple. I think the answer is because none of them know anything about it. None of them have been exposed to it. None of them spend any time with the people involved in it. I think that's really what's going on here. As someone who has worked in education for 27 years, who has been close to this sector, it is of critical importance. It's important that our young people trust that, if they take out a loan to seek to get a certification, it's going to lead to a job and there is going to be a meaningful transition. What we know on the ground, what I know in my electorate from people who support students into transitioning meaningfully into work, is that young people need support in that area and that TAFEs used to be part of that program. Our public TAFE sector used to ensure that people were connected. They assisted young people who had completed their training in securing that. They also had a good nose about where the skill shortages were.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government, they have completely lost their way, and nothing tells us that more than seeing the latest marketing ploy employed by this government. You have the rhetoric on one hand and then you have a marketing ploy on the other, and the marketing ploy, of course, is Scott Cam. I've heard many in this place say that they know that Scott Cam is a good bloke. I don't know if he is a good bloke, because I've never met the man. So I'm not prepared to say he is if I don't know. But I've got nothing against the man except this: under the last Prime Minister—remember him?—Malcolm Turnbull, we had the 'fake tradie' and now we've got the celebrity tradie. It's just marketing 101 wheeled out again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Scott Cam is not going to motivate young people in my electorate to pursue a trade. How on earth is he going to connect to them? What are we doing here? What message is this sending to our media-savvy youngsters? Is it: 'Do a trade so that, when you retire, you can become a television celebrity'? What sort of message is that? Young people aren't stupid. They're far from stupid. Young people want to know, specifically: 'Where are the shortages? Where will I get a job?' Then they want to be able to access a certification or get an apprenticeship first and get their certification—whichever way it works.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been here for six years and, for six years, I've heard that we've got skills shortages in areas where it is stupefying to think that we've got a ramping-up in skills shortages, a decrease in apprenticeships and the destruction of the public VET sector. It is absolutely insane. If this government really want aspiration, they need to understand (a) how young people in the suburbs think and (b) the connection and how media-savvy young people are. In my electorate, I know young people will seek the certification if the certification is going to lead to a job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That leads me to the last point that I want to make in terms of this government's track record in this area. Across the last 12 years, I suppose, we've spent money on trade training centres and we've spent money on Australian Technical Colleges—the Howard years Australian Technical Colleges—and nowhere can I find anybody with a view of how VET in schools is interacting with the certification happening post school. I've got lots of young people in my electorate who tell me that they've got a certification, a cert III in a particular area, only to find that, when they walk out into the real world, there is no skills shortage in that area. Who's looking at the way these two sectors interact? Who's looking at what we put on the ground in terms of facilities across those spends in schools and in communities, with stand-alone Howard colleges? Who's looking at those and what they're doing? Who's checking to see what's being taught in those facilities? Who's checking to see whether those facilities are in need of a refit and whether we could refit them into areas where we've got skills shortages? I am very tired of hearing young people tell me that they're shattered—that they did VCAL in Victoria and they've got a cert III, and now they're being told they need to do a cert II in a completely different trade.</span>

Labor has always sought to protect students working hard to get a high-level qualification, because higher education, whether in the university system or in the TAFE system, is an expensive undertaking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian governments have long sought to support students to undertake higher education through the provision of a world-leading student loan system—either VSL or HELP—because we know that it is good for our economy, good for business and life-changing for students who gain further education after high school. Anything we can do to ensure students can complete their qualification, even if their training provider disbands, is a good thing to do. These bills seek to introduce a tuition protection scheme for students who use student loans to pay for vocational education and training and higher education courses at public and private providers, including TAFEs, in cases of provider or course closure. Unfortunately, as has become typical with this government, though, these bills are a bit sloppy and there remain concerns on how the bills will operate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As outlined by my Labor colleagues, including the shadow assistant minister for skills, the sector is concerned that the legislation will not operate as it needs to. Fee-paying students aren't covered by this legislation, and Labor believes that these students should be able to obtain the same protection as those who have a government loan. The sector is concerned that some of the costs of the levy associated with these bills will be passed on to students. TAFEs are also concerned that they will be left to pick up the pieces when students come to them with poor training from a since-closed institution. The process for dealing with these scenarios needs to be worked out, as Labor is not confident that the bills cover this as they currently stand. As the Senate is best placed to ensure that the bills deliver on what the government hopes to achieve, Labor will refer the bills to committee to assess these valid issues raised by the higher education and TAFE sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, these bills remind us yet again that the government has systematically decimated the skills and training sector over the six years that they have been in charge. Much like the ABC bill currently before the House, the government is simply tinkering about the edges when there are real issues that need to be addressed. Rather than delivering the funding and reform required by the higher education sector in Australia, and especially the TAFE system, we see these inconsequential changes—good, but not good enough. The government continues to distract from the bigger issues at stake with amendments here and there. These bills, while important, are an example of this government's lack of agenda and lack of ambition for Australia and its people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government speaks ad nauseam about skills, jobs and jobs growth, and yet they decimate the very system that will empower Australians to get jobs. The Liberals have slashed $3 billion from TAFE and training. That $3 billion in cuts means Australia now faces a crisis in skills and vocational training. There's a national shortage of tradies. Despite this, Scott Morrison has cut funding to TAFE and training. He's let apprentice and trainee numbers fall off a cliff, and now he's trying to blame young people for not choosing a trade. Under the Liberals, there are 150,000 fewer apprentices and trainees, and a shortage of workers in critical services including plumbing, carpentry, hairdressing and motor mechanics. The number of Australians doing an apprenticeship or traineeship is lower today than it was a decade ago. There are more people dropping out of apprenticeships and traineeships than finishing them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Scott Morrison doesn't care about the young people aspiring to be tradespeople who aren't able to get an apprenticeship, surely he can stand up for his quiet Australians who want their house fixed up, their toilet unblocked, their car serviced or their hair done. In Scott Morrison's economy, there's nearly a 10 per cent increase in the number of occupations facing skills shortages. The Australian Industry Group says 75 per cent of businesses surveyed are struggling to find the qualified workers they need. However, while businesses are crying out for more trained staff, there are about 1.9 million Australians who are unemployed or underemployed. We should be training Australians to do the jobs our businesses need qualified workers for, but how can we when our training providers are threadbare and turning away students?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just a problem with the TAFE system. With funding attached to students, the Liberals capped the number of places at our universities. In doing so, they have cut funding to universities and cut the dreams of Australian students and future employees into pieces. Since the election of the government in 2013, universities and students have been under constant attack with cuts, attempts at fee deregulation, policy chaos and uncertainty. Our universities should be focusing on doing the best research and providing the best training and learning. Instead, they have been fighting governments for decades to retain the funding that they have. Again, the government goes on and on about building the Australian economy. Guess what—research and education does just this. It contributes significantly to the Australian economy through innovation and through the provision of education services to a large cohort of international students, in addition to the economic benefits of educating Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But guess what—Australia is but one player in the international education market. As the government forces down the quality of our institutions cut by cut by cut, the international students will go elsewhere—to the UK or the US, or even stay at home—because the quality of our institutions will no longer be considered reputable enough or value for money. You only have to look at the global university rankings to see the international universities rocketing up the charts as Australian institutions struggle to hold onto their positions. The government will tell you that university funding has increased, but a closer look at the data shows it isn't true. According to Universities Australia, most of the increase to university funding is due to HELP loans, and 80 per cent of these loans will be paid back by students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the growth in funding, Australian government total higher education spending as a percentage of GDP only increased from 0.9 per cent in 1989 to one per cent in 2017. Excluding HELP loans, higher education grants for teaching, learning and research have declined from 0.7 per cent in 1989 to 0.6 per cent in 2017. It is a damning reality that this government has cut funding to the tertiary sector. Australia's investment in tertiary education funding is below the international average. Australia's public investment in tertiary institutions as a share of GDP is amongst the lowest in the OECD—ranked 24 out of 34 countries. Australia's public investment was only 0.77 per cent of GDP in 2015 compared to 0.98 per cent of GDP for average OECD countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">International student enrolments have more than doubled since 2001. This represents an average annual growth rate of 5.5 per cent over that period. In 2017, 27 per cent of students enrolled in Australian universities were from overseas, compared to 19 per cent in 2001. Australia has 6.6 per cent of the world's international students studying at the VET, or higher, education level. International education is Australia's third-largest export and the largest services export industry, generating $35.8 billion in export income in 2018. This is an incredible industry for Australia. We should be very proud of our universities and of our TAFEs. They are the envy of the world. But it is clear from these stats that the government is using the international education system here in this country as an excuse to halt funding to the sector. But their actions put the golden goose at risk. If we don't invest in the tertiary education system we will lose it, and our international customers will go elsewhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2017 MYEFO decision to cut $2.2 billion from universities included the recapping of undergraduate places, and the changes to the Higher Education Loan Program were reckless and unfair. Two hundred thousand students will miss out on the opportunity of a university place over the decade, due to the government's cuts and the capping of places. How do we become the high-skilled economy of the future that Australia should be, without giving 200,000 of our citizens the ability to become a member of the workforce of the future?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the demonisation of the poor spreads to every area of policymaking under the Liberals, including higher education. The Liberals have already forced students to start paying off HELP debts when they earn as little as $45,000, which is only $9,000 more than the minimum wage. On this side, we know that debt is a barrier to study, particularly for students from low-income families, so our higher education loan scheme needs to be as well-targeted and fair as possible in order to ensure people don't choose to forgo education because of the loan that they will be taking on to do their study. We want to see greater participation in higher education in Australia. Labor knows that when you lock someone out of education you are locking them out of a job, out of the chance to get ahead and out of the opportunity to create a good life for themselves and for their family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals' decision to recap undergraduate places is devastating participation rates in higher education. Two hundred thousand students won't get the opportunity of a higher education. It's simply not fair that students in more privileged areas, like the North Shore of Sydney, are five times more likely to go to uni than students in areas like the Moreton Bay region of Queensland. We want to change that. Labor wants to give the opportunity of a tertiary education to every student who has the ability and who is prepared to work hard. In contrast, the Liberals want to slam shut the door to university to more than 200,000 Australians. Unlike the Liberals and Nationals, we believe that education funding is an investment in our nation's future prosperity, not a cost burden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A government without a plan for education and training has no plan for Australia's future. So I call on the government to do more than just tinker around the edges of education policy reform. I call on them to utilise the opportunities afforded by an increasing international student market to build a tertiary education system, both universities and TAFEs, that is truly world-leading. Yes, these bills will help students, but the government should be doing more. We are a wealthy nation. We have an incredible human potential. Let's go and harness it so its full potential will build prosperity for all Australians to go through TAFE or university. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  Before I start, I just want to commend the member for Canberra. Under incredible circumstances, with her voice going, it showed a real commitment to education. I'm very, very proud of you, member for Canberra. I, with a healthy voice, rise to speak on the Education Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2019, the VET Student Loans (VSL Tuition Protection Levy) Bill 2019 and the Higher Education Support (HELP Tuition Protection Levy) Bill 2019, as well as the amendment moved by my good friend the member for Cooper. The object of these bills is to protect students with VET student loans and non-university higher education FEE-HELP loans from provider or course closure by identifying alternative providers to allow students to continue their study or offering a refund of tuition fees if there are no replacement providers. The approach taken by these bills is similar to the Tuition Protection Service established to protect overseas students if a higher education or vocational education training provider in Australia is unable to fully deliver their course due to course or provider closure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor won't oppose these bills. In fact, we welcome the practical effect of them, which is to create simpler arrangements for students and processes for decision-making, student placement and VSL or HELP loan re-crediting. This will give students confidence that they will not be left in debt and without a qualification if their training facility fails before they have finished their course, which, sadly, does happen. We've seen it too often. I've seen it in a former life, working for a union. The usual story, too often, is that they're dodgy providers that are overloaded with students and are hoping to make a quick profit. They rent a room for six months and put up a whiteboard, and they don't invest in capital infrastructure, teaching staff or decent wages. Then what happens? They go belly-up, leaving the students out of pocket and without the qualifications they need to get a job. It leaves students damaged, poorer and wary of learning, and that's not a good outcome for society, obviously—not a good combination. My big question, obviously, is: why has it taken the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government so long to act to protect these students? I do not know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So who will these bills protect? They will protect students who use student loans to pay for vocational education and training and higher education courses at public and private providers, including TAFEs. They do not protect students studying at public universities, as they are exempt from newer arrangements entirely. Those students are already protected under existing arrangements to manage course closures. There is, one would hope, a low risk of default amongst Australia's wonderful universities. It will not protect students who pay up-front fees. For students under current arrangements, those accessing state funding or subsidies are referred to their state or territory department of education. Those who have paid more than $1,500 are asked to contact ITECA, and those who paid less than $1,500 are referred to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. There has been a concern raised by stakeholders regarding the exclusion of fee-paying students. The bills impose participation on non-exempt providers in a tuition protection scheme and payment of an associated levy as a condition of continuing approval as a provider via VSL or FEE-HELP. For domestic students who pay up-front fees, the provider is not compelled to participate in the tuition protection scheme. There are also some concerns that providers will pass on levies to students and that TAFEs will be forced to take on poorly trained students in the event of a course closure. It is because of these concerns that Labor supports referring the bills to committee to ensure these issues are addressed and fully considered.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Labor does not oppose the bills, we recognise that it is not the genuine reform that this sector actually needs. We have the Morrison government in their seventh year. I know it seems longer, as the brute from Bronte lurches us back towards the cave, but so far what have they done? They've trashed the quality of Australia's world-class higher education and vocation system. There is a national shortage of tradies in critical services, including plumbing, carpentry, hairdressing and motor mechanics, and that's a crisis that won't be solved any time soon. There are 150,000 fewer apprentices and trainees, and the Morrison government has ripped $3 billion from TAFE and training. On top of the $3 billion ripped from them, TAFE, training and apprenticeship programs have been short-changed by almost $1 billion. It's no wonder the number of Australians doing an apprenticeship or traineeship is lower today than it was a decade ago even though the Australian population has surged in that time. More people are dropping out of apprenticeships and traineeships than are actually finishing them—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2013, universities and students have been under constant attack with cuts, attempts at fee deregulation, policy chaos and uncertainty. The 2017 MYEFO decision to cut $2.2 billion from universities and recap undergraduate places and the changes to HELP loans were reckless and unfair. Two hundred thousand students will miss out on a university place over the decade. And we know that the coalition government would have introduced $100,000 university degrees in this country if they had their way. Students are now forced to pay off their HELP debts when they earn as little as $45,000—only $9,000 more than the minimum wage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to see greater participation in higher education in Australia. By locking Australians out of education, the Liberals are locking Australians out of good jobs. By presiding over a skills crisis, the coalition is holding Australian business back. Australians deserve world-class TAFEs and universities, and the Liberals have gutted both. The Liberals have slammed the university door on 200,000 young Australians. Shame on them! Every young school leaver should have a choice about their future based on their ability, not their postcode or their parents' credit card. It's just not fair that a student in the North Shore of Sydney is five times more likely to go to university than a student in the Moreton Bay Region of Queensland. Funding education is an investment in our nation's future prosperity, not a cost burden. A government without a plan for education and training has no plan for Australia's future, and, if it's not planning for the future, why is this government here at all?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="276714" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  I also rise to speak on the Education Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection And Other Measures) Bill 2019, the VET Student Loans (VSL Tuition Protection Levy) Bill 2019 and the Higher Education Support (HELP Tuition Protection Levy) Bill 2019. The bills give effect to a mid-year economic and fiscal outlook 2018-19 announcement that long-term arrangements for tuition assurance would be introduced. And the bills are in response to a review in January 2018 of the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011 that cited a range of concerns from students about the sector-led tuition assurance arrangements. As noted by our shadow minister, the member for Cooper, Labor won't oppose these bills. We welcome the practical effect, which is to create simpler arrangements for students and processes for decision-making, student placement, and VSL and HELP recrediting. During my time as an organiser for Professionals Australia and working alongside the ETU and AMWU, I witnessed firsthand the loss of confidence in the VET sector, and the students should not be the ones left carry the can. Students should be protected and assisted in the case of provider or course closure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As noted in the bills digest, the bills attempt to address the question of how best to protect students who use student loans to pay for vocational education and training and higher education courses at public and private providers, including TAFEs, in cases of provider or course closure. The bills propose to replace sector-managed tuition assurance arrangements with two new tuition protection schemes—one for each sector—modelled on the existing Australian Government Tuition Protection Service, which has been in place for overseas students since 2012. Each new scheme will be responsible for managing the process of determining if there are replacement courses for affected students and, in cases where there are not, making recommendations about recrediting the student's VET student loan or Higher Education Loan Program borrowings related to the course. Each new scheme will be managed through a special account which will be sector funded by a levy made up of three components: an administrative fee component, a risk rated premium component and a tuition protection component.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why are we here? Why is the House considering these bills? This package of bills is part of ongoing efforts to address the impact of the program that preceded VSL, VET FEE-HELP, which ran from 2008 to 2016 as part of HELP. VET FEE-HELP has ultimately become known for enabling increases in course fees and unrecoverable student debt, and that is putting it mildly. These bills attempt to clean up the ongoing mess of this government and their carriage of VET-FEE Help. No-one on this side of the chamber will forget the millions in debt lost and the dodgy providers allowed to operate on this government's watch.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So who is covered and who is not covered by these bills? The bills cover students who use student loans to pay for vocational education and training and higher education courses at public and private providers, including TAFEs. Australian public universities will be exempt from the new arrangements entirely, as they already have appropriate arrangements in place to manage course closures and have a low risk of default. Students who pay up-front fees are not covered by the proposed new tuition protection schemes. Instead, under current arrangements: those accessing state funding or subsidies are referred to their state or territory department of education, those who have paid more than $1,500 are asked to contact the Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia, and those who paid less than $1,500 are referred to the ACCC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As noted before, one of our major concerns is that these bills do not cover all students, and of particular concern is the lack of coverage for full-fee paying students. It is not surprising that key stakeholders also have concerns. Independent Higher Education Australia have raised significant concerns around this point. They warn this may leave a cohort of students at risk of having no tuition protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ITECA also have concerns around providers passing the cost of the levy onto students and, broadly, the growing trend of cost recovery in the higher education and vocational training sector. TAFE Directors Australia have concerns around the requirement to take on poorly trained students in the event of course closures. Given these concerns, we will work with the Senate to refer these bills to committee to ensure that these concerns are properly addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, let's be honest, this sector needs more than tweaks. We know that we need genuine reform in this sector. A sector that so many on this side of the chamber are passionate about is almost at crisis point. Those opposite talk about caring about trades and about workers' skills. They talk about training the workforce of tomorrow. But like so much else to do with this government, it's all marketing. It's all tip and no rest of the iceberg. It's all about the line and not about the reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at some recent data: completion rates for apprentices and trainees who commenced training in 2014 have decreased to 56.7 per cent; 22,000 fewer students have enrolled in government-funded vocational education and training compared to 2017, representing an almost two per cent drop in student numbers; and, in the past six years, government-funded full-year training equivalents have decreased by 30 per cent. We have members opposite who have ticked off the cutting of more than $3 billion in funding in this sector. They have presided over a drop of 150,000 apprentices, the closing of TAFE campuses and allowing dodgy for-profit providers to gouge the system. The government have had six years to turn this around and have failed to take action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you can believe it, ashamedly, the number of Australians doing an apprenticeship or traineeship is lower today than it was a decade ago, despite the population growth. There are more people dropping out of apprenticeships and traineeships than finishing them. There will be nearly a 10 per cent increase in the number of occupations facing skills shortages if this continues. The Australian Industry Group—that well-known radical organisation!—says 75 per cent of businesses surveyed are struggling to find the qualified workers they need. We have also seen all too often dodgy providers overload with students for a quick profit and then go belly-up, leaving those students out of pocket and without the qualifications they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this week, estimates showed that this is getting worse. We saw reported in the media today that the Morrison government fell almost $1 billion short of budgeted spending on vocational training programs over the last five years, a gap that has persisted despite the skills crisis facing Australia. The level of incompetence by this government is pretty staggering. We have a $919 million underspend in vocational training, and it took estimates to reveal it. The Liberal Morrison government has short-changed and starved the training sector, even as Australia faces an ongoing skills shortage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, Labor has been saying that our TAFEs are in disrepair and apprentice and trainee numbers have fallen off a cliff, and we have more proof this week with this underspend. If the government doesn't do something serious to fix the skills crisis they have created, we could be looking at the extinction of the Australian tradie. These funds were meant to go to programs such as apprenticeship incentives, scholarships, migrant English support and trade loans. By any measure, it is fail, and it is on the watch of those opposite—on the watch of the government's minister for skills and the watch of this Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the Nationals are no better. I think we can safely conclude that the Liberals and their weak National cousins—the Liberals in moleskins—have severely damaged our vocational education system. You would think the Nationals would get it. I'm sure they try. They're always trying, those Nationals, but young people in regional areas are keen to stay near home and family and to study at regional TAFEs, benefiting greatly from skills that give them a start in life. Those regional TAFEs provide ongoing employment for locals and inject money that is sorely needed now into those local economies. They're often the heart of the town, a hub for the community to gather and engage. In the electorates of Page or Maranoa, we see youth unemployment as high as 25 per cent. That is one in four young people looking for work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need more regional VET investment not less. We need a proper reform plan for regional TAFEs. But, as we know all too well, this is a government without a plan. The Liberals and Nationals have trashed the quality of Australia's world-class higher education system and vocational system. This is not just about statistics and facts; this abject failing of the government has a real effect on people's lives. This government is not a new government, despite the fact that it likes to try to pin the blame for every policy failure on the last Labor government. This third-term government simply refuses to deliver a genuine reform package that overhauls the higher education and VET sectors—a plan that properly funds vocational training providers and universities to deliver the services that their students need and employers are crying out for. Employers are crying out for more trained staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are about 1.9 million Australians who are unemployed or underemployed. There's a national shortage of tradies. The Prime Minister has cut funding to TAFE and training and he's let apprentice and trainee numbers fall off a cliff. His latest marketing tactic is to hire a celebrity chippie and make the kids feel guilty for not choosing a trade. That is not going to be a fix. I'm sure Scott Cam is a good bloke, and he may even support a unionised workforce, collectively bargaining for decent conditions from the beginning of careers to the end of careers. But, if this government wants to fix the skills crisis it has created, it should stop hiring celebrities and start funding TAFE and apprentices.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the government's approach to VET is not different to the approach of this government more broadly. As I said earlier, this government has no plan for our country. It has no plan to deal with wage stagnation and rising prices. The cost of essentials across Australia is skyrocketing; electricity prices are increasing; and child care has become unaffordable under this government. Australians right across this country are worried about the economy, but the Prime Minister and his government are pretending that there is no problem. We recently had the lowest rate of growth since the GFC, and per capita GDP is flat-lining. It is time for this government to wake up and produce a genuine plan to get the economy moving again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to VET this government must undertake immediate and urgent reform. The government must put TAFE back at the centre of the sector, tackle the failures of privatisation and fund the sector properly. As others who have spoken in this debate have said—and which I fully endorse—with youth unemployment stuck at more than double the national average, young people need a decent skills sector that leads them to secure work. Australians and the businesses that employ them deserve excellent TAFEs and universities, whatever region you live in across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the government, Labor gets it. Unlike those who sit opposite us, we value the role of an appropriately funded VET sector for the training, skills and apprenticeships they provide to so many Australians. We on this side know that debt is a barrier to study, particularly for students from low-income families. We want to see greater participation in higher education in Australia. Labor knows that, when you lock someone out of education, you are effectively locking them out of a job, out of the chance to get ahead and provide for themselves and their families. Labor wants to give every student who has the ability and is prepared to work hard the life opportunities that come from a world-class VET and university sector. We believe that funding education is an investment in our nation's future prosperity, not a burden.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MURPHY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  I rise to speak on the Education Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2019, the VET Student Loans (VSL Tuition Protection Levy) Bill 2019 and the Higher Education Support (HELP Tuition Protection Levy) Bill 2019 as a Labor member of the federal parliament who believes in and understands the importance of education and vocational skills and training for the future of young people. I am also standing here today as a representative of a community which proudly boasts both Chisholm TAFE and the Monash University Peninsula Campus. In Dunkley, we understand how important it is for our young people to have educational opportunities, particularly educational opportunities in the public sector. Chisholm TAFE is an institution that Frankston residents, Dunkley residents and people from the Mornington Peninsula are rightly very proud of, because it has given young people opportunities that they otherwise would never have imagined that they could have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud to be married to someone who is a graduate of what is now Chisholm Institute but was Frankston TAFE. My own husband's story is one of not finishing high school, of going out and working, and then returning and doing his VCAE at Frankston TAFE. If it hadn't been for that publicly funded institution that was there for him, he would not have been able to go on to the career that he has had—which includes, now, being a professor at Monash University, which brings, possibly, the educational cycle full circle. His story is not a unique story in my community, because of Chisholm TAFE. But it's been a hard struggle to keep that institution alive and functioning and where it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are very lucky that, under the current state Labor government, Chisholm TAFE has had a massive investment. We've just opened phase 1 of a redevelopment. Our institution is now a magnificent modern building, but, more importantly, it's a magnificent modern site for our young people—and the older people in our community—to go and access training and skills for the jobs now and the jobs of the future. If it weren't for the state Labor government, that wouldn't be the case, because not one single cent—not one single cent—of federal funding has gone towards that redevelopment. The state Labor government has contributed $46.9 million to the $83.4 million project and will put in another $67.6 million for stage 2. And what have we got from the current Liberal federal government? Nothing. The Chisholm TAFE now boasts a state-of-the-art health community centre, early childhood education and hair, beauty and wellness facilities, innovative new student spaces and classrooms, and redeveloped trade facilities, including a purpose-built, flexible, integrated design centre. We are so proud of what we have at our TAFE. But, as I said, it has required the community to back it and has required the state Labor government to back it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been to that TAFE countless times in the last 12 months, and I've visited, many times, the young women who are doing a VCAL program there—young women who are teenage mothers, who have not been able to complete their education and are determined to get the education that they need for a brighter future. They go to the Chisholm TAFE facility and they bring their children, and they are seeking an education. They are the people who we should be backing. They are the people who require a federal government that will properly invest in our TAFE system. They are the people who suffer when we have a federal government that underspends in our TAFE and our vocational education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other people in my community that I'm very concerned will suffer from this government's underspend on and ignoring of the TAFE system, particularly in my community, are the young men who need to get the trade and manufacturing skills—and, mind you, the young women who need the same, because, I'm very pleased to see, their involvement in the trade training at Chisholm TAFE is growing—for the jobs of the future, in smart manufacturing, in high-tech manufacturing. That's what my TAFE and my community want to work with local industries on: to teach our young people so that they can work in the jobs of the future. They need a federal government that will back them in, to be able to achieve it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got an economy at the moment that is crying out for skilled workers. Everyone in this place knows that that is the case. We've had surveys that have said to us that three-quarters of employers say that they cannot find the skilled workers they need. I've had local manufacturing businesses tell me that they can't find apprentice plumbers and local mechanics tell me that they can't find apprentice mechanics. That's just not good enough. We need to do better for our young people. We have two million Australians who don't have a job or want more hours of work and we have a skills shortage across the economy in so many areas: plumbers, electricians, carpenters, hairdressers, pastry chefs. We have a skills crisis. We have a desperate need for skilled workers yet we have Australians who want more work. We have people in my community, such as young mothers, young men, older women wanting to go back to work and older men looking to retrain, who want to be able to get the education and the skills and vocational training they need. But they can't do it, because they don't have a federal government that is backing in the sector that would provide it for them. We have a government that has underspent the TAFE and training budget. It's just not good enough—$200 million last year, and over the last few years up to $919 million. The federal government has close to a $1 billion underspend in the crucial education and training sector, which is important for now and into the future. $3 billion worth of cuts. I stand here more in sorrow than in anger. Like many people in my community, I am angry, but I am sad that we have a federal government that won't back in my community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is not opposing these bills today. We are welcoming the practical effect, which is creating a simpler arrangement for students and for the processes of decision making, student placement, and VSL and HELP re-crediting. We understand that students should be protected and assisted in the case of provider or course closure. This package of bills is part of an ongoing effort to address the impact of the VET FEE-HELP program, which saw increases in course fees and unrecoverable student debt. There are good outcomes from this legislation, but stakeholders have raised concerns about the exclusion of fee-paying students, the cost of the levy being passed on to students, and for TAFEs to take on poorly trained students in the event of a course closure, which is why we in Labor, although supporting these bills today, also want them to go to a committee to ensure that the issues are addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I join with my fellow Labor members in this place to say that this sector just can't be tweaked at the edges. We need a proper reform package. We will continue to advocate on behalf of our communities for that reform package. The reforms of the Andrews Labor government—the free TAFE courses—have made an amazing difference for people in my community who otherwise would not have been able to go to TAFE and could not afford to be part of it. Fully 36,000 students have started free TAFE courses in Victoria in the nine months to the end of September. The Chisholm Institute has played a major part in that growth, with more than 6,000 students starting free TAFE courses. I went to a graduation ceremony recently at Chisholm TAFE, and it was joyous. The looks on the faces of the people who were graduating—young and old and from many places across the globe, across our state, and from Frankston—was pride. Their families were there proudly supporting them. That's what I want for every young person in my community and every young person in Australia who wants to get vocational qualifications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I join with my Labor colleagues who point out that appointing an ambassador for trades is no replacement for reforming a sector to train young Australians, and older Australians who want to be retrained, to get trades. We need a government that will properly fund and invest in TAFE and universities, that won't cut research funding from universities, and that will back in people who want to access education but can't afford it. The people of Dunkley know how important education and vocational training are to a good future. They want a government that understands this in the same way that they do. I give them this promise: they have a federal member who understands it in the way they do and will take every opportunity to stand up and support the public provision of education and training in Dunkley and in the wider Mornington Peninsula region.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  I want to address the House tonight on something that could give rise to a tone of outrage, but I don't want to deliver it that way, and that's because I believe there is a very significant issue at stake in terms of the relevance of this chamber to Australian democracy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all accept and we all know that there will be spin on each side on any agreed set of facts. Whatever's happening, different people will have their perspective on it, and that will form the nature of debate; that's why we have different political views. In the last few years, quite distinctly in the last few months and even in the last couple of days, I am seeing more and more an argument about not how you view the facts but whether or not facts are in fact true—where something which is demonstrably true is just denied. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It struck me yesterday when the Minister for Home Affairs gave an entirely prepared answer to a dixer which was based on the premise that, in 2014, Labor had opposed legislation which we had supported. It was on the record that we had supported it. His office would have known that we had supported it and, when he was preparing the answer, everyone would have realised that the claim that was the basis of the entire prepared answer was untrue. So we followed the normal procedures of the House at the end of question time. Our deputy leader stood up and explained this; it's done. But I don't think for a minute that will change the behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've dealt, in my own portfolios over the years, with claims—from one of the members who is in the House, but not the only one who has repeatedly claimed—that Labor never built a dam. I know as both a former agriculture minister and a former environment minister that I attended the opening of dams built under the Labor government, approved under the government, like the Headquarters Road dam and the Milford Dam. There was the approval that I gave for the expansion of Chaffey Dam, the augmentation of Chaffey; the approval I gave for stage 3 of the Ord; and the approval that we gave to the Millstream Dam expansion, the Duckhole Rivulet Dam, the Glebe Weir expansion, the Hinze Dam upgrade. All of that's true. All of that's on the record. And yet the claim 'Labor never built a dam, Labor never approved a dam' will continue to be made in this House, even though it is demonstrably untrue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to be told by members of the government that they have to pay down Labor's debt, even though the national debt now is more than double what it was when the change of government occurred. So, if the debt belongs to anyone, more than half of it belongs to those opposite. And yet the claim will continue to be made. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to hear people make a claim with respect to emissions—that somehow we are meeting an emissions target which requires emissions to go down, while emissions are going up. Now, I accept that within the House there will be arguments about what those targets will be. There will be some people who will want to argue that there shouldn't be any at all. But the concept that we're having an argument about whether they're going up or down, when the evidence is unarguable that they're going up, troubles me about what the parliament then becomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most extraordinary examples was at the National Press Club, during the election campaign, when the Prime Minister was asked about a report that had come out that day with respect to extinctions. His response was: 'We've already introduced and passed legislation through the Senate actually dealing with that very issue, in the last week of the parliament.' No such legislation existed. Nothing went through in the last week of the parliament relating to extinctions. There was something about chemical testing on rabbits—not exactly about to be extinct, not exactly a native species.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is simply what I want to remind the House about. In terms of the game of politics, people might think, 'I got away with it; I played the game.' Outside of this chamber, people live in the world of facts. If their wages aren't moving, false claims here won't change the fact that their wages aren't moving. If the climate is changing, denial in here won't alter the fact that the climate is changing. I simply remind all members that, if we are not starting with agreed and obvious facts, the relevance of this chamber only declines.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="E5D" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  I'd like to start with one fact: when I returned to New England, Chaffey Dam wasn't built. It wasn't built because they couldn't get the environmental approvals through because of, among other things, the Booroolong frog, for which they needed environmental offsets. This is where the Labor Party live. They live in this mystery world where they talk about building Chaffey Dam. That was not correct. It was not true. It didn't happen. It wasn't there. We built it. We built it because we forced through the approvals to make sure that happened, and we put more money in so it could happen. After we attained government, it was built, and that is a fact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about something pressing: the drought. The drought in regional areas occupies most of the time of my colleagues in the National Party because it is so seminal. I want to clearly note that, when we say that if a person has not made a profit in the last 10 years they should consider what they do, that does not mean that they should leave the land; it means that they should consider how they can earn extra money—whether they go to a trade, whether they become a cartage operator, or whether they go back to other jobs. I refer this to the people I know—go back to shearing, go back to driving a truck, start a small business. They have to look at other ways to bring in an income, because they can't just live in perpetual poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I want to tell the Australian people in the regional areas tonight is that we are working on drought in the National Party. We have been. We absolutely put this at the forefront of our view. The Nationals have a developed policy to make sure that we deal with this. We believe that a drought committee should be set up in each drought shire affected. It would include such people as the local mayor; a local community leader, such as the president of Rotary; the rural financial counsellor that covers the district; the local federal member and the local state member and/or their appointed representatives; a local business leader, such as a local stock and station agent, with a clear understanding of the area in drought; and a representative of a local charity that has so much to do with trying to manage the people who are dealing with drought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee would be given access to a drought fund to be dispersed for any issue that has a clear nexus to the drought requirements of the shire. We say that because the requests that come to us are many and varied, and now we need local knowledge to make the contract between the many and varied requests and the local knowledge that would be apparent in a local committee. The fund would be furbished with $10 million per shire—a fifty-fifty contribution from the state and the federal government, so the state understands their part of this responsibility. The fund only becomes active when both have contributed to that fund, to keep the political pressure on them. Just because a shire would be allocated $10 million doesn't mean it would spend $10 million; it would spend as much as required, knowing that the stewardship of that respected committee has oversight of that money. The federal member or state member would have a right of veto, so if some untoward proposal came forward, they would have the capacity to say, 'No, we're not going to accept that.' If the committee needed to go in camera to deal with the personal issues of someone, it could, so that it has the capacity to hear people who are privy to the private details of someone who is under stress or under duress and be able to help them directly. This would be able to deal with a whole myriad of issues, like fodder, AQIS fees, and the people out in the western districts where there are no high schools—making sure those kids don't come back from boarding school, because if they come back from boarding school, that's the end of their education. They're not going to go back to working like a man—or as a girl—on the place and then go back to boarding school; their life has changed. We would make sure that if further funds are required down the track, we would deal with this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know how politics works; I've been in it for long enough. We keep on thinking—and colleagues have also said this to me—that if we just do enough to catch up, we're there. Well, the drought is going on, and we have to now reach ahead of it. We have to reach ahead of it or be dragged later on down the track. My message to the Australian people tonight is that the National Party does have their shoulder to the wheel on this issue. We are driving agendas. We are making sure that we are looking after the people, our core constituencies. We are proud of the fact that we do build dams. We've announced Dungowan Dam and Upper Mole River Dam, and we built Chaffey Dam. We are building dams in Tasmania—we are actually doing that. We would build Rookwood Weir if a state Labor government weren't so attached to the green movement that they would never, ever get out of bed to help regional people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="8GH" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Earlier this month I visited the South Australian Aboriginal community of Scotdesco, approximately 100 kilometres west of Ceduna. I visited Scotdesco as part of my visit to remote Indigenous communities around Central Australia, from the Pilbara in Western Australia to Ceduna in South Australia to Kata Tjuta in the Northern Territory. I had the opportunity to meet the community's chief executive officer, Robert Larking. Robert informed me about the severe water emergency currently confronting the community. Due to its location, Scotdesco is not connected to the main water network. It depends on water from the local catchment. It has received minimal rainfall over the winter period. During this time it has relied on a sheeted water catchment and bladder storage to secure its water supply. I saw the water catchment and bladder storage for myself. Let me tell you that it was absolutely shocking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can understand why the community is so anxious about the situation. The water west scheme provides for subsidised delivery of tanker water within the Ceduna region. A semi-truckload of water can be delivered within the area for $280. However, as Scotdesco is located just 10 kilometres outside this prescribed area, that very same semi-truckload of water will cost the community $1,400, almost five times what it costs with the subsidy. This is an absurd and unacceptable set of circumstances. This community cannot be expected to fork out thousands of dollars a pop for the very same water the rest of us take for granted. The Scotdesco community is home to about 50 residents, a dozen of them children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we can all appreciate but take for granted as well, water is essential to so many aspects of daily life, from hydration to cooking and cleaning, washing clothes and taking showers. This water crisis presents serious real-life consequences for the local community. Access to clean water was a prevalent issue throughout my visits to remote communities in Central Australia. I have seen how this issue has contributed to and compounded other health related issues. I have seen how the lack of clean water has pushed many to rely on soft drinks and sugary drinks for hydration. I have learned about how the lack of clean water inhibits the provision of healthcare and health services and procedures such as administering dialysis machines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The water supply in the Scotdesco community is now reaching severe emergency levels. This is unsustainable and unacceptable, and a permanent solution needs to be found. If weather forecasts are correct, South Australia is in for a long hot summer. These conditions will be difficult to live through in a capital or major city, in particular during this time of drought; I can only imagine how difficult it would be for a remote community such as Scotdesco. As shadow minister for Indigenous Australians I've joined with the South Australian shadow minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Kyam Maher. Together we have called on the South Australian Premier and his government to act now on this issue. We have also drawn the attention of the Prime Minister and the federal Minister for Indigenous Affairs to this unfolding water emergency. We urge the governments to urgently intervene and develop a reasonable solution to improve the Scotdesco community's water security situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Scotdesco have been incredibly diligent and waterwise. They have played their part. It is now time for the South Australian and Commonwealth governments to show some leadership and play their part. I commend the Scotdesco community CEO, Robert Larking, for his tireless advocacy on this issue. I also commend the South Australian opposition for standing with Robert and the Scotdesco community. This should be straightforward. I sincerely urge the South Australian government and the Australian federal government to have a look at the desperate situation that the people of Scotdesco find themselves in. As I said, this community is not connected to any main water network; it relies on a dam which is covered by a bladder. As I said, I went and had a look at the water supply there. It is desperately low, and this community is about to run out of water.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I want to take this opportunity to address a number of different pieces of legislation that have been going through the parliament lately or are about to. The first one I want to talk to is the cashless welfare card. There have been about four trial sites across the country. The latest trial site was in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. It covered people aged between 18 and 35 on Newstart, youth allowance or parenting payments. They would get a debit card and 80 per cent of their Newstart allowance could be used with that card to buy normal groceries and normal things that they need, and 20 per cent would go into their bank account. This is certainly not necessarily the majority, but some people who are on Newstart or some of those allowances have alcohol or drug or gambling addictions. What this is about is trying to help those people and especially those families to break that cycle they are in. A delegation from one of the more isolated communities that was one of the first trial sites came to this House. I spoke to some of the mothers and grandmothers involved, who said this trial changed their lives and their children's lives overnight. I commend the government. I commend the fact that we're doing this trial. The statistics on these trials show that hospital presentations are down, school attendance is up. Everything you want to see go up is going up and everything you want to see go down is going down in the trial sites. I commend the government for extending the trials of that program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recently announced the trial sites for drug testing new Newstart recipients. The trial sites are in Logan in Queensland, Canterbury-Bankstown in New South Wales and Mandurah in Western Australia. What is this about? There will be some random drug testing of people who are applying to go onto Newstart. This is not unusual. I mean, there are millions of Australian people in the workforce who undergo drug testing for the different jobs that they are in, so this isn't specifically peculiar to Newstart. Why are we doing this? Obviously some people on Newstart are just down on their luck but, statistically, people on Newstart do tend to have more drug or alcohol dependency than people who aren't on Newstart. So, especially for young people, what we do not want is to give up on people. If they test twice to having drugs or alcohol, they will get assistance. They will get rehabilitation services. Again, it's a trial. What we want to do is see how this runs out, see how the trial works and, if the statistics are good, then obviously we would look to expand this. But again, it is a wonderful initiative to try and help people who are down on their luck and who may also have an addiction that we could help them with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing I wanted to talk about tonight is I was quite surprised when I heard a statistic recently that 28 per cent of child sex offenders convicted in 2018 did not spend one day in jail. I don't think you'd find many Australians who would say that that is okay. The government has introduced mandatory jail time for child sex offenders. Police received almost 18,000 reports of child exploitation involving Australian children or Australian child sex offenders just last year. A jail term is now the starting point for child sex offenders. It won't matter how good their lawyer is, a prison cell will be waiting for them if they are convicted, and so it should be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that we were speaking about earlier this week in this chamber was the benefits of the free trade agreements. I'd especially like to highlight the free trade agreement that we've negotiated with Indonesia. I still sometimes get surprised when I just think about the population of Indonesia, our closest neighbour. We in Australia have a population of, let's say, 25 million. Indonesia has a population 10 times that, of close to 270 million people. Our closest neighbour has 10 times the population of Australia. They have one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. I'm excited about this free trade agreement for a number of reasons, not least of which is my own local economy. I come from an area that has blueberries, macadamias, beef, dairy, fishing, forestry, and a lot of other products. I commend the government in negotiating this agreement and look forward to it boosting not just Australia's economy but also my local economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="278522" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Tonight, in my adjournment speech I'm going to cover two different topics. The first topic I want to talk about in this place is the growing crisis in retail and small business in this country. What we have at the moment is a number of small businesses in retail at crossroads in this country. The internet is changing the way in which we're buying things and fewer and fewer people are shopping retail, and it's having an effect. In my electorate of Macnamara, we have some of the most outstanding small-business and retail strips in the entire country. We have Acland Street in St Kilda, where my office is located. We have Fitzroy Street, Bay Street in Port Melbourne, Middle Park, Albert Park, amazing cafes and shops in Elwood, Carlisle Street in East St Kilda, and Caulfield. We have amazing shopping strips. But, more and more, we're seeing vacant stores. More and more, we're seeing high streets leaving their old charm and being taken up by the only businesses that can afford the rent, which is large international companies. It's having an effect, yet we don't have a plan to support these businesses, we don't have a plan for small businesses in this country, and we don't have a plan, from this government, to help the ongoing retail crisis. If we don't see the government actually doing something to tackle energy prices, if we don't see the government actually doing something to ensure that vacant properties don't just sit there, if we don't see things that are going to support small businesses and traders, it's going to get worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election, I went with the member for Rankin to speak to many traders in my electorate. We heard from them that the cost of energy is a massive issue and the cost of rent is a massive issue, and, quite frankly, the government doesn't have a plan to support small businesses. Retailers are doing it tough. Since the election, I've been meeting with many of the traders associations and, more and more, we are hearing that they are doing it tough with the cost of rent, and the cost of doing business is hard. Because the nature of business is changing, Australian small businesses, Australian retailers, are doing it really hard. So it would be good to see the government with a plan. I'm not going to hold my breath, but we will continue to advocate and support our small businesses on this side of the chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I want to talk about tonight is a matter of increasing importance: the growing tide of white supremacy. I remember that, when I was advocating for the visa to be cancelled of the British conspiracy theorist, David Icke—a visa which had been granted by the minister for immigration earlier this year—the amount of vile hate I received was pretty overwhelming. It was pretty confronting. Thankfully, it was something that you could just put aside and know that you're doing the right thing. In fact, every piece of bland hate mail almost reaffirms that we're doing the right thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to a local in my electorate, Dr Dvir Abramovich, of the Anti-Defamation Commission, who joined me a few weeks ago, along with the signatures of 28,000 people, to stand against a white supremacist concert that was planned to be held in Melbourne. Dvir, every single time, calls out racism and bigotry in any form, whether it is anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or some of the really awful and nasty comments we heard from people about young African men, especially last year. Dvir calls it out. He, along with the support of John and Pauline Gandel, who support the Anti-Defamation Commission, do an amazing job. I pay tribute to Dvir tonight. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a few weeks ago, we were reminded of the importance of this when Stephan Balliet, who was radicalised by the Far Right, tried to march into a synagogue in the German city of Halle. Fortunately he wasn't able to get into the synagogue, but he did open fire on the closest person he could find, who was an innocent woman who was coming from the bus stop. He also went into a Turkish kebab store and opened fire. This curse of white supremacy is not going away. We need to stand against it every single time it rears its ugly head. We will not rest, because, every single day, we are not better by having intolerant and racist views heard.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  Tonight I rise to speak on behalf of those who are vulnerable, persecuted and separated from their loved ones. Tonight I speak for Uygur Australians who have family and friends facing systematic persecution and internment in Xinjiang province in the People's Republic of China. But first I want to say a few words about the role of Australian investigative journalism and its importance for a free, democratic society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As this House is aware, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is conducting an inquiry into freedom of the press. As the chair, it would be improper for me to make remarks about committee deliberations or what conclusions we might reach in our report, but I do want to say that we all agree that public interest and investigative journalism is vital to a thriving liberal democracy, particularly when it comes to national security or human rights issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A superb example of good investigative journalism is the July <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> episode 'Tell the world' by ABC reporter Sophie McNeill. The program detailed the plight and suffering of more than one million Muslim minorities who have been rounded up, detained and forcibly indoctrinated by the Chinese communist regime. Australian citizens or permanent residents have been targeted and jailed. Others are trapped under state surveillance, their passports seized. I was deeply moved by those who courageously shared their story on the program. I was moved by those who have been separated from their loved ones. I think of Sadam Abudusalamu, who is separated from his wife and child—a child he has never met in person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These individual and personal stories helped us understand and humanise the greater tragedy that is unfolding in Xinjiang province, China. I, along with many other Australians, am very troubled by the repressive surveillance state and how the Uygur people are being banned from practicing their religious faith and how they are being oppressively monitored in their homes, in their communities, 24/7. I am very troubled by the way that Uygur culture and identity is being systematically assaulted, deconstructed and scrubbed out by the authorities. I am very troubled by the clear evidence of re-education camps, where one million Uygurs have been forcibly detained and indoctrinated into communists thinking. The ABC, along with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, have managed to identify 28 detention camps using satellite imagery. Most of those detained have never committed a crime. I could go on. It was a heartbreaking episode that we all needed to watch and absorb. I congratulate the ABC for running it and for the work that went into it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, I met with members of the Australian Uygur community in my parliamentary office. That delegation was led by Nurmuhammad Majid. It was my great honour to host them and hear their personal stories. Every single one of them sitting in my office had family and friends interned or trapped in Xinjiang province. They have shown great courage and perseverance despite the tears, heartache and pain. I made a commitment to them that I would raise their plight in this House, and tonight I fulfil that commitment. I say to them: we might not see resolution soon, but we will continue to work with you and make sure your loved ones are not forgotten.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> episode identified a range of Australian businesses that were sourcing cotton from Xinjiang province, potentially using Uygur forced labour. Cotton On and Target Australia were two of them. Subsequent to the program, both businesses conducted internal reviews of their supply chains and have ceased sourcing cotton from Xinjiang province. I want to note the actions of Cotton On and Target Australia in this House and applaud them for the action that they have taken. Australia is a country that lives by the values of freedom and fairness, and so it is right that we acknowledge when our businesses do the right thing. I thank the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  The NDIS is a good system. It is a system that was proudly pioneered by Labor to support Australians living with a disability. I acknowledge at the outset the critical role that Bill Shorten, our former leader, played in bringing the scheme to life. Unfortunately, under the Liberals we're seeing the NDIS spiral into crisis. Earlier this year the Treasurer propped up the budget at the expense of Australians with disability by ripping $1.6 billion out of the National Disability Insurance Scheme—that is $1.6 billion less for people with disability. While the Treasurer shamelessly short changed the NDIS by $1.6 billion, Australians with disabilities are missing out on the support and care that they need. Waiting times are out of control and applicants are having to wait months to have their plan reviewed or get technical support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most frustrating and offensive things that has happened in the debate about NDIS funding is the claim of those on the other side that the NDIS is a demand-driven scheme and that the reason it has been underspent is that there is not enough demand. There are two Labor MPs sitting behind me, and I know I speak for them when I say that our offices are inundated with people who are trying to get things out of the NDIS but, because of the staffing caps in that organisation, are not able to get the help they need. We want the government to open its eyes and acknowledge that the NDIS is not living up to its promise today. It can do that, but it's not doing it today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak about  some of the constituents who have come to me for help with NDIS issues. One  constituent in Wheelers Hill contacted my office about her son, who requires special foot orthotics to prevent further deterioration and deformity in his lower limbs. Their request of the National Disability Insurance Scheme to secure funding was submitted almost a year ago today. My constituent followed up with them many times and finally came to my office for help. The matter was then resolved within three days. This story, where you have to get your member of parliament involved in the NDIS to get the outcome that you deserve, is happening all over the country. Another constituent, from Mulgrave, had a first NDIS plan for her severely autistic daughter. The whole plan was about the support coordinator, but the funding for the support coordinator wasn't included in the package. My office requested a review, which is going to take three months. All the while, that family is sitting there without the support they need. Another constituent in Mulgrave contacted me about her twin daughters. They both have disabilities and need home modifications. Her request to the NDIA went months and months and months, and even with the advocacy of my office it is taking a further two months to get this claim processed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can do so much better. This scheme has enormous potential to improve the lives of millions of Australians, but I fear that we are going to need a Labor government to make sure it lives up to that promise.</span>

The issues that faced the industry—gate price and severe drought, in that order—continue to threaten the future of dairy farmers in Queensland. The dairy industry continues to be one of Australia's most important agricultural industries. Generating over $13 billion across the whole supply chain, dairy is Australia's third-largest rural industry. It generated $4.3 billion from gate production in 2017-18—a retail value of $6.8 billion—and $3.4 billion worth of products exported. The Australian dairy industry employs approximately 39,000 people. Central Queensland dairy farmers are vital to their local economies and to rural and regional areas of Flynn. In my electorate there are approximately 29 farmers left. There are only 29 farmers left in the whole of Flynn, which is twice the size of Tasmania. It is a small number compared to what used to be in Flynn. There were thousands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a particular dairy farm in Biloela, which is run by third-generation people, they milk 400 cows a day. Their power bill has doubled in the last 10 years and fodder prices have increased, especially due to the drought. They are extraordinarily high because of the drought and the cost of bringing in this product when there is drought across the whole eastern part of Australia. Their concerns are that order needs to be brought back to the industry. There is no order there at the moment—often the processors get more than the farmer gets—so that's why I'm glad my government is taking action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government supports Australian dairy farmers being paid a fair price at the gate for their milk. The Australian dairy industry mandatory code of practice will come into effect in January 2020, months ahead of schedule. It aims to improve the contractual arrangements between the dairy farmers and the dairy processors. The fact remains that it's the third-largest rural industry in Australia. There are 5,700 dairy farmers in Australia now, but that is declining, and 98 per cent of those farms are family owned. The government understands the importance of the mandatory code being delivered as soon as possible in order to provide a clearer safeguard for those farmers who are left, who must be treated as members of the supply chain and appreciated.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  I had to eat dinner in the dark recently, and it was harder than I thought it would be. Danielle Verhoeven, from the Blue Mountains, has a rare condition—Usher syndrome—which causes hearing loss and progressive blindness. At 41, she still has some useful central vision. She works as a telephone triage nurse and is mum to a four-year-old. In spite of her challenges, Danielle feels she has been lucky and she wanted to raise some money for Cure Blindness Australia. Our job during dinner was to see what it was like to eat a meal with little vision or no vision at all. We were inspired by hearing from world blind motorcycle land speed record holder, Ben Felten, another Blue Mountains resident. Ben hit a record 272.596 kilometres an hour last year in South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My aspiration was more modest—I just wanted to eat my meal. My first attempt was with the all-in eye mask, which meant I had no sight at all. As forkfuls of pork made their way slowly to my mouth, I had no idea if I was going to be chewing a big bit or a little piece. I was grateful for the mashed potato and missed half of the asparagus completely. It was easier with the glasses that simulated tunnel vision, but it still required huge amounts of head movement and concentration. It was a terrific fundraising idea and great experience for those of us who only have to cope with things like being a little bit blurry when we take our specs off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The concerns continue for Thompson Square and Windsor Bridge as the replacement project rolls out. I've already called for a better incorporation of some of the salvaged bricks and stones into the new park area, and that the New South Wales government keep the old, heritage listed bridge, which provides a fantastic tourism opportunity to link the two sides of the river. But we've just learnt that more terrible decision-making is happening around this project. I'm outraged to hear that the RMS has just admitted it needs to take an extra 300 metres off Thompson Square because the intersection at George Street will otherwise fail to meet traffic needs. It was obvious from the start of this project that you couldn't merge two lanes into one lane at an intersection just in front of a bridge. It was always a bad plan, but the RMS denied that. But you have to ask: was this their plan all along? Is this why they had a $137 million contingency fund in this project's budget? If it was, why was none of this disclosed to the Hawkesbury community?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of transparency on this project by the New South Wales government has been shameful from the start. The community has fought to save this historic square from this appalling modern concrete monolith going through. Now we know that even less of the oldest public square in Australia will be available for the community. It's an outrage and it should not be happening. We should have had a bypass there from the start.</span>

The Inter-Parliamentary Union, or IPU, was formed in 1889 and today represents 179 parliaments which come together with a shared vision: a world where every vote counts and where democracy and parliaments are at the service of the people for peace and development. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Belgrade last week, we joined over 1,800 other parliamentarians from all over the world in sessions which addressed the IPU's core work: peace, democracy, human rights, gender equality, youth empowerment and sustainable development. I was honoured to have the chance to address delegates concerning Australia's leading contribution on the abolishment of all forms of chemical weapons. I was pleased to reaffirm to our international colleagues that Australia consistently and strongly condemns the use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, under any circumstances. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can report to the House that the 141st IPU assembly adopted an important resolution. It called on all parliamentarians to put in place legislation to achieve universal health coverage by 2030. This supports the political declaration adopted at the 74th Session of the United Nations General Assembly high-level meeting in September. The resolution calls on parliaments to use all their power to hold their respective national governments accountable for the effective implementation of this commitment. It calls on them to monitor the impact of universal health coverage policies and programs and to establish parliamentary mechanisms to measure progress on achieving access to health care for all by 2030. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are, of course, very fortunate in Australia to already boast one of the world's finest universal healthcare systems. Many nations cannot say the same. Indeed, having listened to the many challenges faced by people all over the world, I was reminded forcibly that, once again, Australia is truly the most magnificent country in the world: no war; no endemic corruption; universal health care; generous social security; a strong defence force; a stable democracy; relative safety and freedom for all, including our elected representatives; a national budget back in the black; respect for the rule of law; and a beautiful environment. We have a lot to be thankful for in this country. We should all be encouraged and reassured. Despite the gloom and doom peddled by some in our society, the world is not going to come to an end tomorrow nor in 2030. Australia is forging ahead and I am very, very proud to be part of a government that is doing just that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  I stand today to acknowledge a wonderful community initiative in my electorate of Indi. It brings together some of my great passions: renewable energy, affordable housing and support for low-income families. BeyondHousing is the largest community housing organisation in Victoria's Goulburn and Ovens Murray regions. It provides supports for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. It's working at the frontline to help them in a constructive, grounded way. Many households have cost-of-living pressures. High energy costs are one of them, eating into valuable household budgets. Wodonga is in the top 30 Victorian postcodes for electricity disconnection, and across the regions the rate of disconnections is higher than in our cities. People who cannot afford to pay for power are at risk of homelessness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This project responds to both challenges: affordable housing and affordable power. It's an inspired collaboration between BeyondHousing and Renewable Albury Wodonga Energy, a community group advocating for renewables uptake on the border. As one of the first projects of its kind, four-kilowatt solar systems supplied by Solar Integrity have been installed at 10 BeyondHousing properties. The systems include digital monitors. So, for the first time, householders can see their energy use: when and how they're using it. The BeyondHousing chief executive, Celia Adams, says, 'Reducing natural resource use through renewable energy uptake is a key priority for the organisation and the householders it supports.' The new solar scheme reduces power costs in these homes and allows householders to keep the savings for other costs such as medical and school bills. It also encourages householders to talk about sustainability, renewable energy and power use. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jackie, who shares her home with her five children, was one of the first project recipients. She says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I now have a chance to see how we use energy and to make some practical changes that help my family pay less on electricity and have more for my children's health and education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Katie, whose home was fitted with solar power systems, her household budget is better off. So is the world beyond her roofline. 'On a tight budget and renting, you don't think you've got the means to reduce your impact on the environment and use solar power,' she says, 'But this solar system has given us the chance to be part of caring for our planet in an everyday way.' I salute the householders, BeyondHousing, Solar Integrity and the Victorian government for taking the lead on this important initiative, and I look forward to the program's ongoing development in Wodonga and its rollout in Wangaratta, my home town.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge Gwenyth Sneesby and her ongoing service to our country. Gwenyth was born in Northbridge on 17 June 1924. Following her father's retirement from the Navy and a short time of living in England, her family moved back to Australia, settling in Turimetta Street in Mona Vale. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gwenyth, at the ripe age of 18, became one of the first females to enlist in the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, on 9 December 1942. When asked why she joined the Navy, she exclaimed, 'My father was a Navy man, so the Navy was in my blood.' After completing her basic training on the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Penguin</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> Gwenyth was one of only 10 females who served on the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Kuttabul</span>. Fatefully, she was off duty the night two Japanese midget submarines entered Sydney Harbour and sunk the ship. Gwenyth's gallant service persisted throughout the war. Her artistic aptitude saw her selected to draw charts on a degaussing range in Bradley's Head. Her job was to help electrical officers eliminate the magnetic field surrounding Australian ships, keeping them safe atop of the perilous magnetic mines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To this day, Gwenyth fondly reminisces on her time in the Navy, cherishing the camaraderie of her female compatriots. It is with this camaraderie that Gwenyth continues to contribute to our community. Although Gwenyth has retired from her role as a diligent volunteer for the charity Meals on Wheels, she has taken up a new role as an activities officer at Pittwater retirement village and she continues to contribute to the wider community as an active branch member of the Pittwater RSL. Her affable attitude and compassion are commendable. It is within this community service that we can see Gwenyth's life motto in action: 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to recognise Gwenyth as an outstanding member of the northern beaches community. I'd like to pay tribute to the considerable contributions she has made to both our country and our community. To this day, Gwenyth continues to bring her imaginative, considerate and adventurous attitude to our community. After calling Mona Vale her home for 86 years, Gwenyth faithfully maintains that she 'wouldn't want to do anything else apart from live in Mona Vale'. It is on that note that I am more than proud to declare: we are fortunate to have her in our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  In the raucous hubbub of parliament, it's amazing how some of the most important issues in this country can sometimes go little noticed, barely remarked upon. As is often the case, the quiet voices of the powerless carry the most important, powerful messages. The relationship between MPs and their constituents is important, because our constituents rely upon us to be their champions. As local members know, when the phones start running hot, when the letters come piling in and when people stop us in the streets, it tells us that someone somewhere has done something right or, more commonly, done something very wrong. It's a great part of the straight-talking, non-deferential, egalitarian Australian character, as well as the vital lifeblood of how our direct democracy works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the opposition spokesperson for the NDIS and government services, it is my job as an MP and a shadow to speak truth to power. Having reimmersed myself in the world of disability and NDIS, I want to speak about the problems that some parent pensioners, and therefore their families, are facing, including financial pressure from the government. There is an issue that many out there have not heard much about, but it is very real to a good number of pensioners. It is an issue that can be fixed if the quieter Australians are not just cited by the Prime Minister but respected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a thing in this country called the Pension Loans Scheme. It enables older people who own property to get a boost to their cash flows. In effect, the government takes a part mortgage and charges an interest fee, and the older person gets to unlock some of the equity in their home to meet their financial expenses. The government is essentially acting as a bank for older people with mortgages. It has a good-hearted public service goal at heart. But, when the Reserve Bank cut the official cash rate to a record 0.75 per cent on 1 October, this led to bank loan rates at three per cent and, indeed, as low as 2.9 per cent while the government's Pension Loans Scheme is still charging older Australians at 5.25 per cent. Even private sector versions of the Pension Loans Scheme like the ME Bank have dropped their rates of reverse mortgage to 5.15 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are good, important questions here. Why is the government-run scheme no cheaper than a bank? Why is it that the banks have a bigger heart than the Liberal-National government? Why won't the government, who calls upon its mates in the banks to pass on the Reserve's interest rate cuts in full, do what it's telling others to do? Will the Treasurer investigate himself as he's asked the ACCC to investigate the banks? Why should the government be able to borrow money at about one per cent and massively profiteer from old-age pensioners by not cutting their own rate? The unkind might call this a pensioners tax, a retirees tax or, indeed, a Morrison death tax. I call upon the government to fix this shocking situation, stop being hypocrites, pass on the cuts and stop gouging older Australians and pensioners, who have done nothing to deserve this.</span>

This important infrastructure project has been planned since the mid-1980s, and I really appreciate the fact that the federal Liberal government's $28 million commitment in 2016 has finally made this construction a reality. This government's contribution represents 80 per cent of the cost of the project. In doing so, the government is supporting the 100 jobs that will be required to deliver this project. I know you might find this hard to believe, but federal Labor opposed this project. We actually had Labor senators making speeches in their chamber, opposing this project.</span>

Roadworks to build the new freeway on-ramp connecting to the southbound freeway lines will begin in the coming weeks. Works will be undertaken on and around Manning Road between Ley Street and the Kwinana Freeway in Como and continue until mid-2020.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This project will deliver a series of key road network changes that include a new southbound lane on the Kwinana Freeway from the Canning Highway on-ramp to the Edgewater Road footbridge in Salter Point, the construction of a new merge lane from the on-ramp to the freeway heading south, closing off access from Lockhart Street to Manning Road, providing left-only access at Edgecombe Street to Manning Road and the installation of cabling for future signals at the intersection of Manning Road and Clydesdale Street, and constructing a right-turn pocket from Manning Road to Clydesdale Street south as well as providing for the further installation of traffic signals at that intersection. This project will not only provide a new route for users to travel south on the Kwinana Freeway from Manning Road but will also reduce travelling time and congestion, which is part of our congestion-busting program. In doing so, this project will significantly improve safety for road users within my electorate and reduce traffic numbers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  Trade is good. I welcome the passage of the Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru trade agreements through the House of Representatives. I represent Darwin, the northern capital of Australia. As far as the Northern Territory is concerned, having an agreement with Indonesia, in particular, as one of our closest neighbours, and increasing engagement with Indonesia, is an overwhelmingly good thing. We face north and we ask the parliament to face north towards us in Darwin and the Northern Territory, but more broadly to face north into the massive opportunities in the Indo-Pacific region. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very proud to have been appointed by the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, as the chair of the Indo-Pacific trade task force. I've been working closely with our shadow trade minister, Madeleine King, the member for Brand, who has been working hard to get some commitments from the government on the trade deals that have been passed by the House of Representatives this year. Well done to the shadow trade minister. She secured commitments from the Morrison government to ensure that the implementation of these three trade agreements will safeguard Australian jobs and address the real concern of exploitation of foreign workers. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms King wrote to the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, who, in his response, has made a number of commitments, including: the termination of the existing bilateral investment treaty with Indonesia, the BIT; a review of older-style investment dispute settlement regimes to ensure they contain modern safeguards, which is going to be overwhelmingly good for previous agreements as well as future agreements; an assessment of the operation of the ISDS mechanism in a review of the Indonesia agreement that the government has agreed to mandate five years after the agreement enters into force; and a commitment not to use the provisions of the Indonesia agreement to extend any labour market testing waivers in any future agreement on contractual service suppliers. These are important commitments to have confirmed. Further, there is a commitment to ensure working holiday-makers are not exploited and that they are qualified for work that is undertaken— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  Over the weekend I was delighted to participate in a couple of really important events in the Lyne electorate. The Camden Haven Show at the Kendall showground was an outrageous success. The grand parade had vintage cars, fire service people, all the stock and display animals, and a lot of youth in their comical make-up for their horses. I would also like to congratulate some of the exhibiters, particularly in the beef cattle industry. The reserve champion, Chloe Bisley, and the grand champion, Jasmin Madden, are both still at school and have already established their own cattle breeding studs. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to give a shout-out to the organisers and volunteers at Wingham Akoostik Music Festival, which kicked off last Friday evening. Donna Ballard and her husband and the team have done a tremendous job putting together an enormous festival. I was really proud and delighted to be able to secure $20,000 from the community stream of the Building Better Regions Fund to allow this wonderful festival, in its 13th year, to grow and build. Thousands of locals turned up. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to congratulate the ladies of the Port Macquarie Hastings Breast Cancer Support Group, who have been getting out and about all over the Hastings Valley in the last couple of weeks. The local coordinator of the support group, Judith Hutchesson, and her wonderful team of volunteers, Gloria Caswell, Daphne Latham and Carolyn Gorton, were on hand at the Wauchope IGA the other day to share resources and raise awareness as well as to secure funds for the Breast Cancer Network. There were 100 pink lady silhouettes on display to remind people of those in the region who have died of breast cancer. Selling raffle tickets to raise money and awareness is a really important role in the fight against a very common disease. Unfortunately, breast cancer affects 50 people a day in Australia. Support groups like this do a valuable job for everyone involved in the journey of living with cancer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to congratulate them because they're not a flash in the pan; they've been doing this for years. The cancer spectrum of treatments has been a really exciting space to be involved in; we have so many new wonderful drugs and treatments because of the cutting-edge pharmaceuticals that we list on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Many of the people in this support group are alive and well now because of these wonderful new treatments. This period running up to summer is a great time for everyone in Hastings valley. I wish all similar community groups all the best.</span>

                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  By all accounts, Vida Goldstein made her mark in 1902 as the first Aussie to visit a US President in the White House. Prominent abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison described the suffragette as carrying a youthful, audacious, unrestrained and free spirit, embracing Australia's absence of an immoral shackle against progress. This is the spirit that I bring to my second term in the House of Representatives, and I thank the people of Goldstein for the privilege and for their trust.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't represent Goldstein if you are not fiercely proud of your liberalism. On 18 May, Goldstein voted for a forward-looking, modern liberalism that reflects our community's values to shape the direction of the nation. Sir Robert Menzies understood that defining Australia's future is not a choice between the accelerator of progressivism and the brake of conservativism; it is a choice about whether we want to steer either to a socialist or to a liberal future. Menzies knew that for Australian liberalism to enjoy a social licence it must be built on the pillars of freedom, justice and responsibility, empowering individuals, families and communities in pursuit of national, economic and social progress. Menzies knew Australia needed a liberalism built on pluralism and respect, recognising that there are a lot of people we will encounter who think that there ought to be a species of drab uniformity. This passion for uniformity is not to be encouraged. What we need in Australia is for every person from some particular race or faith who comes into the Australian community to retain their quality in that sense but add to the qualities of all the other people.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Menzies' modern Liberalism fostered equal opportunity and social mobility while safeguarding dignity and respecting sacrifice, delivering intergenerational justice through economic, social and environmental stewardship not only between those who are living but between those who are living, those who are dead and those who are to be born. Menzies' audacious modern liberalism was captured in his 1965 address to the Liberal Party's federal conference, when he said:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">… we have won because we have been the party of innovations. Not the party of the past, not the conservative party dying hard on the last barricade, but the party of innovations.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">These were innovations, these were evidences of a lively mind and a forward-looking heart.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">He finished by saying:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">The years to come have arrived. Menzies' words of 54 years ago called us to the restoration of this vision and to bring these values alive in contemporary debates. They are more contemporary now than ever. In the past two years, Australians have had two opportunities to vote for the type of country they want to be—first, for a forward-looking social liberal agenda and, also, for a lower-tax economic liberal agenda. Both were in the affirmative.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is more work to be done. Liberalism strengthens citizens and communities, not centralised capitals or corporates. This should be the anchor by which we approach Indigenous Australians seeking self-determination through their freedom to take responsibility. One of the most unifying developments of recent years has been the integration of Indigenous history, culture, symbols and language into our national civic life. It's a yearning to recognise that we are all part of the continuum of this continent's journey and story through empowerment in the pursuit of national unity. As Indigenous leader Rachel Perkins argued, the pathway to reconciliation can be a two-way mirror. We acknowledge you; you acknowledge us; we become one. As we say in the Arrernte community, country: one land, one mob.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Last term we turned Liberal values into action. Among many achievements, we incentivised investment and cut taxes, leading to the creation of more than 1,000 new jobs a day. New PBS listings for medicines brought the frontiers of biomedical research to the bedside. We empowered working parents through childcare reform and secured Australia's future by building 50 new ships for our defence industry plan. From the backbench we led the abandonment of the China Extradition Treaty. And, as evidenced by recent events in Hong Kong, which I have witnessed, this was the most significant yet unremarked event of the last parliament. We took a strong stand against the politics of race in One Nation, who drape themselves in the flag and concurrently fan social division with the purpose of empowering themselves at the expense of our national unity. We succeeded in having government adopt an objective standard definition of harassment to limit the possible excesses of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. We redefined proposals to confront the inequity of unlimited tax- free income and superannuation, while encouraging sacrifice and saving for a secure retirement for millions of Australians. We secured greater medical privacy protection for the My Health record system. With the Australian people, we delivered marriage equality, and I'm sure fellow rainbow rebels are proud of the journey we took to enlarge the freedom for couples to make voluntary commitments of mutual respect. And we stood up to Labor's smear campaign to shut down the economic committee's inquiry on refundable franking credits. Our inquiry gave Australians a platform to voice their opposition to Labor's insidious attempt to steal the overpaid tax of nearly one million Australian retirees and low-income earners.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election, the Goldstein Liberal team ran on three pillars. The first was lower taxes. We promised a plan for lower taxes and we have already delivered it. You should keep more of what you earn. You should have the freedom to choose not have your choices dictated to you by people in this chamber. It's your money not ours. The second was retirement security. At the election retirees saw their bank balance on the ballot. Retirement security depends on certainty and the re-election of the coalition government stopped Labor's retiree tax. And we will deliver on our promise not to change superannuation taxes for the life of this parliament. The third was improving lifestyle. Goldstein is a residential retreat. While lacking much industry we are industrious. Every day thousands of residents grow small businesses and commute to professional jobs. They don't want a government to solve their problems; they want a government who protects their rights while improving their quality of life. Our government will deliver, having committed $24.5 million for Bayside and Glen Eira to develop hundreds of new car parking spaces at local railway stations to ease daily commutes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Every parent wants to see their child succeed. We are backing the next generation of Australians by delivering record public, Catholic and independent school funding. We're addressing the inequity faced by young women in sporting infrastructure through an additional $4.7 million investment in a new regional netball facility in Sandringham, as well as many other local investments in sporting grounds. That's in addition to our record investment in local hospitals and full Medicare licensed MRIs at Cabrini Brighton and Holmesglen Moorabbin.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Our lifestyle also comes from stewarding our local environment and protecting the health of Port Phillip and taking proportionate action to safeguard the climate. The coalition has twice taken Australia's commitments to cut emissions under the Paris Agreement to an election, and voters expect it to be honoured through a range of measures to lead the transition of the energy grid and to improve industrial energy efficiency through our Energy Productivity Plan, and we will deliver it. Our local cities of Glen Eira and Bayside are leading the way by enabling residents to recycle their food waste as part of a holistic package for the country. Port Phillip already faces challenge from pollutants, water quality and coastal erosion. We can show how local leadership can deliver environmental outcomes of national importance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently a Labor MP said the worst thing he could do is mislead workers. The same is true of Liberal MPs to citizens. Put simply, business as usual won't secure another 29 years of uninterrupted economic growth. At elections governments seek mandates based on a specific set of circumstances and from time to time events provide their own. In those situations governments are rarely judged by the circumstances that they find themselves in; they are judged by their response. As chair of the House Economics Committee, again I carry a responsibility to lead discussions on the economic health of the nation and will. The environment we presently find ourselves in is one which is highly exposed to external shocks, with high public and private debt, limited fiscal levers and very low interest rates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">At the beginning of this term I deliberately communicated my concern about the Reserve Bank continuing to cut interest rates. In 2012, the RBA identified that low rates are an increasingly fraught stimulus strategy. Retirees have more interest-bearing assets, and households with a large amount of interest-bearing assets may also adjust their spending in response to a change in interest rates. Interest-bearing assets are expected to grow over time as the population ages, and it has continued on that trajectory.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Most people approach policy in politics based on their stage of life. Over time, the youthful desire for opportunity gradually turns to a desire for security as people look to their retirement with an aspiration for independence, dignity and choice. The recent focus on the impact of deeming rates on disposable income highlights this point. Some are now, rightly, questioning the wisdom of cutting rates and following the rest of the world down the economic sinkhole of the low-interest-rate-growth path. As one observer noted, the derivatives markets expect the cash rate to average below one per cent for the next five years, and we're now there. Of course this now seems optimistic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Deliberate cultivation of higher debt through low interest rates is a one-way journey, with scant opportunity for a U-turn. Security for older Australians is akin to opportunity for younger Australians to get a good education, a rewarding job, to buy a home and to raise a family. Yet that is compromised when monetary policy is inflating house prices, thereby making it harder for young Australians to get their first foothold on the property ladder. The RBA's own model of the Australian housing market identifies that much of the strength in housing prices and construction over the past few years can be explained by the fall in interest rates. As Menzies himself understood, our people are entitled to good homes at a cost which bears some proper relation to their earnings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What we also know is that rising house prices deny a disproportionate share of the nation's scarce capital to investment and productive activities, and needlessly eat into the economic equity of the nation. Disturbingly, the legitimacy of quantitative easing has been socialised and, as Rupert Murdoch argued in 2014, quantitative easing increases the price of assets such as stocks and real estate, and that has helped first and foremost those who already have assets.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TIM WILSON:</span>
                </a>  Before the break I was speaking about quantitative easing. If introduced in Australia's current economic environment, it will keep asset prices high for those who've had a go and be paid for by higher prices for those who want a go.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Most people view the tax system through a specific prism based on what is contributing horizontally across today's societal spread, according primarily to income. A modern, liberal tax system would also reflect the vertical contribution across people's stages of life and respect the need for intergenerational equity and the assistance parents provide for their vulnerable children, as well as when the situation is reversed. To quote the Productivity Commission:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On average, families in the under-60 age groups pay $15 300 more per year in taxes than they receive in transfers. By contrast, families in the 60+ age group receive an average of $10 900 more in transfers than they pay in taxes. …. In total, families in the 60+ age group account for 51 per cent of all transfer expenditure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The data is just the symptom, it is not the cause. The rise of transfers is being driven by rising healthcare and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme costs at the most expensive stage of people's lives, along with increasing demands for pensions and aged care support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We should respect that older Australians have paid taxes throughout their lives and at different rates to today, but not through a tax bondage on the next generation which constrains their freedom to choose. With nearly half of all federal taxes coming from income, the only solution governments have found is to increase migration of working-age people to help shoulder the increasing expenditure burden, putting economic, infrastructure and environmental pressure on our nation and contributing to the perception that our economic model is fundamentally flawed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <span style="font-style:italic;" />One of our strengths is that Australia has found peace and prosperity as an open economy and a liberal society, but the lessons of human history educate us on its fragility. The cost of inaction will hit every Australian in the form of lower growth, higher unemployment and structural imbalances that favour the established against the aspirational. With many states failing to use their stamp duty windfalls during property price peaks to rebase their taxation receipts, the Commonwealth has an opportunity to put new revenue sources on the table to redress the legacy of vertical fiscal imbalance. As Charles Adams wrote in his inspirational tome, <span style="font-style:italic;">For Good and Evil: the Impact of Taxes on the Course of Civilisation</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Taxes which touch a broad range of economic activities, even with equal rates, will inevitably be mildly progressive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge we face collectively is one of exposure. Resulting from the United States embracing quantitative easing in the past, comparable economies have had no choice but to exhaust their monetary policy options as well. Their balance sheets are also thin, with little left in the fiscal tank. Meanwhile, structural reform is politically challenging and the dividend is slow and diffused; it is low GI. Yet redress of structural imbalances inevitably leads to a modern, liberal economic reform vision for the 21st century, one which works to confront the productivity challenges of a modern Australia in a competitive global economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">On tax, there should be flattening of discrepancies between income, company and capital gains tax, as well as broadening the use of consumption taxes that multinational businesses and individuals pay across business and life cycles. On energy, we're embracing the fact that the debate is no longer defined solely by the price of the fuel but by the combination of the risks to return from long-run investments that are exposed to finance network risks, as well as an environmental legacy footprint. On industrial relations, moving away from a confrontational model that assumes employers want fewer employees will assist them to understand that the greatest struggle for businesses is the hiring and retention of talent by having a system designed to ease hire over constraining legitimate fire.</span>

                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  It is indeed an honour and a privilege to have been re-elected to serve as the member for Shortland for a second time. I am only the fourth person to serve in this role in the seat's 70-year history, so I am particularly aware of the special responsibility I have to the people I represent. I sincerely thank my constituents for placing their trust in me for the next three years. It has indeed been a privilege to represent them in the national parliament for the past three years, and I am excited by the opportunity to continue to be their voice. This is my third term in the House, having served my first term in the 44th Parliament as the member for Charlton. I am as aware today of the awesome responsibility I have as the representative of the people in my electorate as I was on the first day I spoke in this place in 2013.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to begin with some words of thanks, most importantly to my wife and children for their unwavering love and constant support for me in my job. Each of us in the House is aware of the huge burden our representation places on our families. My family is everything to me, and I want them to be the first of my acknowledgements. I also want to acknowledge the rank-and-file members of the Labor Party who again gave me their confidence to be our party's candidate in Shortland, I thank them and all the many supporters and volunteers who assisted in assuring that Shortland returned a Labor member of parliament. Finally, I thank my dedicated staff for their coordination of the campaign and their ongoing support of me and our constituents.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also honoured that my Labor colleagues have supported me to be a shadow minister, and I thank my friend the Leader of the Opposition for giving me the chance to serve as the shadow minister for international development and the Pacific, shadow minister assisting for climate change and shadow minister assisting for defence. These three policy areas are enormously challenging and inextricably linked. Fighting climate change is an issue of international and intergenerational equity, and our closest neighbours in the Pacific deserve our support and leadership. With shadow foreign minister Penny Wong, I am working to advance our agenda to engage with other nations in the Pacific as part of our efforts to foster and preserve peace, prosperity, stability and security in the region—efforts that are fundamental to Australia's own national security.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a deep interest in contributing to global poverty alleviation, but coalition governments have abandoned our commitment to aid funding and slashed our International Development Assistance Program budget by an incredible $11.8 billion in the six years they have been in power. This is a source of international embarrassment for Australia and, indeed, is at odds with the generous spirit of Australian people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite advocating the Pacific step-up as a signature foreign policy, the government continues to demonstrate that this step up is cynical window-dressing, as it merely funnels $500 million of existing aid funds to the Pacific, which has resulted in the withdrawal of aid funding from other parts of the world. For example, Pakistan has been denuded of Australian aid funding. Given that Pakistan is at the heart of the struggle against Islamic extremism, this is a very short-sighted and counterproductive move.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the so-called Pacific step up, the Prime Minister has let down our Pacific neighbours by failing to act on climate change, which they have identified as the most important issue they face and one that threatens their very existence. Australia signed up to the Boe declaration last year, when we acknowledged and agreed that climate change was the No. 1 existential threat to the entire Pacific region, including Australia. Mr Morrison had the opportunity to commit to real action on climate change at the Pacific Island leaders forum in August, but he let the Pacific down and he let Australia down when he watered down the Pacific Island leaders communique on climate change, removing the word 'crisis' and replacing it with 'reality'. Yes, climate change is certainly a reality for people in low-lying Pacific islands, but it is also a crisis—a crisis for which this government has no plan. We saw the Prime Minister's arrogant attitude to the people of the Pacific, repeated in the words of his deputy not long after. In a leaked video, the Deputy Prime Minister said the Pacific Islands would survive climate change because their workers could come to Australia to 'pick our fruit'. It was a disgraceful comment, and the ramifications of that remark were felt widely across the Pacific, further damaging our reputation and credibility with our important neighbours. In fact, I was talking to a key stakeholder group, and one particular individual had just come back from Fiji. His taxi driver on the way to the airport actually raised the Deputy Prime Minister's remarks with him directly. This is permeating all through the Pacific.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also undermined the Pacific Labour Scheme, which was designed to bring Pacific workers to Australia to help fill worker shortages here as well as provide an economic and skills boost to Pacific countries, when at the same time it was loosening the controls around the backpacker visa. Instead of attracting 2,000 workers in its first year, the Pacific Labour Scheme attracted only 200, meaning $8 million worth of wages that would have been repatriated to Pacific nations was not paid. That happened because the foreign minister was clearly rolled in cabinet by the Nationals, who were trying to loosen the backpacker visa to introduce an agriculture visa by the back door. This undermines the Pacific Labour Scheme and is having a really negative impact in the region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this month, the Morrison government has shown its mean spirit towards some of the world's poorest with its disappointingly modest contribution to the Sixth Replenishment Conference of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. While Australia pledged $242 million, that fell well short of the 15 to 20 per cent increase from other developed countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and France. It should be noted that the government has so far contributed only half of the $220 million it pledged to the Global Fund 2017 to 2019 round. We'll be keeping a close eye on that.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">In the area of defence, it is a pleasure to return to a policy area I'm familiar with, having worked as a principal policy adviser to the former member for Charlton, Greg Combet, when he was Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science in the Rudd-Gillard Labor governments. During that time I had the honour of contributing to Labor's defence industry policy, the establishment of the projects-of-concern process and the Mortimer procurement reforms, which were the most substantial reforms to defence procurement in a generation. Yet under this government with its revolving door of defence ministers we have seen more than a dozen critical Australian Defence Force capability acquisition projects running years behind schedule. These schedule blowouts across multibillion dollar projects could have a real impact on the ground for Defence Force personnel. The delays have been worsening this year, which indicates that the government is failing to manage defence capability acquisition projects effectively. In the three months from December 2018 the government allowed six defence projects, worth more than $6 billion, to be delayed for nearly a cumulative 10 years. That is a 10-year delay in only three months of project administration. In total, 14 major defence capability acquisition projects worth nearly $15 billion are running late by a cumulative total of 310 months, or 25 years. The revolving door of defence ministers under this Liberal government is clearly contributing to project blowouts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In the six years since the Liberals came to office, defence ministers have conducted only three project-of-concern summits, despite defence policy stating that a ministerial summit should be held every six months. In fact, in news coming out of the Defence annual report, only this week, we've seen a $570 million blowout in Defence's sustainment budget in only one year, and it's clearly related to the fact that project delays are leading to the ADF being forced to run existing equipment longer and harder than they planned for. We also saw a $3.7 billion typo in the Defence budget, where they had part of the Future Submarine project in the wrong column. That's a very significant typo and yet again reinforces the fact that this government simply cannot be trusted to administer such an important portfolio as Defence. In parliament last month the Minister for Defence Industry, Melissa Price, said:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As the Minister for Defence Industry, my priorities are clear: defence capability is built on time, on budget and on spec.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">She is clearly failing the test set by herself.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of climate change, I continue to work with the shadow minister, the member for Hindmarsh, in this important policy area, and this week I seconded his private member's motion calling on this government to declare a climate emergency. This is not empty tokenism or alarmist politics, as those on the other side might suggest. Climate change is a significant threat to our economy, our natural environment, our farming communities and our national security. Australia's emissions have been rising every year under this government and are projected to continue to rise. Australia must take serious action to meet our commitments under the Paris treaty, and yet all this government is interested in is fudging the numbers, using dodgy accounting tricks with our Kyoto carryover credits to make it appear we are actually doing something. Well, the Australian people know better. The hundreds of thousands who marched—</span>

                </a>  As I was saying, climate change is a significant threat to our economy, our natural environment, our farming communities and our national security. Australia's emissions have been rising every year under this government and are projected to continue to rise. Australia must take serious action to meet our commitments under the Paris treaty, yet all this government is interested in is fudging the numbers. The Australian people know better. The hundreds of thousands who have marched and signed petitions know better. But this government maintains this inadequate target—a target that, despite its inadequacy, they still won't reach. Combating climate change is one of the great challenges of our time, but it's also one of the most important, and I will continue to call on the Morrison government to take stronger action on climate change.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to update the House on issues about which my constituents come to me for assistance. Unfortunately, many of them have not changed over the past six years I've been a representative at this place. At the top of the list are Centrelink, telephone scams, the NDIS and aged care. Unfortunately, one of the main complaints I still continue to receive from constituents relates to Centrelink and particularly to waiting times—both waiting endlessly on hold on the phone to speak to someone and also waiting for applications to be processed. It's no wonder the government has changed the title of the minister responsible for Centrelink from Minister for Human Services to Minister for Government Services; the people I represent who rely on Centrelink certainly wouldn't identify humanity as being an objective they'd use to describe their experiences with Centrelink.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a criticism of the professional, hardworking staff who are employed at Centrelink. My criticism is aimed directly at the government for slashing and burning this vital public service. One of my constituents waited over 180 days for her application for the pension to be processed. This should be taken in the context of the average application taking 49 days to be approved, which in itself is absolutely appalling.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CONROY:</span>
                </a>  As I was discussing, one of my constituents had their pension application take over six months, which is over three times as long as it should take. This is, of course, not surprising from a Prime Minister who has told senior Australians who have worked all their lives, paid their taxes and played by the rules that they should not rely on the age pension because it is a welfare entitlement. What disgusting contempt from the man who holds the highest office in the land. Judy, who had to wait the 180 days for her pension, had to stop working because of illness when she was 60. While she was waiting for the pension to be processed she had to use nearly all of her bank savings. Judy said, 'It shouldn't be this hard for people who are honest and have worked all their lives,' and I agree with her.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just elderly Australians that this government treats with such contempt. Another constituent waited over 200 days to have his youth allowance application processed. He applied in January this year and the application wasn't processed until August—well into semester 2 of the university year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also shown its disregard for people on Newstart, who are also left waiting and are forced to use their meagre savings before they can access the payment. Despite a chorus of calls from many segments of our society, including, ironically, former Prime Minister Howard, and the member for New England, the government will not raise the Newstart allowance, despite it being a lowly $40 a day. I am yet to hear anyone credibly say that they can survive on $40 a day, let alone equip themselves with everything needed to find work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Another major issue in my office is telephone scams. More than one in five people I represent are over the age of 65. This age group is particularly vulnerable to scams and are harassed the most by them. There are tangible ways the government could be acting on this increasing problem, yet they continue to drag their heels on what is a daily nuisance for many of my constituents. I note that the communications minister has very recently issued a formal directive to the Australian Communications and Media Authority that from April next year all telecommunications companies must use a two-factor authentication process when transferring mobile phone numbers from one provider to another, and that is a welcome decision. But, considering Telstra, Optus and Vodafone already use this authentication process, this directive is a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed to combat telephone scams in this country. Around the world governments are trying out different systems and technologies to stop the scammers. In the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand tackling scammers is a priority. But in Australia we are still waiting for a report from ACMA as part of the scant technology project it has led since 2017. This report must be delivered two years after it was initiated and must lay out a plan to deliver real protections and noticeable improvements for the elderly and vulnerable people who are being harassed in their homes every day.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS is another issue on which my office is regularly asked for help. I'm proud to be a representative of the Hunter and Central Coast regions. The Hunter was one of the trial sites for the NDIS, so my constituents who participated in the NDIS trial have been involved in the system for six years now. Feedback I too often receive is that one of the fundamental flaws of the scheme is that it relies too much on the advocacy skills of a participant or their family to navigate the system and address issues when they arise. This should not be the case. The NDIS is helping some of the most vulnerable Australians, and participants should not have to rely on family and friends or the office of their member of parliament when they face a hurdle with their plan. The scheme should be much more streamlined and user-friendly. It is shameful that the government have underspent on the NDIS to the tune of $1.6 billion and then tried to hide behind the excuse that the scheme is demand-driven. They are stomping down on the demand through their cuts and mismanagement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It is shameful that they have not fully staffed the National Disability Insurance Agency. By their own actions this month the Liberals finally admitted the rigid staffing cap they imposed on the NDIA in 2014 has been hurting people living with disability and depriving them of much needed goods and services. While Labor welcomes the lifting of the cap by 800 employees to 4,000, this is still a long way short. The NDIA originally estimated that staffing levels would be 10,595 by 2018-19, more than double what has actually been achieved. To add insult to injury, the bill to the taxpayers for consultants and contractors has ballooned from $70 million in 2016 to $430 million in 2018.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">All MPs know that people seeking help under the NDIS wait too long for their plan, too long for reviews and too long to access support. They find the agency and the online portal very difficult to negotiate. They find it hard to understand why their plans are cut and impossible to find a person to talk to. Once again, it should not be this hard. The government should fully fund the scheme, fully staff the agency and deliver people the support they have been promised and the supports they need. Sadly, when the mission of the NDIS moved covertly from choice and control of the participant to what is deemed reasonable and necessary by the planner, a fundamental change occurred in the NDIS that has been very detrimental. The NDIS as a contract is about who we are as a people. Australians are fundamentally decent and generous and believe that people living with disability should live their best lives. It is not good enough that they struggle as they do.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue that is raised frequently by my constituents is access to aged care—in particular, home care packages. Some of the stories of neglect and abuse in residential aged care emerging from the royal commission are truly shocking. It's just as alarming to realise that 120,000 older Australians are waiting for care at home—some up to two years—and that 16,000 have very sadly died while waiting for these home care packages. I have written to the royal commissioners asking them to hold a hearing in the Hunter, which would service the large population base of Newcastle, the Hunter Valley, Lake Macquarie and Port Stephens and allow relatively easy access for those on the Central Coast and Mid North Coast, all of which have large aged and retirement populations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Our older Australians deserve quality care. They must be treated with dignity, and the concerns of their families and loved ones must be taken seriously. It seems older Australians are the unfortunate target of many of this government's failings. Those who have managed to put away some meagre savings for retirement are punished by a government which refuses to lower the Centrelink deeming rate, even as the Reserve Bank cuts and cuts interest rates and then cuts them again.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to talk about the economy, because it is also an issue that my constituents raise with me. Economic growth is at its slowest since the global financial crisis, wages are stagnant, almost two million Australians are looking for work or for more work, productivity is going backwards and living standards are going backwards. Collapsing confidence and weak growth are the economic consequences of a government with no plan. This government could raise Newstart, because we know that recipients of Newstart would inject money into the economy. This government could bring forward infrastructure spending, as suggested by the Reserve Bank, by Labor and by many other voices in the community. Unfortunately, in contrast, in five budgets the Morrison government have underspent on infrastructure by more than $5 billion. They talk up the infrastructure plan, but it's off in the never-never. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Australians are doing it tough, and this government has no plan. It will not even acknowledge there is a problem nor even debate it in the House. It has no plan to deal with low wages and rising prices. The cost of essentials is skyrocketing. Electricity prices are increasing. The cost of child care has become unaffordable under the Liberals. Australians are worried about the economy, but Scott Morrison and the Liberals are pretending there is no problem. Labor will continue to hold the government to account on important matters like the economy and their failure on climate change. The people of Australia expect no less from Labor and the people of Shortland expect no less from me as their representative. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I finish where I began—to acknowledge that I'm honoured and privileged to be the fourth representative of the people of Shortland, following in the footsteps of Charlie Griffiths, Peter Morris and Jill Hall and in the footsteps of Greg Combet in Charlton. It is an honour and privilege that I'm forever grateful for, and I recommit myself to the service of the people of Shortland, Lake Macquarie and the Central Coast.</span>

                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  It is an honour to rise for the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's opening of the 46th Parliament. I certainly congratulate, at the outset, the Speaker and deputy speakers on their appointments. I'm humbled to be appointed a member of the Speaker's panel alongside you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am especially honoured to have been returned as the member for Groom. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a significant win for the LNP in Groom. We saw a swing of 5.17 per cent to us, leading to a 70.48 per cent two-party preferred result. I humbly acknowledge this is the highest Liberal result in the country. But let's be very clear: whilst my team and I worked very hard during the campaign and are so very proud of that result, it is due to the efforts of party members and volunteers right across the electorate. It's based on policies that suited our electorate: a focus on infrastructure, tax relief, world-class health and education services, and support for families and small business. This is about a government getting on with the job of getting behind our community so that it can deal with its challenges and pursue its ambitions. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Toowoomba and Darling Downs region, which makes up the electorate of Groom, is where I'm from. From the Jondaryan farm of my early childhood, starting school at Jondaryan State School; living with my family at Centenary Heights, where I attended St Thomas More's and St Joseph's; and then Highfields, where I finished school at Downlands, I left school and home to strike out and study at what is now the University of Southern Queensland. There was football and soccer at school, volunteering in various activities around our city, school and parish roles and sporting club activities with my wife and family. I was a foundation sponsor of the Armitage Centre at the Empire Theatre, there were Rotary and board roles at the Chamber of Commerce, Condamine Alliance natural resource management body, the Toowoomba Catholic education board and Concannon College at USQ. This region is where my wife has taught. It's where we established our agribusiness practice, prior to politics, and it's where we decided to return to raise our family, having worked across the country earlier in our marriage. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that an election is a test of whether a candidate knows and understands their electorate. I'm confident my team and I know Groom, and, more so, I'm confident in our abilities and networks to update that appreciation quite regularly. Of course, many opponents right across the board have argued, still do and no doubt will continue to argue that I and the LNP don't understand or represent our region. I respect that they have a right to their views, and I certainly take on critique and feedback regularly, but the election result shows that we were clearly in line with the concerns and aspirations of the region. I therefore thank the Liberal National Party, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and, most especially, the many party members, volunteers and supporters led by Peter Wilson and John Martlew. Whilst we had so many working on roadsides, functions and polling booths, I'd like to especially mention Boyd Scheuber who, yet again, tirelessly led our prepoll teams for over three weeks, and the many others who simply came out to support my wife, Anita, our family and myself. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to have played a role in flood mitigation in our city following the devastating events of early 2011. From the upgraded East Creek and West Creek junction in our CBD, the inner-city ring road through to the impending East Creek and West Creek upgrades on James Street at the corner of Kitchener Street and adjacent to our PCYC, it's been important to work alongside state colleagues and the Toowoomba Regional Council. The Toowoomba Second Range Crossing was opened only a matter of weeks ago by the Deputy Prime Minister. It's the largest inland road project in the country, and is certainly one that many stakeholders had a hand in. Ultimately, its funding and agreement to proceed were confirmed by the state LNP and federal coalition governments. Warrego Highway upgrades west to Oakey and beyond and numerous bridge upgrades across the Darling Downs are amongst our other achievements. Others include the first PFAS settlement in the nation between the Commonwealth and a landholder, in Oakey; a new LifeFlight helicopter base in Toowoomba servicing southern inland Queensland and, certainly, into northern inland New South Wales as well; the new RSPCA animal shelter under construction at Wellcamp and funding for renovation of the Soldiers Memorial Hall. I'm proud to note that project is now underway with the Toowoomba Regional Council, because the hall is an important facility to mark those who have protected our country and fought for us in so many campaigns. Significant upgrades are underway at the Beaurabe Living aged-care home in Pittsworth, a very significant facility on the central Darling Downs. I'm pleased that we were able to secure funding for the $15 million feasibility study on passenger rail from Toowoomba to Brisbane in last year's budget. There are also numerous other local projects supporting our school communities, sporting clubs and community organisations across the Toowoomba, Pittsworth, Oakey and Highfields districts. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We continue to deal with significant issues in the electorate. The PFAS contamination at Oakey, at the Army aviation base, is similar to that being considered by Defence right around the country. It's something that we've made some progress on with mitigation, and, as I said, there was the first Commonwealth settlement with a landholder in the country. But there's more work to be done to restore the confidence of the Oakey community. Inland Rail, tracking its way across the Darling Downs—in the planning stages—from Melbourne to Brisbane, has both significant and enormous potential benefits that will flow on to our community and across the eastern seaboard. Most importantly for me, at present there is the need for appropriate consideration of potentially affected landholders, who cannot be left to bear the costs of this magnificent project which promises benefits to the nation at large.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We were at an early rollout site for both the NDIS and NBN and, as members in this House recognise, there have been challenges, particularly in regional Australia, with both, but we're making significant progress. I'm pleased with that progress and I acknowledge the efforts of our current ministers under the leadership of the Prime Minister in that regard.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned passenger rail from Toowoomba to Brisbane. I'm pleased that the Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure, Minister Tudge, visited us recently in Toowoomba to consider that as part of the broader South-East Queensland City Deal project, acknowledging, the significance of fast rail connections to the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast as priorities, quite obviously.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that issues we've had to deal with in our electorate include scaremongering about energy. Many said that this was a climate change election. Well, across the Darling Downs we have an amazing array of solar, wind, bio energy and pumped hydro projects either underway or being developed, complementing our traditional coal and gas based energy sources such that those renewable sources are quickly reaching the stage where they will generate more than the traditional sources. If it was a climate change election, the people in Groom voted on that basis. We want to get on with the balanced energy future based on reliability and affordability and the enormous local industry and job creation potential it has for us as we do transition to a lower-emissions future, and that is what we are doing in the Toowoomba and Darling Downs region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">During the election, as was the case in the last, we saw lies from those opposite about health and education funding across Groom. They were simply not true, with every school in the electorate seeing increased federal funding at the same time as unprecedented health funding across the Darling Downs Hospital and Health Service. Of course, I'm very proud of the private services such as St Vincents Hospital and St Andrews Hospital that complement those services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also in Toowoomba considered many contentious social issues in recent years. I have focused on faithfully representing the views of my electorate, based on as thorough consultation as is possible, which is, as per the oath that I took when I was sworn into this place, my duty and that's what I'll continue to do. We have commitments to road works on the New England and Warrego highways. Money has been allocated. We need to urge progress from the state government to get on with the job, and I'm pleased that the Deputy Prime Minister has focused on that. I mentioned earlier that we need further progress with remediation and the management program around PFAS and around the Oakey community and, therefore, further certainty for landholders. We need to consider the interplay between inland rail, a freight project and passenger rail from Toowoomba to Brisbane, and I formally met with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister Tudge about that just yesterday. We need to continue efforts to find a permanent home for the Milne Bay military museum, and I am proud to work alongside the mayor in doing that. We have more work to do on the Highfields connection road and the Quarry Gardens project, alongside other community representatives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We have plenty more challenges to face as a community into the future. Most important at present is drought, but there are also homelessness, domestic violence and flat sectors in our economy, such as the retail sector. I'm pleased that since the election we've had numerous high-level visits to the electorate. Minister Bridget McKenzie, as Australia's first female Minister for Agriculture, made her first dedicated electorate visit to the electorate of Groom. I was pleased to receive her and talk about our beef industry in particular. There was also Minister Mark Coulton visit to look at regional services, mobile black spots in the northern part of the electorate and the official opening of the southern Queensland Rural Health training facility in Toowoomba supported by the University of Southern Queensland, the University of Queensland and Darling Downs Health. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is looking at our infrastructure projects, ag-tech industry potential, small business and certainly banking—particularly Heritage Bank, Australia's largest customer-owned banking organisation, based in Toowoomba. Minister Angus Taylor has an energy perspective, looking at our industry development potential. And Minister Alan Tudge is looking at the South-East Queensland City Deal and Olympics potential from Toowoomba along with the rest of South-East Queensland and especially that passenger rail project.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Deputy Prime Minister is probably our most regular visitor to Groom over recent years, and I was pleased he was there not so long ago to open the unprecedented Toowoomba Bypass, Australia's largest inland road project, at $1.6 billion, 80 per cent funded by the federal government and 20 per cent funded by the state government. Regarding drought, the Prime Minister was on the Darling Downs recently. He briefly caught up with us in Toowoomba. Just this week, on Monday, I had our mayor, Paul Antonio, and Toowoomba Regional Council CEO Brian Pidgeon, together with the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, in the Prime Minister's office talking about long-term water supplies—domestic, agricultural and industrial—for Darling Downs and the Toowoomba region. I'm pleased I've got upcoming visits from Minister David Coleman, regarding our refugee program in Toowoomba, and Minister Stuart Robert, regarding NDIS, in the near future. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When visitors like that come to our region, I tell them about Toowoomba firsts. It is the home of the Southern Cross windmill, iconic in our nation's history, and—although Ipswich debates this with us—the home of the lamington. The winner of the 2019 Prime Minister's Prize for Science, given for her contributions to pure mathematics, Emeritus Professor Cheryl Praeger—of the University of Western Australia nowadays—was born in Toowoomba. We are a source of cultural, scientific and industrial innovation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We're Australia's largest private sector inland city. We are home to Australia's largest customer-owned banking organisation, as I said—Heritage Bank. We are home to the Royal Agricultural Society of Queensland, the first in Queensland, older than the Brisbane Ekka, for example. We have the highest concentration of feedlotting and meat processing in the nation. We have the Pulse Data Centre, the first tier-III large data centre in the country, being established by the local private FKG Group west of Toowoomba. We have the first greenfields development of an internationally capable airport in 40 years, the privately funded Wagners Wellcamp Airport, now linking us across the nation and internationally. Ultimately our diversified economy is our secret. We have one of the most productive agricultural regions in the country. We have a vibrant arts and tourism sector, professional services and retail, health and education facilities servicing southern inland Queensland and northern inland New South Wales, and our emerging ag tech and energy sectors certainly augur well for the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In this parliament I'm proud to be chair of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. Given it focuses so much on defence projects, that work certainly relates to Groom, in terms of our Cabarlah and Oakey bases. I'm also a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I chair the PFAS Subcommittee and sit on both the Defence and Trade Subcommittees, all of which are directly relevant to Groom.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I commit to work with the mayor; councillors; my state colleagues Pat Weir, Trevor Watts and David Janetzki; Oakey Chamber of Commerce; Pittsworth District Alliance; Highfields and District Business Connections Group; Toowoomba Chamber of Commerce; TSBE, our regional economic development organisation; our community groups; faith organisations; Indigenous Australians; non-Indigenous Australians; and new residents alike. I'll continue to work with those who work on community housing, domestic violence, small business, the environment, education and cultural pursuits, among so many others focused on our future. I'll do this with the ongoing tremendous assistance of our electorate office team of Leisa, Clare, Britt, Wendy and Colleen, all so ably led by Megan Brown, for whose efforts I am so very grateful.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I've formally represented our community at the local, state and now federal levels of government over the last decade or more and, as I mentioned, informally through many community and business groups prior to that. I've only been able to do that with my wife, Anita, by my side throughout, as she juggles her own busy career and our family. She is simply my greatest blessing in life. All the while I am surrounded by those I regard as my heroes and my angels: our son, Kevin, and our daughters, Bridget, Meghan, Annabelle, Marita and Tessa.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">For many, parliament and politics is about fanfare, about drama, about sensationalism and simply the grab of the day. For me, it's not about being driven by Twitter and those commentators that come and go. It's about being considered, diligently going about the task of understanding the challenges and the ambitions of the people of Groom, and faithfully representing and advocating for them here in Canberra. Our election results show that we're on the right track. Challenges remain, but I know that it is all about the people of Groom. That is my continued commitment to the Groom electorate. For its families, its people, its workers, businesses and their aspirations and the challenges that they face, that is my continued commitment in this 46th Parliament.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="M3E" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  Here we are just five months after the election and Australia is coming to a complete standstill. It's a bit of a dim memory now, but many of us still recall the campaign of dirty tricks and lies built on fear instead of aspirations. And, clearly, in our electorate of McEwen, we saw the complete lack of a plan for the future that addresses the needs of our modern communities, because what we do have here is a government that has no plan for this country and no plan to deal with rampant economic insecurity. All the while our working families face lower wages, ever-increased costs of living and insecure work futures. But, instead of addressing these concerns, instead of providing policies that work for everyday Australians, what we see is a government formed in the image of its spin doctor Prime Minister—a Prime Minister who is slowly morphing from an ad man without substance to a tin-pot dictator hell-bent on secrecy and not being honest with the Australian people, a Prime Minister who stands in front of chaos with a plastered-on grin and says: 'Nothing to see here, folks. Nothing here to see.' That's what we've seen this country reduced to since the election.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">If recent elections around the world have taught us anything, it's that the economy must work for everyone, not just the select few at the top. Our community is crying out for the growing inequality gap to be reduced. They want to see their pay packets at least match the rise in their daily expenses. Wages are the most stagnant they have been in our nation since the Second World War. Even the RBA, once thought of as the financial cop on the beat containing wage growth in the seventies and eighties, now says that the underlying problem for the Australian economy is the lack of income growth. The wage price index grew a miniscule 2.3 per cent last year, which the government actually tried to frame as a success after record low growth of 1.7 per cent in 2017. And, yet, in the decade and a half leading up to 2013, wage growth was an average of 3.5 per cent a year. That was until Tony Abbott and that well-known friend of the worker came to power.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no coincidence that comparatively the highest wage growth in this country is in my Labor-led state of Victoria. These are all, to some, just numbers on a spreadsheet until you think about the people that are attached to them: the struggling single mum on Newstart who sometimes has to work for a minimum wage at Woolies, the father of three who's behind on the mortgage repayment because he hasn't seen his income increase enough to keep up with everyday spending, the public health nurse who's working harder and harder but taking home comparatively less and less. No wonder the people think that the cards are stacked against them because, under this government, they are. This government is still adhering to the worn-out and disproven economic ideology that tax cuts for the richest people and the most profitable businesses will lead to better lives for workers. I've got news for this government, and so does every major economist in the country: after six years in power, wages haven't got any better and people are struggling more than ever. And the government has no plans to do anything about it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Libs and the Nats love to talk about their credentials on jobs and growth. You'd be forgiven for thinking that's the only thing they can talk about, yet our nation's unemployment rate hides in plain sight: there's booming unemployment in our workforce. As an example, to be counted as employed in Australia you need to only work one hour a week, and with between one and 26 hours per week you are counted as underemployed. It's not good enough that the government does not have a plan for us and our community. It's weak on jobs and weak on growth but hard on workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Another pressing issue for our community is the cost of living. Recently, the price of petrol in Victoria has gone through the roof, skyrocketing by some 40c a litre to $1.74 a litre. This sort of price rise impacts on the ever-narrowing household budget of everyone in the outer north of Melbourne. Add that increase to the interest rate cuts not being passed on by the big banks and the increasing cost of educating our kids, going to the doctor or simple things like switching on the heater in winter or the cooler in summer and there's a perfect storm of headache for the people in my community, who are watching jobs disappear daily. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">People in McEwen make the long drive south in the morning for work and then the long drive north in the evening, hoping to make it home in time for dinner. The price of petrol only adds to their frustration about this government's lack of planning on infrastructure. There has been no major infrastructure spending in the northern part of Melbourne or in northern Victoria in the past six years. That is this government's legacy: making us less efficient as a whole while making us pay through the nose for the essentials of life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker, the member for Groom, spoke about health. This Liberal government has continued to ignore the growing need for health services in my electorate. Like so many electorates on the outskirts of major Australian cities and centres, we have an incredible number of youths and young families in the towns and communities of McEwen. The needs of young people have faced particular neglect from this government. Over 75 per cent of mental health problems occur before the age of 25. Mental health is an area we cannot afford to neglect as a nation. Young people in our community identified suicide prevention, support for drug addiction and help for mental illness as their top three priorities. We know that because we went and asked them what their priorities were. They did what many young people do. They stepped up, they identified an issue and they lobbied for action. That's why at the last election we campaigned strongly for a new headspace in Wallan. Young people are telling us what they need, and we should be listening. At the last two elections I've campaigned for the community of Sunbury to receive a dedicated children's health service in Sunbury, as local services are failing to keep up with the needs of this fast-growing urban area. A facility like this would fill the missing gaps and help take the pressure off local families. When your child is sick the last thing you want to be doing is travelling great distances just to get basic health services. You would think that there could be no room for disagreement on such crucial needs in growing communities. You could assume that this would be a great example of something where bipartisanship could happen, with commitments from both sides of politics guaranteeing confidence and security for these towns and neighbourhoods. You'd be wrong. Not only was there not a single dollar committed to any of these projects, there was nothing committed to McEwen at all, full stop.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps even more galling, even more of a thumbed nose to the north of Victoria, was the 'too little, too late' strategy of my opposition candidate, who, once there was zero obligation, zero responsibility and zero win for him, came out and endorsed the projects that we put forward. If that doesn't take the cake, I don't know what does.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at infrastructure, the worst offender, the most egregious example of this government's thinking, is our infrastructure needs. Like much of the rest of the government's platform, its infrastructure policy is threadbare and is absolutely pork-barrel political. What else can explain why the state of Victoria, which contains 25 per cent of our population, has received less than eight per cent of federal funding for infrastructure under the failed Abbott and Turnbull governments and now this one?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Areas of regional Victoria, especially those like my electorate, are bursting at the seams with an influx of residents escaping unaffordable city house prices, but instead of being met with infrastructure ready for the future they are met with congested roads and paltry federal investment in public transport. Victoria has had and continues to get a dud deal from this failed Liberal-National government. Particularly urgent are projects such as the diamond interchange at the Hume Freeway, Watson Street upgrades and the Northern Highway duplication. Throughout the election, constituents reported to me that this was one of the key gripes they had with local infrastructure. Clearly, when you're getting traffic jams almost daily on a freeway something is wrong. We campaigned on this issue at the last election and we will continue to do so. Only last week, at the Wallan market, I launched a petition calling on the federal government and the state government to come to the table and fix this problem once and for all.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to have the interchange on the Hume. The federal government could do that today. They talk about a $100 billion pipeline of investment, but not one cent is being spent. We need Watson Street upgraded. We need the Northern Highway duplicated from the Hume Freeway through to Wallan to remove the traffic bank-up on the Hume Highway. We know what we need is for the federal government to join the Victorian government to get these things done.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Each and every year we get another Prime Minister roll through this failing government, and an ever revolving door of ministers of communication, and yet we are still dealing with the inept approach of this government to deliver a reliable and quality National Broadband Network, and their inept approach at addressing the serious risk to communities like mine during fire and other emergencies through funding the Black Spot Program. We shouldn't be surprised, and it doesn't make it any less galling, that the government has put more into its own pork-barrelling exercises, like it did in round three of the black spot funding, than actually going out and standing by its own criteria for rural and regional major transport hubs prone to natural disaster.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">You will remember, Deputy Speaker, my electorate was impacted. Ninety per cent of the Black Saturday bushfires were in our electorate. Yet 1½ towers was all this government was prepared to do, while it went down to save the seat for the member of New England and put 28 towers in his electorate—an area that does not meet the government's own criteria. But that's what this government's become, something that just pork barrels its way through, in secret, to the Australian people and continues on its merry way without giving consideration for Australians and their families.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As with commitments on road, health and education, I would welcome the government matching Labor's commitment on mobile black spot funding. Across the Macedon Ranges Shire, Mitchell Shire and City of Whittlesea we have number of locations with poor and non-existent mobile communications, including those in Bullengarook, Gisborne South, High Camp, Mount Macedon and Woodstock. These are known and proven bushfire-prone areas. More than most they require this constant coverage for updates on conditions in essential fire alerts. Two million dollars is a very, very small investment to pay for coverage that could quite literally save lives. But with the summers getting longer and heatwaves getting hotter, they need to act now if we are to divert a possible crisis. The government, instead of pork-barrelling its own seats, should address genuine and serious safety concerns.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this is the same government that promised every single Australian home would be connected to the NBN by the end of 2016, but here we are 2½ years past that and over 1.6 million homes still do not have access to high-speed broadband. What are they saying to the elderly in the community who are left without phones because of the dodgy NBN? Or to small businesses, those whose story I raised just recently in this place, losing half of an income stream because of inept installation, blame games and obfuscation by a pathetic minister. This and so many other rollout problems is why Labor took such a considered, detailed NBN policy to the election. Solutions like having qualified technicians being made available to address problems at no cost to the household if a premise was identified as having an in-home wiring problem. This plan would have provided the option for technicians to conduct a health check on in-home equipment, such as modems, which would bring good benefits to the consumers—things that would actually make a difference, a practical difference, to people's lives in this digital age.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What are they saying about the countless mobile phone black spots in McEwen that mean we don't have access to basic needs and emergency services? Absolute silence. I'm sick of the promises time and time again being delayed and changed, jeopardising small businesses and impacting daily lives of people in our towns and communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We have communities that are still unable to access the services they previously relied on because of a promised NBN that they haven't seen and certainly can't use. If we look at Malcolm Turnbull I think his legacy to this parliament will be two things: chaos and destroying Australia's opportunity to have a proper, 21st century, modern, fast, reliable broadband. Of all of this, we sacrificed the plan of full fibre-to-the-premises NBN, which even now the government knows is not working. The fibre to the node doesn't work. Now they're going to fibre to the kerb. Just put your pride away for two minutes. Deliver it to the home. Do the right thing by Australian people, not yourselves. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS is another very important reform that was established by the Gillard Labor government. Its purpose was to give every Australian living with disability the chance to live a good, proper life. Trial schemes were launched in most states, including the state of Victoria, and were positively received. Then the coalition government came into power and, over the course of six years, what started out as teething issues has snowballed into a total mismanagement of the NDIS. Yesterday in parliament we saw the minister stand up and say: 'Nothing to see here. Everything's fine.' If it's so fine, why have we got staffing shortages? Why do we have people coming into our offices each and every day crying because they have to keep telling their stories over and over and over again because the people in charge change and because they can't get access to basic needs and services? It's done this because the government chose to hoodwink the Australian people with that empty promise, that absolute lie, that the budget was back in surplus. It did that at the expense of disabled people's dignity and lives, and it did that at the expense of the mental health of people who have family members with disability. I don't think you can get any lower than using people with disability as a pawn to try to pump up your budget surplus. I think that's appalling, and I think most people understand that and see that.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about the budget? The government stood up here before the election, each and every day, and the Treasurer and the Prime Minister said, 'The budget's back in black.' It isn't; it never was. Go back to 2013 and think about old 'Sloppy' Joe Hockey. He stood here, in May 2013, and said, 'We will deliver a surplus in our first year of government and each and every year after.' No-one thought that anyone could be any worse than Joe Hockey as Treasurer, but then along came the member for Cook and now we have the member—I don't remember what his seat name is, but he's the current Treasurer, Mr Frydenberg. None of those three treasurers—Liberal treasurers; proud liberal free marketeers—have delivered a surplus. Not one of them. We find out after the election that it didn't happen. Despite taking all that money away from disabled people, they still couldn't deliver a surplus—and yet the Nats have the audacity to say that Senator McKenzie couldn't deliver a party in a pub.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen from this government is absolute failure on delivery, absolute failure on honesty and absolute failure on truth. They sit here day in, day out and constantly remind us how bad they are with their secrecy and their untruths. I mean, we've seen Senate estimates turned into a joke. We can't get questions on health answered. We can't get questions on NDIS answered. We can't get questions on security answered. All these things combined together have made Australia a worse place than it was before the election.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The mismanagement is creating bottlenecks in public hospital beds, with people who should be out of hospital straining our public health system because they can't get the support they need. This is an inefficient use of a government. Stressed-out doctors and nurses should be focusing their energy on pressing cases, not worrying about whether someone has support when they get home. You should always value a society by how it treats the most vulnerable. Clearly, what we have opposite are people who do not have respect for people who are vulnerable, do not have respect for people doing it tough. 'If you have a go, you'll get a go' was the mantra. What we've seen day in, day out from this government is people who are having a go, who are trying their guts out and who are getting stomped on by a government that has no interest in their future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to stand up here and fight for the people of McEwen and for the services that are so important to them. I do not take lightly the responsibility, the honour and the opportunity given to me, once again, to be a strong voice for them in parliament. This Liberal-National failure of a government keeps looking for ways to cut, but the cost they are willing to pay is to come off the backs of working communities. It's achieved through the slashing of services, through gutting vital agencies just for the appearance of a surplus. What they never ever acknowledge are the true impacts. They refuse to see that these numbers translate into people; they refuse to see the pain that's felt by every single Australian. Labor will not stop putting those people at the centre of everything we do and the values that we have. That was our election promise. It's the bedrock of the values of the Labor Party, and it's something that I and my colleagues stand firmly behind.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The government may have hoodwinked Australians into voting for them at the last election through campaigns of lies and smears from people like Clive Palmer, but the Australian people woke up very quickly after the election to realise that this is a show bag government: it's very expensive, it costs you a lot and when you get home you find it is full of nothing but rubbish and crap. We will continue to keep fighting to stand up to get the benefits our communities need and to make sure that we look after the people who need our support the most. That is what we are here for.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="218019" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  Madam Deputy Speaker Bird, there are 151 of us in the House of Representatives, and I know you would agree that we are all very humbled that we have the great honour and privilege of representing our communities in this place, and the job that we do is very important. We represent our communities and advocate for things that our communities want and need. Also, as members of political parties in government or opposition, we set the direction, the agenda and the focus that we need as a country to maintain the wonderful tradition that we are following. A lot of people, even Australians, like to run us down, but we are one of the freest, most prosperous countries in the world. That is because of the people that have come before us, people in this building that have set great parameters and great focuses for the lives of ordinary and normal Australians to get on with their job and, as we say, for those that have a go to get a go. It is very important that we set rules around the fact that, if people are out there trying to do the best they can in this country, they get rewarded. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly I want to thank my community of Page, which is on the north coast of New South Wales. Madam Deputy Speaker, you probably think this of your electorate, but mine is the most beautiful part of this country. It takes in the northern beaches of Coffs Harbour; goes into the Clarence Valley, with Yamba, Iluka, Grafton; up to the Richmond Valley, with Casino, Evans Head; into the Ballina shire, with Alstonville and Wollongbar; Lismore and all its villages; over to Kyogle; and up to Woodenbong on the border. It is a very beautiful part of the world and a very productive part of the world as well. We have a great exporting section of our community. We have wonderful industries like beef, dairy, blueberries, macadamias and much more. We have a great university as well. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank my community. At the recent election, I had a swing of over seven per cent towards me, and the margin in Page went from 2.3 to 9½ per cent. I'm very grateful to the community for again, for the third time, bestowing their faith and trust in me. It's not a job I take lightly. It's a job that I do very seriously and I'm very grateful every day that I wake up that I have the honour to represent our community. I want to talk about some of the things I'm going to be looking to do and to deliver over the next three years in this term of government, or things that have been completed in the last term of government. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When I'm out and about in the community that I live in, people always talk to me about jobs. They want job security. They want job opportunities for their children so that, if they don't wish to leave the area when they finish school, they have as many job opportunities as they can. Since being elected in 2013, this government has created 1.4 million jobs across the country, which has been a great achievement. In my electorate we're co-investing with Norco dairy co-operative in a $30 million upgrade of their ice-cream factory in Lismore, which I'm very excited about. Over 200 dairy farmers supply milk to Norco. They employ hundreds upon hundreds of people in the processing plant. This is a really important upgrade of their ice-cream factory and will secure demand for milk from the dairy farmers and provide job security for all the people that work in the processing plant. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We're looking to invest nearly $5 million in Lismore Airport for a new ILS. Again, all these things are job focused. Lismore City Council will be looking to bring in pilot training schools, and a lot of other things will be able to be operated from the airport. Negotiations are already in train for the industrial estate around the airport— more job-creating activity. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We have done a lot of sporting upgrades too. A lot of people say, 'Oh, sporting upgrades,' but I don't think some people appreciate the importance of that type of infrastructure in towns. Not only is it obviously good for our local kids, local adults and all of us who might play different sports around the place; it's important economically because you can attract state and, indeed, international types of activities to your town and to your region when you upgrade these facilities. We have many in many centres around my region and, when you're having a big carnival or a big activity like that, all the motels are full, the restaurants are full, the cafes are full during the day and the evening when those things are on, which is an important economic driver as well—one that I'm very much looking forward to with the state government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the next three years, we are going to be doing a $14 million upgrade of the Oakes-Crozier facility set up in Lismore. Nearly all sports are played there. They'll be playing cricket there along with rugby, league, soccer and Aussie rules as well. So it is going to be a great upgrade of that wonderful facility in Lismore. As I said, we're expecting that that will be creating an additional 20,000 tourists to our city every year, bringing extra millions of dollars to our local economy. To add to that: we've also already done some significant upgrades with sporting resources in Lismore. Lismore has produced some amazing baseballers over many decades. It is a very popular sport in our town, and we did a multimillion-dollar upgrade of that and already have attracted significant tournaments and carnivals because of that. We also updated the Far North Coast Hockey centre and since then have had three to four national tournaments. We had a seniors tournament there and then recently we had an under-21s tournament. It was great to see some of our local kids—anyone under 30 I call a kid!—play in the under-21s tournament in our local town. Again, all the restaurants and everything were full for the two weeks they were on.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the exciting things happening in Casino—again, job-focused—include me giving a grant to the meatworks there. They want to upgrade. I don't know if anyone is aware of this even in our region, but the importance of the meatworks is that they employ 1,200 people. If you are employing 1,200 people as a private-sector business, you are a significant business everywhere. They're very important not just to Casino but to the wider region. We have given them a grant to help with a new stripper, which is going to increase their productivity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the road, which obviously complements that business, we have invested again with the state government. We went halves. We invested $14 million in the saleyards there, which means it has one of the best, if not the best, cattle saleyards across the country across the road. Again, it's important because it's a job-focused grant.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I'm looking forward to there is that we have an application put in for a medicinal cannabis facility near Casino. We have given them a grant as well. When they go through the final approval through the Office of Drug Control, their plan is to employ over 200 full-time workers in that facility. It is a new business and new industry and is very exciting. I was very happy to help them out as well.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We also made a commitment to a tourist thing there—the Rail Trail—so from Murwillumbah to Casino there are some very exciting proposals. At the moment it's just covered by weeds, and we're looking to develop that into a tourism facility, which I think will be an exciting thing as well. Just recently I opened the drill hall there, which was a very important cultural and heritage thing in Casino which we've redeveloped with the council. This is an exciting thing happening in Casino. It has an amphitheatre and tourist information centre as well.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Kyogle is a wonderful part of the world. The local shire is a very beautiful area. They came to me a number of years ago with an infrastructure backlog of wooden bridges. They have over 300 of them, and it's a massive undertaking to repair them. A lot of them were built at the same time, so they're wearing out at the same time. Over the last number of years, we've been working together and have replaced many of them, and in the election campaign I made a commitment to keep fixing more of them as well.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This is very unusual: the federal government often gives money to aged-care providers by funding the cost of a bed in an aged-care facility—we'll give them the money to staff it and maintain the aged-care facility. We very rarely give money to a corporation or an organisation to build the aged-care facility. But the figures didn't quite add up for the aged-care provider in Kyogle to be able to provide that service unless we helped out. It was wonderful to help the Whiddon Group physically build and increase the aged-care facilities that they provide there.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of other things have happened in Kyogle over recent years as well. There was $1 million for sealing the Toonumbar Dam Road and the Culmaran Creek Road. We've also given them some extra money to help seal the Clarence Way, which is an important link. And very exciting things are happening out around Tabulam. It has a very large blueberry industry burgeoning out there, and, again, it's supplying jobs in our region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, it was wonderful to commit over $6 million to Summerland House Farm. This is a disability service provider in Alstonville, in the Ballina local government area. This is all about providing employment opportunities to disability workers. Summerland House Farm has done great things in tourism—and not just in tourism but for locals to go out there and enjoy the farm as well. It has shops, cafes and the restaurant; it's a wonderful place to hang out and, very importantly, it provides jobs for our disability workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Going further south into the Clarence and Grafton: in case everyone has forgotten, they might want to come up in the next week or two as we've got the Grafton Jacaranda Festival, always a highlight of the year in Grafton. It was wonderful to commit to a $6½ million riverside precinct upgrade in Grafton. The Clarence River is seriously one of the most—no, not one of the most, it's the most—beautiful rivers in our country; it's picturesque. It's called 'the mighty Clarence' and we don't call it the mighty Clarence for nothing, because it's got a lot of power to it. It's physically beautiful and it's going to transform Grafton with what we're going to be able to do and how we're going to be able to enjoy the river. That plan has been in place for years, so it was wonderful to commit to do that with the Clarence Valley Council. I'm looking forward to that transforming the riverfront.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The enjoyment there will increase tourism; it will be a destination to come to to experience all that. It adds onto a commitment I made a number of years ago to a riverside precinct upgrade down the river a little way in Maclean. Stage 2 of that has been completed now, again, turning Maclean around to face the river and enjoy the beautiful Clarence that it is, and increasing visitor experience in our region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This adds to the large commitment I made to the Harwood sugar mill in the last few years to increase their logistic capabilities and to improve their efficiencies, thereby improving and lowering their costs to maintain their competitiveness in the sugar industry. It was great to make that commitment of $4 million a number of years ago. The logistics have been improved. Again, why did we do that? Because we want to ensure the job security of people across the wider sugar industry, which is very important.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other amazing infrastructure programs in the Clarence Valley, and I won't go through them all because I'll run out of time. But the Pacific Highway goes through the Clarence Valley, and the Woolgoolga to Ballina section, which encompasses the length of Page, is happening right now. There are something like 3½ thousand workers working directly on that upgrade. We're doing that primarily to save lives—the fatalities on that highway are now at multidecade lows—but any fatality is a tragedy. Indeed, we had the 30th anniversary just last weekend of the disaster that was the Cowper bus tragedy, where over 20 people were killed on that section of the highway. That's why we're doing the duplication but, obviously, as an aside to that there is a lot of job creation activity happening there as well. The Harwood Bridge is almost complete; it cost $250 million itself. So that's been a great economic boost to the region as well.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I missed one—I'll just go back to the bitumen, in Casino. While talking about the riverside precinct upgrades at Grafton and Maclean, we also did one at Woodburn. At the moment people on the highway drive through Woodburn. Woodburn is going to be bypassed, so with the Richmond Valley Council we upgraded the Woodburn riverside precinct and it's absolutely beautiful. We want people to see it before the highway bypassed it, so Woodburn is going to become a destination in itself as well.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Down to the northern beaches of Coffs where, again, physically it's an absolutely beautiful part of our country, it's great because we're going to be opening a new surf club house there soon. The old one was, literally, nearly falling over. This $3.5 million new surf club house is about to open. It'll be a great facility for Woolgoolga and the northern beaches.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in the election I committed to building a whale trail, a walk where you can do whale watching. It's going to link the surf club right up to the headland. It's going to be a beautiful walk and great for tourism. We want people to keep visiting our beautiful region. The tourism industry is very important in the northern beaches of Coffs, and indeed my own area, because everyone wants to come for a holiday where we live. In fact, I holiday half an hour from where I live, because why would I want to go anywhere else? But that's another story. There are a lot of other upgrades as well, like Ken Leesen Oval in Iluka and many more, but I won't go through them all.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We're back to some people that I want to thank. Any one of us 150 people who are lucky enough to be in this chamber to represent our communities have had the opportunity, and requirement, to go through an election campaign. Some people would find them more enjoyable than others, but they're a very important part of what we do. We're all out in our communities every day and every week of the year. But certainly through election campaigns, it's more heightened and obviously people are much more tuned in to what we're doing. I had a wonderful team. There were 100 polling booths—it's just shy of that, but let's call it 100 polling booths—around Page, so I had hundreds of people, like we all did, out helping on election day. But, more importantly than that, through prepoll I had six prepoll booths which many people were manning for me, in some cases for over three weeks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge a young team of helpers I had. They were an inspiration to me. They were a group of about 16- to 20-year-olds, some of whom had been with me for a couple of years. We doorknocked, basically, the electorate, and we rung the electorate twice as well. It was great for me. There was great feedback for me and it was great to be in tune with the community about what was important to the community and what people were looking at. I want to name some of these people because of the contribution they made. I want to acknowledge: Jay Gibson on my staff, who led the team with Dave Smith; Eli Coleman; Matt Marchant; Brendan Pearce; Noah Coleman—congratulations too, on your two goals in the grand final; Sarah Venn; Dylan Butcher; Ruby Dardengo; Jed Lisetto; Oscar Stahl; Cooper Manning; Mark Sollom; Maya Layton; Max Condon-Hunisett; Lee Pagotto; Sophie Thompson; Brylea Linch; Elise Hatchman; Nick Albertini; and Emily Adams. I really want to thank that team. They were crucial for me. They were a great support for me on prepoll and, as I said, for the two years approaching that time as well. I have here many names of people who helped out on prepoll and the election day, but I'm not going to read them out—and I can see the member for Bendigo being very grateful for that.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, but just as importantly, I want to thank my staff, some of whom have been with me for the six years I've been here: Peter Weekes, Jay Gibson, Mark Highfield, Samantha Elley, Sheree Barnsley and Jason Thompson and their families. When you work in an office like an electorate office or for an MP, as you would know, Madam Deputy Speaker Bird, everyone's families are involved in the operation. I want to thank all of them, who make great sacrifices and were very supportive of me.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I want to thank my family. I've heard it said a number of times and it's very true, when they call us, the MPs, the volunteers. We volunteer for these roles, and our families are the conscripts; they come with us whether they have chosen to or not. I have the best team of conscripts you could ever wish to have. To my children, Bridget, Sean and Rosie—we have been on this journey together with me in this role for six years now. They've been a wonderful support to me. I'm very proud of them. They come out and do what they do, and just by the very fact they are the people they are helps me in this role, because they're good kids. They're good young people, and I'm proud of them. My wife, Karen, has been on this journey too. She is by my side literally every day, especially on weekends. Physically, we do a lot in this role together. I couldn't do without her, and I thank her very much.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  I thank very much the whips on the Labor team and the speakers whom I've jumped ahead of for allowing me to give my address-in-reply today. This is my last week in parliament before I go on maternity leave, so I do thank them for being generous in allowing me to leap ahead.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start with the election itself and I want to acknowledge all of the great supporters that we have in the Bendigo electorate and the people who put in such an effort. Yes, there are 151 of us here, but we represent a very broad network of people who really believe in our democracy. Regardless of party, regardless of politics, there are the true believers in all of our parties—the party faithful who really help get behind us to support the ideas and values. The Bendigo electorate has some of the most active branches across the region, and I want to pay tribute to and thank all of the Bendigo Labor branches: Bendigo South, Bendigo, Castlemaine, Kyneton and Woodend.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to give a shout-out to Pauline Brown, our president in Woodend, and Eric Dearricott and Marg Dearricott, our president and secretary in Kyneton. The Bendigo electorate is a large electorate, and they have consistently helped to run our show in the south, making sure that we have not just our polling booth staffed but our prepoll staffed and making sure that we are doing our doorknocking, our street stalls and our letterboxing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the great efforts of the Castlemaine branch and, in particular, Debbie Lawn. We have had three prepolls in our electorate this year, the first in Castlemaine, and we had probably the best result we've ever had at a prepolling station in Castlemaine. Every time I turned up, there were at least four of us there, and it wasn't until the last week that we actually had some opposition. So we felt pretty good about our coverage and the conversations that we were having with voters in Castlemaine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In Bendigo, I want to give a particular shout-out to the many volunteers who helped staff the prepoll and on polling day and also did the phone calling and the doorknocking, as well as the letterboxing. I want to make particular mention of my campaign manager, Kate Sutherland. She is the office manager in our team and took time out to help run the campaign. These are the fantastic people in our office who really pulled it together to make sure that we had our strongest foot forward.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We had volunteers and the coordinators of our volunteers, and what I was really proud of was the fact that the people in Labor in Bendigo do it because they believe in it. They believe in Labor; they believe in our purpose. We have a strong campaign team and we've built a very strong brand in Bendigo Labor. I acknowledge our fabulous state MPs, Maree Edwards, Jacinta Allan and Mary-Anne Thomas, who are part of the campaign team as well. We do have a bit of a lock on the region, and, working closely together as a team, we work hard there to ensure that we're representing the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make particular mention of my friend Michael Grimes, who passed away this morning. He has always been such a warrior and an advocate for the people of Maldon and for the Labor cause. Even though he was starting to get quite ill, he was still very active in the campaign. Joanna Casey, who is sick at the moment, has done our mobile booths in the south of the electorate for years. This time she took on a trainee, a mentee, because, as she said at the time, she didn't think she'd be around for the next election. I hope she holds on, but I know she is very unwell. I'd like to give her and her family my best wishes. These are real people in real communities who believe in something and make me very proud to be their elected representative and a Labor representative.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, though, when we turned up at a number of the polling booths on election day, not all the people there were volunteers. The Liberal Party had taken the unprecedented step of paying people to hand out how-to-vote cards. It was the first time we'd seen that in our area. Bendigo is a marginal seat; it's a swing electorate. In 2013, the margin dropped to 51 per cent. We just held on; it was a tough election. When you go from that election in 2013 to the election 2019, where the Liberal Party engaged a labour hire agency and paid people to hand out how-to-vote cards, you start to question whether people in our region support their values. And people don't. The results in Bendigo really reflect that.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">They were not the only ones. We had a number of candidates who put their hand up at this election for the Clive Palmer party, the Pauline Hanson party or the Fraser Anning party. We had a number of candidates to the right of us who were all working closely together and, on election day, paying people to hand out how-to-vote cards. It's a step in our democracy that I think we should be worried about—that we pay people to hand out party material. It is less about the values, the ideas and that broader social movement and more about who has money. We saw that play out in a number of areas. Whilst parties are still doing their reviews and there is some work for the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to do, I believe that all Australians should be worried that individuals can spend $60 million on an election campaign to have an influence. Money entered this federal election campaign like no other, and it did have an influence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I also believe we really need to focus on the role of social media and the impact that it is having on our politics, not just in election campaigns but all year round. Some call it fake news, some call it misinformation, but the problem is that, when a lie, or misleading information, is identified on Facebook, all they do is cop a complaint. They are not bound, and have not been bound, to take down that misleading information. If it were in a newspaper, in print, or on TV, there would be avenues for candidates and political parties to pursue that misleading information. Truth in advertising does occur in the mainstream media. There is a process. Sure, it could be strengthened, but there is a process. But the same does not exist for social media engines. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">So I hope that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters really looks into the role of social media and the impact that misinformation, fake news, fake campaigning and, quite frankly, lies are having. That's not just the impact they have had on our side of politics but the impact on all sides of politics. We do not want to be a parliament that is elected because of the amount of money an individual or business interest may have. We need to be a parliament that is elected through a genuine debate of ideas, a contest of values, and people who get out there to do the grassroots campaigning and say, 'This is our vision and our plan for Australia.'</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to really thank the people of Bendigo electorate. We ran a tough campaign and we worked hard. We are really proud of the network that we have in Bendigo, not just the Labor network but Labor supporters, our like-minded people. Thank you for returning me again to be your representative here in this parliament, for the third time and on an increased majority. We are at 59 per cent, which is a high-water mark for Labor in Bendigo, similar to the result that we got in 2010.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason why I raise that is not to crow but to talk about why it is we had a positive result. It is because we had a plan. Labor had a plan for Bendigo, and we were honest about that plan. We made commitments towards community infrastructure projects that people in the region really wanted to see: funding towards the airport terminal upgrade, to ensure that we could have more flights coming in and out of Bendigo; funding for the rail trail between Daylesford and Hanging Rock, a great tourism infrastructure project for the south; and funding to help Castlemaine District Community Health to find a new home, to build a new home, to ensure that they have a place in the new Castlemaine health and wellbeing precinct. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We committed funding to help our councils build footpaths, to fill the gaps that exist. Some may not realise it, but in areas like Bendigo, where you've got new estates and old estates, sometimes what's missing is the footpath between those new and old estates. The new estate only requires the developers to build the footpaths inside the new estate, so we made a commitment towards helping local councils build those missing links. Even though footpaths are not a federal issue, it's an area where I believe federal government can play a role to help partner with local government to deliver that vital community infrastructure. Just like we have Roads to Recovery and bridges to recovery, we could have paths to recovery, to encourage people to be out and active, riding to school, riding to work, pushing strollers. We need paths where older people can feel safe when they're walking. We need to make sure that we're helping our councils fill in those missing links. In regional communities and regional town centres, there are a lot of those missing links. It's always devastating when someone walks over to talk to you at a listening post, and they've got their high-vis vest on so that they're not hit by a car, because there is no path for them to walk on. That happens a lot in our electorate, because of the nature of the growth that we've had and the expansion of Bendigo and our towns. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm hoping that these are the projects that this government will adopt. Unfortunately, this was the first election where the Liberal-National party did not commit any money to Bendigo: no projects; not a dollar. No community infrastructure projects were prioritised, despite the lobbying and campaigning of our local councils, of our Bendigo business group, Be.Bendigo, and of a number of other stakeholders. The Liberal Party committed zero to the electorate. Yet our electorate has a similar make-up and a similar demographic—okay, we don't have the Great Ocean Road—to Corangamite, where they committed billions. So you can accuse them of pork-barrelling to save marginal seats and of deprioritising regional Victoria, where we need our fair share of funding as well. Not one dollar was committed to Bendigo, and now we are engaged in a campaign to, hopefully, see this government adopt the plan for the electorate that we put forward on behalf of the community. The government has a chance to do so in the MYEFO budget coming up. They have a chance to do so by committing to those vital community infrastructure projects that I have outlined. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also projects that I haven't yet outlined that should be considered. They include funding for the La Trobe University Rural Road Trauma Research Hub. We have a road trauma research hub at Monash University, but it focuses mainly on metro roads. The idea behind this is to focus on rural roads. We know that, particularly in Victoria, the death toll is higher—fatalities are higher—on our rural roads. La Trobe identified the need to establish a research hub to look into this issue and to look into safety, and I encourage the government and the education minister to pick up that project.  </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I also encourage them to fund the Macedon Ranges sports hub. To hear that money is going to other electorates— and the government understands the importance of these centralised precincts—is a bit frustrating, because this project has been on the books for a while. It will support not just sports in my electorate of Bendigo but also many clubs and sports in the McEwen electorate. It will actually be based in the McEwen electorate. McEwen and Bendigo share the Macedon Ranges. We know the government, through questions in question time, understands the importance of these hubs. It would be great to see the funding flow to all regions that require it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I guess that leads me to the groundhog day experience of being back in parliament and back in opposition. So much of what we've seen already since this government was re-elected is same old, same old: old policies, old legislation and old bills that they tried to get through after the 2014 budget just keep coming up. It's like they've run out of ideas already, and we're only in the beginning of the term. The attacks on pensioners continue. Today, we're seeing more legislation that will cut pensioners' incomes, particularly for pensioners who may wish to travel overseas to see family—kicking them off the pension if they're overseas for more than six weeks. It's just unfair. These are people who have worked hard in Australia their whole lives. The government is targeting a demographic of our community who have moved here, established their lives here and worked hard here. These people may, in their twilight years, wish to travel to the country of their birth or to the country of their family, but are having to cut the trip short so that they're not kicked off the pension.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I guess it wouldn't be as concerning if we had decent investment in resources and the reversal of the funding cuts to Centrelink. Since they've been back, we've again seen this government attack people on Newstart, people who are looking for work. One in five people on Newstart are underemployed, meaning they can't get enough hours and so they rely on Newstart to subsidise their income. These aren't drug addicts or dole bludgers or any other name that the government wishes to throw at them; these are people who are working and who simply can't get enough hours in their industry. And that is growing: we have 1.9 million underemployed Australians in this country. It's the highest it has ever been, yet there is no plan from this government to fix that crisis of underemployment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">One in four people on Newstart are over the age of 55. If the government were serious about supporting people on Newstart, they'd meet with them and learn their stories; they'd meet people who had been employed full-time but, because of shutdowns in manufacturing or losing their jobs, haven't been able to find secure employment since. They'd meet people who were working in a profession that they physically could no longer do. I've met nurses, I've met construction workers, I've met cleaners who, after they reach the age of 55 or 60, might incur an injury and they can no longer continue in their occupation. Many have retrained and tried to get work in their new field, but the jobs don't exist. This government has done nothing to address the real issue of age discrimination when it comes to employment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has done nothing to support young people looking for work. They continue to tout their Youth Jobs PaTH program, the exploitative $4-an-hour internship. There's the Work for the Dole program, which evidence and inquiry after inquiry have proven is not a pathway to genuine work. What they have not done is strike a compact with industry about how to rebuild those entry-level jobs. Instead, what we see is more legislation attacking young people, and we've seen that in their proposal to trial drug-testing of Newstart and youth allowance recipients. Instead of engaging with young people to learn about the barriers they face and why they're not in work, this government goes straight for the political attack. It demonstrates that this government is all about rhetoric and impression and not about substance and real reform.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some massive challenges in Australia right now and we don't have the government who can take them on. The statistics that came out last week—that is, the fact that one in six children are living in poverty—should be the alarm bell, the wake-up call the government needs to get on with genuine, real and lasting reform. In some of our communities, in regional areas like Bendigo and some of our suburbs, it's 50 per cent of the children. The report went into that level of detail. Yet there is no plan from this government; no commitment, no outrage, no inquiry, no crisis meeting to tackle that issue. We also had the startling statistic that one in four women go without food, go without at least one meal a week so as to feed their children, yet this government hasn't had any genuine conversations about how we're going to tackle food insecurity and other challenges.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I've mentioned the challenges with underemployment; we have problems with long-term unemployment. The economy is not fair and is not delivering for all. It's time we had a government that stopped with the rhetoric and started the reform that's required to ensure that all people in our communities get a decent and fair go. I hope that the next election comes around quickly and that it's going to be a fair contest of ideas and a fair contest on the agendas and platforms, and that it's not skewed by who has the most dollars and who can run the biggest fear campaign on social media.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start off by acknowledging someone who passed away quite recently, Barbara Cummings. She was described in the <span style="font-style:italic;">NT News</span>, quoting Selena Uibo, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the Northern Territory, as 'a trailblazer for Aboriginal affairs in Australia and a powerful voice for our Stolen Generations'. I'm going to use, liberally, the words from the citation for the award of an honorary doctorate which Barbara Cummings received quite recently from the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education, in which they chronicle for us some of the details of her life. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">She was born in 1948 at the old Darwin Hospital at Myilly Point. She was separated from her mother at a very young age and was brought up at the infamous Retta Dixon Home. Her mother was herself a member of the stolen generations, being brought up in the Kahlin Compound. I want to speak about Barbara because I knew her quite well and she dedicated her life to service for her community and as an advocate for members of the stolen generations. She was, in all respects, a leader and, indeed, a national leader on these issues for people who were no longer young, but old, as she was, and for those who have passed as well; she was an advocate for those who were forcibly removed from their families. As the citation says, she made an outstanding contribution to the welfare of all people, especially the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't go through her life story, other than to say that the citation highlights a number of contributions that Barbara made to the welfare of Aboriginal people, including as a founding member of the Karu Aboriginal and Islander child care agency, which recruited Aboriginal foster parents and reunited children with their families; a founding member of the Danila Dilba Health Service, which is a very vibrant and important organisation still operating in the Northern Territory; a founding member of the Juninga aged-care facility; and a founding member of LinkUp, reuniting families. She was deputy chair of the ATSIC Yilli Rreung Regional Council. Most significantly in the context of advocacy for members of the stolen generations, she was a convenor of the Going Home Conference in Darwin in 1994, which was a defining moment in terms of raising the issues around the stolen generations, which were subsequently given quite important national prominence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">She was a significant voice in the early establishment of the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care, SNAICC—National Voice for our Children. She wrote a book in 1990: <span style="font-style:italic;">Take this child: From Kahlin Compound to the Retta Dixon Children's Home</span>. It is an important recognition of the issues that she was so, in a sense, bedevilled by but, most importantly, advocating for. She wanted people to actually see the impact of government policy on communities and families where children were forcibly taken away.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">She was a leader in every sense. In this citation, toward the end it says: 'Barbara has been able to uncover, document and disseminate the historical facts and societal attitudes of those times and demonstrate its intergenerational impact. At the same time, Barbara has championed the critical importance of healing for all of the people who have been traumatised, hurt and damaged by those past policies and actions.' She was a very important person in the context of the Northern Territory and a leader in advocacy for the stolen generations. She was focused on getting kids back to country, including, where it was required, being buried on country—back to their home. She was focused, as her life story tells us, on the wellbeing of Indigenous kids. She fought to prevent kids from being removed from their kin.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To our undying shame, we have yet to compensate members of the stolen generation, and it's something which we ought to be contemplating. I know it was a policy which we—that is, the Labor Party—took to the last election. I invite the government to adopt that policy and to ensure that there is a compensation scheme for surviving members of the stolen generation, remembering that too many have passed in tragic circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now go to the election. I think it's important that we note this important thing because of the messages in the Governor-General's speech about 'his government's intention', as it's described, to address issues of importance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In my electorate of Lingiari, over 42 per cent of my constituents are Aboriginal people, who live in very remote, isolated and disparate locations. You might know, Mr Deputy Speaker Zimmerman, that we had a couple of weeks of mobile polling to secure the rights of those people to have a vote and to exercise that vote in a formal way. There were 21 remote polling teams, who visited large and small communities, outstations and homelands. There were 16,000 votes picked up by those 21 mobile polling teams.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Significant from my perspective and the reason why it's important to note this is that over 75 per cent voted for me. In four of those mobile booths the ALP vote was over 90 per cent. And another 12 teams generated a vote of between 70 and 90 per cent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">That's important, and I acknowledge how important it is, but we need to know why people voted that way. They voted that way because they were very concerned about the direction of government policy and about the failure of the coalition government to address their needs not only in terms of service delivery but in needing better outcomes in infrastructure, for housing, and, most importantly, to address dysfunctional programs like CDP.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">During the course of the election campaign, as you would probably expect, Mr Deputy Speaker Zimmerman, I visited many of these communities to talk about what we were proposing and how we would address their concerns. Principal among the concerns which were expressed right across the Northern Territory was the issue of CDP. Also, significantly in the context of the discussions which are currently taking place—and we've heard from the minister responsible, Minister Wyatt—they were concerned that their voice was not being heard. It was that sense of the abolition of ATSIC and that there was no way for those in regional parts of this country to articulate their concerns or to have a role in decision-making. That's really very important.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst, for some, the idea of an event at Uluru which was of national significance was important, what was most important was that their voice be heard at a local and a regional level. And so it was very clear for us, advocating for support for the Uluru Statement from the Heart and discussing what participation in decision-making might look like, that coming from those discussions people wanted to be part of the decision-making process and wanted to be part of it at the local and regional levels. Their primary interest was making sure that their voices were understood and heard, bearing in mind the different contexts that operate right across this country. There is no uniform view, and there wouldn't be in any particular set of communities. But in regions, where it's possible to identify, people were very supportive of that approach. Indeed, they looked at us and said, 'What we would like is for you to mirror in some way the old ATSIC regional councils.' That was a really strong message which was given to me prior to the election campaign. It suited us, in a sense, because it fitted our policy position.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, there is the CDP. I don't know of a more—well, I do know—this policy has failed miserably. It was the key issue across the whole of the Northern Territory, the idea that we get rid of the existing Community Development Program, because it really isn't a community development program—it is not—and come up with something different, prospectively built around what might have been the old CDEP, which most people in this place would have no knowledge of. It was the old Community Development Employment Program, which was introduced in the mid-1970s.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as a matter of interest, it was introduced because Aboriginal people in communities across the Northern Territory said: 'We're sick of sit-down money. We don't want it. We want to make decisions about how money coming into our communities is spent and how people are employed.' Then a conservative government took the brave decision, and I think it was the correct decision, in the first instance to send the entitlements of a number of communities—I think that Barunga and Beswick were in it, and maybe Wave Hill or Kalkarindji—in bulk and allow them to distribute it in terms of their priorities and work. Out of that evolved the CDEP program under which people were paid the equivalent of part-time wages for part-time work at an award rate, with the work being prioritised and determined by the local community. So what would have been unemployment benefits in those days was transferred to the community as a CDEP payment with a top up of about 10 per cent or 15 per cent, in the first instance, to allow capacity to invest in infrastructure and some capital. Significantly, across the north of Australia, where this was introduced the policy in most communities was no work, no pay. If you didn't turn up to work on Monday for whatever job you were designated to do, on the following pay week, on the Friday if that was payday, you didn't get paid for the Monday unless you had a reason that was backed by a doctor's certificate or some other appropriate reason that was agreed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">These are basic principles. They don't exist with the current CDP program. What the community has been telling us is: 'We want you to develop a program like that. It may not be exactly the same, but the principal should be. Allow us to be decision-makers about how money is spent in our communities.' For example, at a place like Galiwinku, in north-east Arnhem Land, there are probably around 800 potential participants on CDP. Currently about 300 turn up. So there's a massive gap, 500, who are getting no income support—none. That creates enormous pressure, as you would imagine, on those communities. They're not turning up, because they've been breached, because the employment provider, the program provider has breached them. They've not turned up. The money that they would otherwise have got goes back to somewhere, not to them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What we would propose under the new CDP arrangement would be that that money would stay in the community and be used for things like wages top-up, which used to exist under the old CDEP. It would be an entirely rational thing to do. There was recently a survey. This government did a review of the work for the dole program: <span style="font-style:italic;">The many pathways of the Community Development Programme: summary report of community voices and stakeholder perspectives from eight communities</span>. Thirty-six per cent of participants said their communities were worse off under the scheme. This is the government's own survey. Of the 1,100 survey participants, 21 per cent felt their community was better off since the Community Development Program was introduced and 36 per cent said they were worse off. There are about 35,000 CDP participants, and 83 per cent are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. As a condition of income support, remote area participants must engage in up to 20 hours of work for the dole five days a week. The review found that Aboriginal CDP participants were three times more likely to be penalised for nonattendance and were penalised more often.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This report found that social problems have increased since the introduction of CDP, including an increase in break-ins to steal food, predominantly by children and young people. We know that the stores have recorded a fall in income. The population is rising. People are being breached, so they're getting no income. They can't spend it in the store, so people are not being fed properly, so health becomes an outcome—bad health outcomes. This is all related to poor government policy and a policy that's been implemented badly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We in this place have an opportunity. We've offered our hand across the chamber to work with the government in a bipartisan way on this and other issues. But, frankly, we need action. We need this program to be abolished, as the people who voted for me in such strong numbers wanted. I'm the voice for those people in this place. It needs to be heard. I don't stand here bashing my gums together because I just want to. I address the parliament in this case representing the solid views of those Aboriginal people across my electorate who have indicated what they desire, and the government just won't listen. Well, it's about time you did.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  I'd like to use my time in the chamber today to talk about the local needs in my part of regional Australia, in the electorate of Mayo. I'd like to talk firstly about Aldinga, Port Willunga and Sellicks Beach, which are recent additions to our Mayo community, and it's been an absolute pleasure to represent them here in this place since the election. These communities are the fastest-growing parts of the City of Onkaparinga, and by a wide margin. Partially as a result, there are major infrastructure deficits in the area, including but not limited to the lack of a modern sporting complex.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The demand for an integrated sporting facility is both strong and growing. The current site is in need of major redevelopment and is the home of Aldinga Football Club, Aldinga Bay Bowling Club, Aldinga Bay Croquet Club, Aldinga Bay Hockey Club, Aldinga Soccer Club—go, the Sharks! That's what they're known as; see, it's great that they've got me as their member!—equestrian clubs, Aldinga Cricket Club and Aldinga Netball Club. An upgrade has the scope of attracting not only more men's teams but also women's and junior teams. The planned Aldinga superschool is adjacent to the sporting complex and would also benefit greatly from properly improved facilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to take the opportunity to thank the local clubs for discussing their needs and plans with me. I will continue to advocate for much-needed federal funding to upgrade their community sporting facilities for the benefit of current and future generations of local residents in this fast-growing area. It's one of those challenges that we have, I think, right across Australia on the periphery, the edge, of metropolitan communities. We know that they are the fastest-growing communities in Australia and yet they're also the communities lacking the most infrastructure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to talk about a very important issue in my electorate, and it's where we have the resting place for the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Hobart</span>. My electorate encompasses some of the most beautiful coastline in South Australia, and one particularly scenic overlook, over Yankalilla Bay between Normanville and Wirrina Cove, is also a place of significance for Australia's maritime naval history. Called the HMAS Hobart<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>Lookout, this outcrop overlooks the final resting place of the naval destroyer the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Hobart</span>, which was scuttled in the bay in November 2002. The ship, nicknamed 'the Green Ghost' because of her reputation for stealth, is now a marine reserve and a popular ecotourism diving site. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the lookout is a memorial to the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Hobart </span>and those who served on the ship during her distinguished career. The destroyer was the first Royal Australian Navy combat ship deployed to fight in the Vietnam War, and it was part of the Royal Australian Navy disaster relief effort following Cyclone Tracy in Darwin in 1974. The memorial lookout features seating and interpretive signage detailing the history of the vessels that have carried the name HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Hobart</span>. It also features the destroyer's anchor, which points towards the final resting place of the ship.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But the SA branch of the HMAS Hobart Association would like to do something more there. I recently met with the association representative Stephen Lamb, who is determined to add Vietnam War memorial plaques for Ordinary Seaman Raymond John Butterworth and Chief Petty Officer Raymond Henry Hunt. The men were killed on duty on the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Hobart</span> during what later turned out to be a friendly-fire incident involving the United States Air Force off the east coast of North Vietnam on 17 June 1968. Unfortunately, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hobart</span> was one of several ships mistakenly attacked by US 7th Air Force jets on that night. The HMAS Hobart Association of Australia, South Australia branch, believes the stories of these two sailors and others injured in the missile attack should be told as part of the lookout memorial, and I agree. In addition to helping the association find appropriate grant programs, I've been advocating for the project with the federal government. Australians place considerable value on our memorials. They are important places to stop and reflect on the service and sacrifice of our Defence Force men and women. Adding plaques for Ordinary Seaman Butterworth and Chief Petty Officer Hunt would add to the collective story of the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Hobart</span>, a story that I think belongs to all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm keen to talk to you about another part of my beautiful electorate of Mayo. Again, it's a relatively new part of the electorate. It is the leafy suburb of Craigburn Farm. Situated 17 kilometres by road from the Adelaide CBD, its close proximity to the city makes it perfect for those wishing to be within easy distance of Adelaide but away from the hustle and bustle and surrounded by nature and wildlife. Craigburn Farm boasts an abundance of open green space, and a large proportion of families regularly enjoy outdoor leisure activities there. One outdoor area frequently enjoyed by local families is the Blackwood Park Boulevard playground, which has proven to be very popular and has made a significant contribution to the lifestyles of local families. Feedback from the community has highlighted the need for improved facilities at the playground, including the addition of toilets, a water fountain, a sheltered barbecue area, a bike stand with pump and tool station, a junior play area and improved walking and cycling paths. These facilities would positively support the existing playground and serve to attract even more local families of all ages, as well as visitors, to this much-valued outdoor space. A relatively small investment in this area would have a significant positive impact on the local community and would encourage more local residents to get outdoors and participate in a healthier lifestyle—a worthwhile investment in anyone's book.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">A long distance from Craigburn Farm is another part of my community that I'm sure the member for Bennelong, whom we have here, will take an interest in: the Woodchester tennis courts. The tennis courts in Woodchester form the community sporting hub in that close-knit community. The community-owned Woodchester Tennis Club courts are in dire need of resurfacing, as the current playing surface was laid back in 1991—a long time ago, I'm sure you would agree with me, Mr Deputy Speaker Zimmerman. The club currently has four senior teams playing in two competitions, and they have hopes to fill a junior team in the near future. Because the courts adjoin the Woodchester hall, they are regularly used for community events such as the yearly Christmas party and CFS social days. The club has been working hard for many years to raise the funds to cover the expected resurfacing costs. It hosts biannual open-air quiz nights on the courts, and these are the major fundraisers for the Woodchester Tennis Club. The club has told me, 'We as a club believe it is vital for small communities such as ours to continue to keep these facilities operational for the benefit of future generations. As a club, we want to ensure that tennis continues to be played in small rural communities.' I could not agree more. As a former tennis player until I came into this place and could no longer spend my whole Saturday playing tennis—</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting">Mr Alexander interjecting</span>—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms SHARKIE:</span>
                </a>  I have played with the member for Bennelong. I'm not sure that I agree with his comments. But what I will say is that tennis on Saturday certainly brings a whole community together. As much as it's a sport and it's about keeping healthy, it's also very much part of our social fabric. I look forward to visiting the club at the end of the month to discuss their future plans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important tennis club in my community is the Gumeracha Tennis Club. If you've been to the Gumeracha Tennis Club and you've had a look at their courts, they really are at the point of being unplayable. They are full of cracks. They are really on the verge of being quite dangerous. The cracks are huge and, sadly, they are spreading. In community consultations over the Gumeracha oval and federation park master plan, fixing the courts was considered a very high priority by the Gumeracha community and by the local council. The Gumeracha Tennis Club have been active in pursuing funding opportunities, and have a clear and compelling vision for their club's future and the future of the facilities. I look forward to working with that club as well to advocate for much-needed assistance for resurfacing their courts. Across regional Australia, our sporting clubs are the paramount part of our towns; they're the part that keeps us together. Sporting clubs are the glue of our towns. And I really do look forward to working with government to ensure that these facilities are viable into the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many members in this chamber, I have a thriving network of Men's Sheds. There are thousands of Men's Sheds right across Australia and more than a dozen of those are in Mayo. In fact one of the very first Men's Sheds in the nation was established in Goolwa in 1992, through the Goolwa Heritage Club, by local woman Maxine Chaseling. I'm a huge supporter of these non-profit organisations that enhance the physical and mental health of men in a very local, hands-on way.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">One of Mayo's more recently established Men's Sheds is at Yankalilla. The membership is growing, and the group are always looking for ways to increase their footprint. Over homemade sausage rolls recently, the guys told me that blokes can never have a shed that is too big. In the meantime, the Yankalilla Men's Shed have come up with new ways to expand their equipment and facilities, recently building their own kitchen and meeting areas. And while they are handy with their hands, they do need some assistance in fitting out their kitchen, so I've been pleased to advocate to the government, on their behalf, to try to source grant funding to cover much needed items such as a hot-water service, a microwave, some crockery, tables and chairs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Aside from fitting out their kitchen, top of their list is a defibrillator. I was pleased to ask a question in this place to the Minister for Health about the defibrillator program. With most of the men at retirement age and in the high-risk group for cardiac arrest, they consider, as I think many Men's Sheds do, a defibrillator to be as essential as a fire extinguisher. In April this year, the federal government announced funding to equip every Men's Shed with a portable defibrillator, and the Yankalilla Men's Shed recently contacted me to find out when they would receive this life-saving device. As I mentioned, I raised this with Minister Greg Hunt, and I was pleased to be advised during question time that the program should be rolled out early in the new year. This is welcome news, along with the government's commitment to providing continued and expanded funding for the Men's Shed movement of $11.2 million over four years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year I invited the Minister for Veterans and Defence Personnel to Mayo to meet with the Macclesfield RSL, where we held a roundtable session with more than 50 veterans and their families, who also joined us for morning tea. At the conclusion of the event, and along with Mr Dennis Oldenhove, President of the Macclesfield RSL, I took the opportunity to show the minister the unique Anzac memorial garden that has been created by the local RSL. The memorial garden commemorates the sacrifices made by veterans while also providing the community with a space for quiet contemplation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The garden continues to grow in both scale and popularity, and it now requires a shelter to provide a protected space for visitors to the garden during inclement weather. The construction of such a shelter has the support of not only the RSL but also the Macclesfield Men's Shed and the Macclesfield Football Club. But instead of seeking financial assistance to purchase an off-the-shelf shed, these groups are going to roll up their sleeves and construct the shelter themselves. Both the Men's Shed and the football club will donate not only their time and expertise but also the funds to purchase a proportion of the materials. This project will provide an opportunity for mentorship, to give local residents the chance to get to know and better understand the ex-service personnel and the contributions they have made to our country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Notwithstanding the generous community spirit, this venture still requires a modest injection of funding from the government before the project can proceed. As we approach Remembrance Day, I think this investment would be both timely and worthwhile, a legacy for our veterans, and I hope that the government can recognise the value of such a project. I know that I certainly do. I would like to say that the ingenuity of the Macclesfield RSL is absolutely astounding. In every single thing they do they bring the community with them and I applaud them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The leading cause of death for young Australians aged between 16 and 24 is not car accidents, it's not alcohol fuelled violence and it's not cancer. It is suicide. I welcome the Prime Minister's appointment of Christine Morgan, who is the chief executive of the National Mental Health Commission, as Australia's National Suicide Prevention Adviser. I will work closely with the government to ensure our communities have the support they need.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the best supports in our community for young people is headspace. Headspace is often the first place that our families and young people turn to for support and advice, but demand for these services is high and the waiting lists are too long. I recently secured funding for two satellite offices in Mayo, one in Mount Barker and one at the other part of the electorate, on the mainland part of the electorate, in Victor Harbor. Since opening both services are stretched thin, providing outreach services to the surrounding areas of Strathalbyn and Kangaroo Island. The government must recognise the needs of the young people in the Adelaide Hills and the Fleurieu Peninsula. It's time that the satellite offices were converted to standalone headspace offices with the necessary resources and specialist staff required to address the needs of our community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also recently spent time with the young people in the Aldinga region. While the barriers preventing access to appropriate mental health care in rural and regional areas in South Australia , such as Aldinga, may be different to our more metropolitan counterparts the need is just as great. I've spent much time with the headspace, Onkaparinga, and I know that their organisation is ready and willing to provide a regular outreach service to the Aldinga area. I intend to work with the Minister for Health to see what options are available to see this come to fruition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Headspace is not a panacea. It will not fix all mental health issues for young people but it is certainly a start. We must do all we can to equip young people with the skills they need to navigate life. I am so fortunate. I'm sure everyone thinks that they represent the best part of Australia, but I'm quite sure that I definitely do represent the best part of Australia. I am, again, honoured. It is an absolute privilege to represent my community and continue to fight for everything we need. Thank you.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  It's been some five months now since the election, but in this address-in-reply to mark the start of the 46th Parliament I'd like to put on the record my sincere thanks to the people of Newcastle for their ongoing trust and faith in me as their elected representative. I am honoured and humbled to have the support of Novacastrians for a third term. It was incredibly heartening that they got behind the vision of a fairer society that leaves no-one behind. I promise to continue to be a fierce advocate for our city. Newcastle has a critical role to play and, indeed, much to gain from the inevitable transition to a low-carbon economy. I will continue to argue that we should have a key seat at the decision-making table to ensure that workers and communities like ours are not left behind. I will also be laser focused on mounting the case for a Newcastle container terminal to create jobs and help produce a more diverse economic base, both for our port and indeed the entire region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also pleased that Newcastle supported the $25 million worth of commitments that I made for our community, commitments that I was incredibly proud of having secured and would have been delivered by a Labor government. Of course it's very disappointing that Labor wasn't able to form government, especially given all the incredible benefits my community would have seen, but it doesn't seem right that the community has to pay the price. Today, I'd like to go through these commitments in detail, and I urge the government to match them. The people of Newcastle voted in good faith for these projects, and I truly believe their wishes should be respected. To this end, I've also written to individual ministers, outlining the benefits of these commitments, and called on them to listen to the strong endorsement from the people of Newcastle and to deliver these projects from government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The first project I'd like to discuss is the $3 million rebuild of the Boscawen Street Bridge in Wallsend, which is critical to protect against future flooding. While 12 years has passed since those terrible super storms that wrought a trail of destruction through Wallsend, residents and business owners still brace themselves every night when it rains hard. This project would resolve some serious flooding risks, drive business confidence in the region and bring peace of mind to the whole community. A number of issues have been identified with Boscawen, including the low clearance of the bridge, the handrails and the intermediate piers, which have a high chance of trapping cars, shopping trolleys and items that come down through the drain pipes causing massive blockages. To solve this, the bridge has to be reconstructed and it has to have those piers removed. We need to create a single span bridge which would improve the flow capacity in large flood events.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The second commitment was a fantastic cultural contribution of $350,000 to Atwea College to help create a music hub that would have given young Novocastrians access to professional equipment and the skills and experience they needed to pursue their musical ambitions. Life music has long been the lifeblood in Newcastle, but it's getting harder and harder for young people to find the space to hone their skills. The funding that Labor committed would have been used to create a rehearsal space, a live performance area and a recording studio at the Creative Arts Space on Beaumont Street in Hamilton. Atwea had also committed to provide professional musicians to offer mentoring, training and support for the next generation of artists and to connect them to Newcastle's thriving music community. I was very pleased to support this project, which would have provided training and support to nurture Newcastle's next generation of musical talent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in the area of education, I was pleased to commit $6 million to the University of Newcastle towards nine important equity and research projects. I'd like to put on record that the University of Newcastle is one of those regional universities that is deeply committed to producing not just excellence in their education but in equity of access and outcomes. It is those dual ambitions of equity and excellence that have always driven that university. That's why, in a region like ours, you are now seeing record numbers of children who are the first in their family to attend university and record numbers of First Nations men and women enrolling in university. We have now more than 1,000 First Nations students enrolled at the University of Newcastle, training more than 50 per cent of the nation's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander doctors and specialists. This is a record to be truly proud of. The enabling programs at the University of Newcastle, for which I have fought off attacks from the government on a number of occasions now, are the largest and oldest programs in the country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very fortunate, last Friday night, to attend a celebration for the 20th anniversary of the Yapug program. That's an enabling program aimed specifically at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. When I addressed the second-year medical students not that long ago, 19 of those students came through the Yapug program and were now in second-year medicine at The University of Newcastle. So we know these programs work; we know that the university deserves all the support it can indeed muster, because it is delivering both quality and excellence at every opportunity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Back to the projects that we were able to commit to, had Labor formed a government. We would have seen, as I said, $6 million injected into a number of critical projects. These projects included $2.4 million for two cutting-edge research projects that would have helped drive a clean energy future. These projects were designed to look at some of the most challenging problems facing the national energy grid and finding ways to get more renewable energy into the system. Newcastle has long been at the forefront of research to create smart energy, so it's perfectly placed to do the work and to drive the breakthroughs of the future. As I said, the energy smarts that we have that have driven our work in the coal industry for centuries are actually very applicable to a whole range of renewable energy projects as well.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We committed $450,000 for a three-year project to boost job outcomes for young people in the Newcastle and Hunter region. I'm sure everybody in this House agrees that getting work, particularly as a young person, is probably one of the most important post-education tasks that you can undertake. In its first year, this project would have seen up to 100 young people from across the Newcastle and Hunter region with intensive personalised support. Participants would have benefited from individual needs assessments undertaken by career experts and support to boost their skill sets and to develop the personal qualities that employers are looking for. They would also get help to create effective resumes and prepare themselves for interviews.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There was $580,000 for two projects to boost the number of young people participating in science, technology, engineering and maths. This included a $400,000 commitment for the university to extend the fantastic HunterWiSE Network, which is a collaborative network of women in STEM and focused on addressing low female participation rates in the sector for three years. It would have had focused attention on lifting the numbers of women entering into those STEM programs. HunterWiSE exists not just at the university; the program has a very important outreach component to it. An additional amount of funding would have supported the HunterWiSE Outreach Program, which is a 10-week intensive program that links girls in high schools across the region with female mentors working or studying in STEM sectors to tackle problems in their local community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen this in operation, and it's a most remarkable course. It asks young women to apply the skills that they're learning through STEM subjects to very real community problems. I had the pleasure of attending a graduation very recently, and I could not have been more proud to stand alongside some truly extraordinary young women who are feeling empowered by their knowledge and the access that they now have to some really terrific programs through the HunterWiSE Network.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a $1.65 million project to change community culture and to help people with an experience of domestic violence take up higher education. This project consisted of four complementary aspects which would have supported up to 1,400 participants from across the Newcastle, Hunter and Central Coast regions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Creativity and Learning Beyond Trauma is a program which aims at building confidence and introducing participants who have experienced family violence to study in the university environment through an arts based approach. There was another component called Choice, Change and Opportunity, which would have helped people who've, again, experienced domestic and family violence to engage with learning and education through tailor-made pathways. Students would have had a dedicated support person to navigate enrolment, assessment and other challenges of university life. And there was Supporting Students Beyond Domestic and Family Violence, which was a project that generated knowledge and strategies to address and overcome the different forms of violence affecting university students. Finally, there was the Challenging Gendered Inequalities Leadership Program, which would target high school students and raise awareness about the damaging impacts of gender inequality and provide the tools to challenge harmful attitudes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I think you would agree with me, Deputy Speaker Zimmerman, that projects that create sustainable pathways for students coming from violence and traumatic experiences are absolutely critical to ensuring that we have equity in our education program. Indeed, it's those students that you absolutely want to have access to a quality higher education to break those cycles in their lives. That's why I championed those projects before my shadow ministers at the time and was lucky to secure that funding. But there was also $750,000 for two projects to give disadvantaged people the skills and support they need to take up higher education. That included a $500,000 investment for the University of Newcastle to develop a self-paced national program designed to provide a taste of enabling programs to prospective students. I spoke about the terrific track record of enabling programs at the University of Newcastle, but we don't want to rest on our laurels here; this is an opportunity to actually expand those programs and take them out into regions and into high schools to enable students to get a taste of the kinds of opportunities and alternative pathways that are available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">A further $250,000 commitment would have supported a pilot program offering important time with staff and support for regional students at community centres in the Upper Hunter, the Central Coast and the Mid North Coast regions. Fifty thousand dollars was also on offer for two parents rooms at the University of Newcastle libraries. There was $120,000 for a project to open up university options to young people in out-of-home care. I don't need to remind people; I know that in this House the massive increase in children in out-of-home care demands that we start thinking about how those kids move into higher education. With about 10 per cent of young people in my area in out-of-home care, we have an extraordinarily high rate of children in the Hunter, Newcastle and Central Coast regions who are in out-of-home care. There is a dire need for greater support. I would have loved to have seen this program going ahead. These projects were designed by the university to meet the very specific needs of our region and they would have delivered significant community benefits. Obviously, I still strongly believe they are worthy of government support. As I said, I've reached out to individual ministers, asking them to, indeed, lend their support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But schools didn't miss out either, with an investment of $120,000 for priority projects at four public schools. The first of those was $50,000 to upgrade the basketball courts at Glendale public school. The second one was $25,000 towards digital media equipment for the annual Digital Media Festival at Callaghan College. There was $25,000 towards improvements at New Lambton Public School, including a new fence and softball areas. That's very important for a school that has no grass. Those softball surfaces are critical. There was $20,000 for Stockton Public School to create an outdoor learning play area and sensory garden. These much anticipated projects would have improved the amenity of these schools and improved educational outcomes. This announcement was on top of an extra $19.4 million that Newcastle's public schools would have received in the first three years of a Labor government. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The next project was $2.3 million to rejuvenate Throsby Creek and prevent damaging plastics and rubbish from ending up in the ocean. The funding would have allowed for the installation of four gross pollutant traps to catch rubbish at the source, so it doesn't end up in our precious oceans. It would have also provided some funds for landscaping on the northern bank of the creek between Lewis Street bridge and Hannell Street. Those improvements would have been much appreciated by the community, and were part of Labor's planned urban rivers and corridors program, which included $200 million to restore urban waterways and habitat corridors across the country to their natural beauty. I encourage the government to look at such a program for urban waterways and how critical this is. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's $62 million beaches and coastlines climate adaptation plan also would have offered important environmental benefits. Critically, it included a $50 million Coastal Rehabilitation Fund to help communities prepare for and respond to coastal erosion. As I've discussed many times in this House, there's a community in my electorate called Stockton, which is facing diabolical, existential threats from coastal erosion, and it would have been very well positioned to take advantage of this funding commitment. During the campaign, I met with Stockton residents and representatives of the community liaison group, highlighting the potential for this funding to support the work of the state and local governments in addressing the diabolical erosion issues that the community now faces. Since the election, the community has now lost its only childcare centre, and a number of other very important community assets are, literally, being sandbagged to prevent them from being swept into the ocean. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The next funding commitment was $491,000 to reverse the planned Morrison government cuts and to deliver an extra funding boost to emergency relief organisations operating out of Newcastle. Off the back of Anti-Poverty Week, where we saw the true extent and prevalence of poverty in our communities and the human face of poverty, this would have been a very welcome addition. I am truly sad that the Samaritans foundation and the Muloobinba Aboriginal Corporation have not benefited from the additional funds that they could have. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also another important regional announcement on our support for the Glendale interchange, and there are opportunities now for the government to really get onboard and see the value of important community projects—to back in things that would help share some of the prosperity of this nation and to ensure that those who are disadvantaged and marginalised in our communities are given a fair start and are given every chance to reap the benefits of being Australian citizens. </span>

                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker Zimmerman. What a delight it is to see you in the chair today. There has been a long tradition on election night that the incoming Prime Minister, having claimed victory or something approaching it, commits to govern for all Australians. The cynic in me says that this is the first lie of any incoming government; my fairer-minded side might simply note that the proof of the political pudding is forever in the eating. For my part, I've always hoped that an incoming government, be it Labor or coalition, would do its best to govern for all and not just some of us, and that it will have the good fortune also to try to honour the commitment to govern for all. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I know it sounds old-fashioned and it doesn't make for a particularly sharp political message, but, deep down, every one of us here wants the country to succeed, whoever is in charge and whoever gets the credit. It's something of a commentary on our times that one has to say that. We know also that success doesn't come easy. Good governments, and good oppositions, for that matter, take risks for which they are invariably judged with the benefit of hindsight, sometimes not always kindly. We know that change is hard to sell and the public isn't always keen on new policies or ideas or even facing up to issues that can't be resolved without creating losers as well as winners. Elections and a new parliament offer one of those rarest of political opportunities—a chance to wipe the slate clean and admit what's working and what isn't. My concern with this government is that, five months into its term, it shows little sign either of admitting that not everything is going well or of governing for all Australians. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Governor-General's speech, written for him to deliver by the government of the day, is the parliamentary set piece for a newly minted government to outline its plans for the next three years. It provides an early signal as to whether that important election night commitment to govern for all will be met or dodged. Better addresses to the opening of parliament provide a strong indication that the government both knows its own mind and has listened and learned from the election. Having a proper new-term agenda means more than just jotting down a shopping list of disconnected thoughts and ideas that might appeal to the interests or prejudices of its own political base. Government might call it a plan, but it's not. What is needed is a coherent suite of policies that will address the issues of the day and the more deeply-held concerns and aspirations of the Australian people. To remain credible, a Governor-General's address needs to be candid about the true state of the world and give recognition to what might have been done or gone better in the previous parliament. It's a chance to re-establish trust and one of the few chances our adversarial political framework has to offer. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly for me, and I think for many in the community, this government has yet to demonstrate that it has a clear agenda for this term of government or has learned much about the mood and the disposition of the Australian people. As you'd expect, I would not make that criticism of the great Whitlam government, the Hawke government or the first Rudd government. But I'd equally not make it of the second and third Howard governments either. Each of those two governments had solid plans for what they wanted to achieve and how they were going to get there. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">After a shambolic first term and a near loss in 1998, John Howard and his advisers worked out that there was more to governing than winning office and then hoping for the best. John Howard always had a next-term agenda. If you ask any senior public servant who was around at the time, they'll confirm that Howard always had a plan and a plan to follow. Menzies, in his near-election loss in 1961, as I think the much-respected Arthur Sinodinos may have recounted on the ABC on election night, recalibrated his government policies in part by lifting a number of ideas prosecuted by Labor and Arthur Calwell in the 1961 campaign. He'd recognised that he'd lost touch and needed to reinvent himself. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, the last three coalition governments have arrived ill-prepared for office, short on policy detail or fresh ideas. Unsurprisingly, each has been a captive of the daily news cycle and frequently drawn away from addressing the matters that most concern Australians. The Abbott government arrived rudderless, guided by not much more than a selection of empty slogans. It foolishly outsourced policy formulation to its National Commission of Audit then delivered to order a set of far Right political staples and pipedreams that, when translated into the horror 2014 budget, sealed the fate of the Prime Minister and his then Treasurer. The Turnbull government arrived with a rudder but with competing hands on the tiller and ended in policy paralysis. And we've seen little evidence over the last five months that the Morrison government is governing for all Australians or even knows where to start. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's signature tax policy has been bullied through the parliament. It will cost about $300 billion over 10 years and is already being used as an excuse for not funding improvements to important and underfunded government services and programs such as Newstart. Yes, tax cuts were particularly long overdue for those earning less than $80,000 a year, but they could have been more generous to those who were really struggling to get by while still offering something for everyone, and they did not need to be so heavily skewed to those who needed them the least.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As Ross Gittins neatly put it back in July:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consider the first actions of the re-elected Scott Morrison and his government. First, pushing through its three-stage tax plan, which in time will cut the income tax of those on the minimum wage by 1.5¢ in every dollar, those full-time workers on the median wage by 2.4¢ in every dollar, and those on $200,000 a year by 5.8¢ in the dollar.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, we've had a renewal of government attempts to stigmatise welfare recipients by fresh attempts to extend the reach of the cashless welfare card, drug testing for welfare recipients and the ongoing horrors of robo-debt, (1) punishing the most vulnerable and, (2) ignoring the evidence base for any of these policies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We've witnessed too the government's stony-faced glare in the general direction of the 700,000-plus Newstart recipients, the majority of whom are over 40 years of age, and who have been paying income tax and GST all their lives. They're being asked to eke out an existence on between $40 and $50 a day, or about $200 a week below the poverty line. If you have a family to support, or a mortgage to pay, Newstart is one of the stingiest unemployment benefits in the entire OECD. And I understand that now, and really for a long time, it's the turn of the refugees to cop another metaphorical beating from those opposite as the government attempts to repeal the medevac legislation over the objections of every medical group in the nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Like Paul Keating in 1993, Prime Minister Morrison can lay claim to winning a famous and unexpected election victory. There is no doubt about that. Paul Keating, though, is not simply remembered for an unlikely win, but as a primary agent of economic progress and social change—a national leader who made a difference and the antithesis of a political fence-sitter. All the current PM has proven today is that he can pick his moment and that his years in advertising weren't entirely wasted, given his expert marketing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In this Governor-General's speech, there is not even the remotest sense of a government with a vision for a fairer, safer and more competitive Australia, one that has plans and aspirations for the low-carbon future that the world will inevitably thrust upon us and which is not too far off. What the parliament was presented with was a hastily written shopping list of truisms that turn out at best to be only partly true. There were claims about the economy that invite ridicule, while ignoring reason and experience. It's a political bucket list, enlivened with only a general sense of confidence that, with luck, something might turn up.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Governor-General's speech is the chance for any newly minted government to outline a vision for our nation. It's not another excuse for a government to mark its own homework and give itself plenty of positive ticks, and relate to a complete exercise in self-justification. It's not a platform for de rigueur attacks on the usual suspects that the hard Right likes to attack, or for bathing in the stale waters of political hubris, which they have in a large amount—as evidenced by the Minister for Home Affairs and his performance in question time today.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">For one moment, imagine you're a hardworking nurse or a junior doctor in one of our underfunded and overcrowded public hospitals; or a harassed and underpaid aged-care worker; or a worker in child care; or a worker just off a long and gruelling shift in one of our mines or factories. How would you react to this Morrison-government-crafted gem from the Governor-General's address on 2 July:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our economic strength has been won by the enterprise, innovation and determination of a hardworking people, especially those running small and family businesses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Isn't every hardworking Australian who does their best for themselves and this country worthy of equal praise? Or is it just some groups or callings that are particularly special? I simply ask this: is this the perspective of a Prime Minister governing for all Australians?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">From what we've seen to date, this government is no more ready for office than it was 12 months ago, and no more willing or able to meet our national challenges than the failed Turnbull or Abbott administrations that preceded it. This is a government that didn't expect to win, and prepared accordingly. Why else would you call your own victory a miracle? It is at least as ill prepared for office as its two predecessors, without the luxury afforded them by a domestic economy in cruise mode and relatively benign conditions abroad. To borrow a phrase from Malcolm Turnbull, what we've had since the election is a government busily deploying weapons of mass distraction in the hope of providing a bit of political cover while it hastily cobbles together something vaguely approaching a second-term agenda.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a government playing for time that steadfastly refuses to tell it like it is on the economy. It's obsessed by one goal, and one goal only, that of securing the bragging rights of being the first federal government since the global financial crisis to deliver a budget surplus—that is, to take more money off taxpayers than it pays out—never mind that the consequences for economic activity of running a surplus may not be good, never mind that you've doubled the size of government debt while in office and never mind that your pie-in-the-sky 10-year tax plan will add further to government debt if your growth assumptions prove too optimistic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, the economy has been left to stumble along to the exasperation of the Reserve Bank, business and the community at large. Even the Business Council is arguing for an increase in Newstart. The promise of new infrastructure spending remains mostly that, just a promise, and an empty one at that. Government and private debt remain at record levels, unemployment is inching up and the first round of tax cuts seem to have done as little to stimulate economic growth as most commentators predicted they would. Consumer confidence also is on the skids. The level of Newstart payments and the robo-debt fiasco are even more demanding of action than ever before. Robo-debt must be the most conspicuous case of data mismatching since some genius first thought it was a great idea to start comparing apples with oranges. Robo-debt and government intransigence on Newstart each have the potential to further poison the well of public trust. Each could be addressed without placing undue strain on the public purse or threatening the integrity of our unravelling social security arrangements. Any deftness of touch in foreign affairs seems to have departed coalition politics together with the previous Prime Minister and his deputy. We seem to be taking every opportunity to offend our major trading partner while buddying up to a US administration about which the less said the better. We are in a second age of government by sound bites and slogans, perhaps a little better honed than under Prime Minister Abbott but no less pathetic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">With this government, the rhetoric says it is getting on with it while the reality says it is more about getting away with it. The one message for all sides of politics from the last election is that we all need to spend rather more time explaining ourselves and being more candid about things when things haven't gone as well as we'd hoped. Logic tells us that it's much better to correct early first steps than resolutely continue down the wrong path. The government would make a good start by ditching the absolute rubbish it talks on the state of the economy and the jobs market. If there is to be an improvement in our public discourse and a lift in public trust it's going to have to come from the top. The PM can be an excellent communicator—really, one of Australia's best in terms of the way he communicates—and it's well within his remit to have his ministers tell it a bit more like it is than as they wished it was, as Minister Stuart Robert was doing yesterday when he said there is no waiting list for the NDIS. The Treasurer could be more forthright too. It's just so painfully obvious the Treasurer's playing for time that he should just stop the ducking and weaving and admit what's going on. I've not been to the Treasurer's office, but in my mind's eye I imagine the walls are lined with a series of small glass frames marked 'Only break in case of emergency'. Inside each case is a catchphrase to be used when the economy is in trouble. Many of these will be familiar to anyone who has been following Australian politics for as long as I have. The modern day equivalent of the McMahon era is suitably vague and imprecise when he uses the term 'strong economy'. It appears no fewer than eight times in the Governor-General's address and is as fine a case of 'saying don't make it so' as I have seen. I think the idea is much the same as the McMahon-era maxim while reflecting the greater role now played by the independent Reserve Bank. Roughly translated, it means: even this government can't wreck the economy, because the Reserve Bank runs most of the show these days, anyway.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">More recent stock phrases we've had include terms like 'the best form of welfare is a job' and 'every extra job is one less person on welfare'. The former phrase rather presupposes that jobs are a form of welfare. They're not. The second forgets that when extra jobs are generated by increases in population both the numbers in employment and the numbers on welfare can increase simultaneously. You'd think that the nation's Treasurer would understand this sort of stuff.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Treasurer and this government certainly do know about is how to claim credit for the work of others. Claiming that every job created in Australia over the last six years is all the work of this government is as risible as it is dishonest. The truth is that even in a recession the numbers in employment may continue to grow even though the number of hours worked per employee is in decline, and we all know that there has been a large increase in those underworking in their jobs. Making increases in employment the barometer of national economic health sets the bar extremely low. The Treasurer should desist from further attempts to cloud the issue and get on with levelling with the Australian people about what's going on in the economy and why our jobs market is producing a number of jobs but still can't provide enough work for those who want it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In truth, there have been three positive developments in respect of jobs over the last few years, but none of those are ones that this government has created. The first is that policymakers at the Reserve Bank have at long last recognised that it's not necessary to hold the level of unemployment at five per cent or above to constrain inflation. In short, for now, we can have rapid jobs growth without blowing the lid off prices. Unnecessarily targeting unemployment so it is at a high so-called natural rate not only ensures that the economy cannot operate to potential; it uses government policy to deliberately deny people a job. The second is that we have generally managed the transition from a mining boom to more broadly based sources of growth relatively well, although there are still some black spots, such as the housing market in Western Australia. The third bit of good news is that 1.4 million jobs, many of them full time, have been created over the last five years. That has been barely enough to keep pace with increases in the working-age population through historically high levels of net migration and natural increase.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But the credit for these gains does not go to this government. It has been slow to increase spending on infrastructure and has held back federal spending, mostly on the poor and disadvantaged, at every opportunity. The Commonwealth might rightly claim to have not stuffed things up, but, in reality, it has been a bit player—a well-placed bystander rather than active participant—in job creation, and we desperately need more infrastructure spending, particularly on transport infrastructure, throughout Australia and in my electorate of Macarthur in particular.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has a political, not an economic, narrative on jobs. The government only wants to talk about jobs growth because the labour market is performing below historical norms and less impressively than the economies with which we are usually compared. The OECD figures for harmonised rates of unemployment over the last five to six years in countries I have mentioned show them dropping between 1.5 and four or more percentage points. Even in Canada, a former laggard, unemployment is now down to 5.7 per cent from 7.2 per cent in December 2013. In the UK, unemployment has dropped from 7.2 per cent in 2013 to under four per cent at the present time. Australia under the coalition has barely managed a drop of half a percentage point in unemployment over the last six years—much less than our competitors. The plain fact is that we still have fewer jobs than we need to provide employment for all those who want to work, particularly the young and older people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When this government talks about labour market reform, it barely gets past the platitudes. It is thoroughly clueless. To hear this government talk of labour market reform, you would think that unions were still as powerful as they were back in the 1950s. They are obsessed with unions. But unions protect workers; we all know that. The failings and conundrums of the Australian labour market barely scored a mention in the Governor-General's speech.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, this is a government that is big on marketing and very poor on much else. It targets the most vulnerable. It's not providing support in employment, housing and education. It's a great tragedy that we don't have more visionary policies.</span>

                <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:18</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Governor-General's address-in-reply. It's a real pleasure to follow the member for Macarthur, now in his well-deserved second term in this place. He has been, and is, a very real champion for some of the most vulnerable in our community, and I particularly commend his decades and decades of work providing paediatric care in the public hospital system. That commitment to our public system to ensure the accessibility of paediatric care is very critical.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as we know, the election didn't go the way that Labor had hoped. We did have big plans for the country, both in my old portfolio of health and in delivering more strategic nation-building infrastructure to boost economic growth and jobs across our cities and our regions. We would have invested $5 billion more over the next four years on nation-building infrastructure than that proposed by the Liberal and National government and over $10 billion more over the decade. As we are now learning from the spin of the government when it comes to infrastructure, our projects weren't off on the never-never. We were set to hit the ground running on significant new infrastructure funding now. From our ports to our airports, public transport systems to our roads, rail to coastal shipping we not only believed in greater public investment, we had the policies to make significant improvements to boost our economy and to improve our way of life, with projects carefully designed for boosting jobs in the short-term while lifting productivity and connectivity, connecting communities from the medium to the longer term.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the Leader of the Opposition who, for almost a decade, was Labor's Infrastructure and Transport Minister in government and spokesperson in opposition. I had the privilege of serving as his assistant minister in government. The member for Grayndler's passion for nation-building is second to none and he retains a formidable knowledge of the details of this portfolio, both the big and the very small, from the suburbs to our capital cities to our small rural communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">After six years in the health portfolio, I'm really excited to move back into a key economic portfolio in infrastructure and transport. Infrastructure investment does play a critical role in growing our economy and delivering jobs across our nation. It's a key part of Labor's economic and jobs agenda. Good government requires planning and building for the future. In the highly competitive, globalised world of the 21st century the prices consumers pay, the profits businesses make, the quality of life people enjoy and the export income earned will more than ever depend on the adequacy and quality of our nation's infrastructure. Modern, smart, well-planned infrastructure stimulates growth, it creates jobs and training opportunities in the immediate term but it also sets the nation up for our future growth. But we don't get there by accident.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government in failing to articulate an economic plan for our nation has also failed to articulate a plan for connecting and developing our nation's infrastructure, our transport sector and our regions. However, one thing our Prime Minister can do is a marketing campaign. We've learned at Senate estimates this week that the federal government spent some $17 million on a taxpayer funded advertising blitz promising to bust congestion. The national media buy across TV, print, radio, digital and cinema from mid-January this year to when the election was called was over $200,000 a day. That's $200,000 a day spent on advertising. In contrast, 18 months ago the Urban Congestion Fund and the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative were announced with great fanfare. The funds allegedly had budgets in the billions of dollars. How much did the federal government spend from those funds in the 18 months in mainland Australia last financial year? Not a single cent. Despite all the hype, in the whole of the 2018-19 year, not a single cent was spent from the Urban Congestion Fund. In that same year $2.2 million was spent from the Roads of Strategic Importance. I think that's $0.06 million on the one highway in western Tasmania. That means that the Prime Minister, in fact, spent eight times as much advertising infrastructure as he did on actually building anything out of those two flagship transport funds. It is clear that the Prime Minister's infrastructure program is a political document but it is not an economic plan.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, Labor has always been the party of nation-building. Only Labor governments have had the courage to dream big and to build the infrastructure necessary to unlock our nation's potential. From the transcontinental railway, the Snowy Hydro scheme, the National Highway network and the nation's capital here in Canberra through to the wonder of the Sydney Opera House, to our humble urban sewerage networks, to modern setting in place core frameworks for future infrastructure projects—like the National Broadband Network, the Western Sydney Airport and Inland Rail—Labor's core purpose is that of nation-building to deliver jobs today and to improve productivity and connectedness in the longer term.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">While nationally the result of the election may have been disappointing, locally I was touched and humbled by support that I received from the Ballarat community. In every corner of the electorate, from Ballarat to Bacchus Marsh to Daylesford to Warren Heath to Clunes to Elaine, a positive campaign and our plans for the future for our region were given a ringing endorsement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I love our community. It's my home, it's where I bring up my son and to be our region's representative in federal parliament is the greatest honour of my life. To be re-elected with a positive swing of 3.62 per cent is a fantastic outcome, and it would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our wonderful Labor volunteers. In particular, I must thank my campaign chair, Craig Fletcher; my campaign director, Emma Harding; my entire committee and team; and all of my incredibly hardworking staff, who worked so hard through the campaign. I also particularly want to pay tribute to my personal staff in the Health portfolio, Andrew Garrett and Adam Gartrell, who did work incredibly hard through some very difficult times on the campaign trail.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again I want to offer my sincere thanks to one of Ballarat's favourite sons, Steve Bracks, who continued his tradition of launching just about every campaign that takes place in our region. He's our good luck charm. On election day we had an incredible 202 volunteers on booths in every single corner of the electorate and, as I travelled around on that bright, sunny day, I was touched by our community, by the volunteers who were out in force and by the smiles that were on everyone's faces. I had my then 10-year-old son with me for his first election day campaign, handing out for the whole day, and he did a sterling job, beating me to the punch most times in getting how-to-vote cards in people's hands.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">These people volunteer for Labor because they know that we offer the best for our region. Only Labor have shown ourselves prepared to take our regions seriously and invest in the future of our community. At the election, Labor made clear that regional Australia and Ballarat should not be an afterthought. We went to the election with plans to invest almost $50 million in projects across our community. We planned to finish the job at Her Majesty's Theatre, invest in active tourism infrastructure in Hepburn Shire, build much-needed sporting facilities in Bacchus Marsh, develop Birch into an important regional and health and education hub and invest in turning Ballarat Airport into a facility fit for a growing regional city. This is on top of an additional $21 million that would have been delivered to Ballarat's public schools.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In stark contrast, the Liberals failed to match any of our commitments—not a single one—in our region, offering grants funding to only two projects located within the city of Ballarat. They offered nothing to Daylesford, to Trentham, to Ballan or to Bacchus Marsh and certainly nothing to Darley. They didn't take our region seriously, and the voters of Ballarat recognised that. We know that Labor's investments would have improved our services and we know that investing in community infrastructure helps regional cities and towns to grow and to attract and retain the workers needed to power regional economic development.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional Australia shouldn't be an afterthought or, frankly, subject to which seat your local member happens to be a part of. Just next door in the marginal seat of Corangamite, which Labor was able to pick up, there was over $3 billion worth of Liberal Party election commitments. While I hope very much that Corangamite sees every single cent of those commitments, the government needs to explain to other people in other regional communities why those living along the Surf Coast and near Geelong deserve greater investment than those living in the communities like Wollongong, Ballarat, Bacchus Marsh or Daylesford in my community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve investment based on real need and real opportunities, not based on the political needs of the Liberal and National parties. Over this term, the Morrison government has the challenge of proving that it is serious for governing for all Australians and serious about actually investing properly in regional development. If they want tips, they should listen to the people of Ballarat and invest in the facilities, infrastructure in our community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Again I want to say thank you very much to the people of Ballarat for putting their faith in me. I promise to keep doing what I said I would do when I was first elected in 2001: to keep standing up for our community and for our fair share of federal government investment.</span>

                </a>  As I was saying, I just want to say thank you very much to the people of Ballarat for once again putting their faith in me. As I promised to do on the day that I first stood for election back in 2001, I promise to keep standing up for you and our community to ensure that we do get a fair share of federal government investment. And I promise you do have a strong representative here in the federal parliament for the interests of our community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank those whose tireless campaigning supported my re-election. I not only want to acknowledge my campaign chair and my campaign director, but also the entire committee. I thank the people who put all of the booth rosters and booth kits together, who came doorknocking with me, who did telephone canvassing, who did the substantial amounts of work that go into a campaign. I particularly want to acknowledge my husband, whose birthday it was this week. He's been through a few campaigns with me. I think this might have been my seventh, or sixth, and he's been there by my side. I very much appreciate that.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Already in this term the member for Gorton and I have raised in this place one of the issues that we intend to focus on as part of the upcoming term, and that's the state of the Western Highway. This is a highway that is basically the artery of Victoria. It runs from the South Australian border right the way through to Melbourne. Under the Labor government, we started the substantial process of duplicating this highway. All of the councils along the highway corridor had an agreement where, basically, they listed a whole heap of priorities about where they wanted the highway redevelopment to go. Councils on the South Australian border basically campaigned and championed projects that had nothing to do with their own constituencies and, subsequently, Labor started funding all of those. One of those priorities was the duplication of the Western Highway from the Ballarat to Stawell. We started that process when we were in government. The funding stalled for that—the project has kept going because Labor's money was still in the pipeline—but I was pleased to see that the government did, in the budget in May, finally bring that money forward to continue that project. It's too important not to. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What is happening now is that, 10 or 20 years down the track from that initial project, the population coming out of Melbourne has absolutely boomed down that bottom end of the highway and there are really substantial constraints there. We have called on the federal government to work with the state on how we can actually improve the road links to Melbourne for this rapidly growing population that starts around Rockbank and through Caroline Springs, which has also had huge population growth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I love living in regional Australia. I wouldn't live anywhere else. I know millions and millions of others do, including the two members of the Labor Party we have in the chamber with us, and I know millions would relish the chance of being able to do so. That is why we need a federal government that will do the hard work to plan and fund the infrastructure we need to improve living standards in our regions and improve the way in which our regions connect to each other—and not only connect to our cities. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But cities are important too. It shouldn't be a city versus country or bush versus city debate, but for six years we've had the Liberals talking a really big game about decentralisation. I want to say a couple of things about this. The first thing, for many of us who have seen this debate come and go over time, is that we'd just really like you to restore the jobs you've cut already. I've had masses of jobs cut out of my Centrelink office and my Medicare office. We used to have both an AusIndustry and an Austrade public servant living in Ballarat. I've watched all of these jobs, over time, go from my regional community. They were important for helping us invest in export industries, expand our industries and access government grant programs. I wish you would put the jobs back in that you've taken out, for a start. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When you do talk about decentralisation, it has basically been about moving public servants to Adelaide—Adelaide needs some help; I don't want to decry that—and to Perth, Brisbane and Parramatta. It hasn't actually meant anything, other than in the egregious case of what happened with the APVMA. As for sending lots of jobs out to regional centres like Ballarat, it just hasn't happened. The government's own documents show that not a single federal public servant has moved to regional Victoria under its decentralisation agenda. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It can't just be about moving public servants or government agencies to National Party seats. If you're going to talk about that, it's about: what are the services that regional communities need to have delivered, what is the role for the Commonwealth in ensuring there are public sector opportunities for those services to be delivered in our region, and have we got the people there who can do that, partnering with state and local government services? We've got things like Primary Health Networks in our regions as well. We can look at those as a platform to build that good public sector service base for the Commonwealth, rather than the way in which the government has gone about it. For real decentralisation, governments should act as an enabler connecting our regions to our cities and vice versa, to inspire people to look at locating in our regions for economic growth. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We do need a federal government that has a genuine and transparent infrastructure program that does support new road and rail projects while ensuring existing assets are upgraded and maintained. This government is complaining now because we're coming after it on individual projects. We're pointing out issues with their funding profiles for projects which, I suspect, a lot of members who stood beside the Prime Minister for some of these announcements were completely unaware of. You've got election brochures across the country with Liberal and National Party MPs saying, 'Delivered,' and then you look at the funding profile for project after project, and they're not there for, in some cases, five, six or seven years—if at all. You've got communities like Geelong, who absolutely believe that fast rail is going to be delivered and want it delivered very quickly, but you know there's a $2 billion offer on the table and it's probably about a $10 billion project. So we're talking about a very long time down the track before that's a reality. But I'm quite sure the member for Corangamite was telling everyone she'd delivered fast rail and that it would be there tomorrow, and that is people's expectation. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">So the government can't complain if we now come after it. They say it's a $100 billion plan. You can see them coming up with this in an office somewhere, going: 'Is it $50 billion? We're spending more than that. Let's chuck in the financial assistance grants to councils. What does that add up to?' There's a funny television program, <span style="font-style:italic;">Utopia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> where they might do that. Again, the government has talked this up and there's absolutely no way it's going to deliver the sorts of expectations it's raised in communities everywhere. It doesn't have a proper plan for infrastructure. It had a plan to try to win an election and it's now got to try and retrofit that into things like its national freight and transport strategy and how that connects our ports; it's got to work out how all of that connects. So, when it comes to the future for infrastructure, this government unfortunately has talked a big game but has delivered very, very little, as we've seen.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time for the government, now in its seventh year, to end the spin, get to work, deliver a real plan for our economy, deliver a real plan for infrastructure, create jobs, improve productivity and actually spend money on busting congestion, not just on advertising.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MARLES</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  Can I firstly acknowledge the member for Ballarat, who is a neighbour of mine, particularly as she referenced her joy in living in regional Australia, which I know is a joy that is shared with me by members present. It is something that I very much identify with, and there is a sense in which Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong, as the largest regional centres in Victoria, share a lot in common. Certainly the member for Ballarat and I often compare notes about our electorates, the campaigns within them and the sorts of challenges we face. A lot of what the member for Ballarat has just spoken about resonates with me significantly, and I'll talk about that in a moment. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This election was obviously a very difficult one for Labor nationally, but there was a local campaign in my electorate of Corio which had a very good result and saw a significant swing to Labor as a result. I want to take the opportunity today in this speech on the address-in-reply to talk a little bit about that campaign and to thank the many, many people who helped me in it. Ultimately, we certainly do not do any of this on our own. We stand on the shoulders of others, and this is a moment to acknowledge them. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The first point to make is that there had been a redistribution in the lead-up to this election which saw my electorate change the most that it has since I came to parliament in 2007. I lost parts of the Bellarine Peninsula, the townships of Leopold and Moolap, to the electorate of Corangamite but in its stead gained a number of suburbs of urban Geelong—Belmont, Highton and Wandana Heights. I went to primary school in Highton. These were places I had spent time in in my youth, but we become very parochial as MPs and tend to see the world as bounded by the borders of our electorate. So it was nice for me to rediscover a part of Geelong which had been a significant part of my childhood. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of very significant issues came up during the local campaign. I was very pleased with the emphasis that was placed on Geelong by the Labor campaign nationally in terms of the commitments that were made. One of the real difficulties in being on the wrong end of a campaign nationally is that so many of the promises that you work so hard to achieve for your electorate obviously don't come to fruition. Nothing is achieved from the opposition benches. It is a place of impotence. It is the Treasury benches where you get to make a difference. But I do want to mention those promises, because they speak to the commitment and the focus that we were placing upon parts of Geelong. They included a $50 million commitment to the new women's and children's hospital in Geelong, such a fantastic initiative of the Andrews state government, which we committed to participating in. There was $40 million for the redevelopment of Baxter House Hospital, including the development of a dedicated elective surgery centre. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a $20 million commitment to finally finish the redevelopment of Geelong's Kardinia Park, which now stands where it is, even prior to the final stage being finished, as the biggest piece of sporting infrastructure in regional Australia. It is home to what is easily the largest sporting organisation in regional Australia, the Geelong Football Club, which would be multiple times bigger than the next biggest club in regional Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The existence of the Geelong Football Club in Geelong is far from an inevitability. A way to think about that is the difficulty and the challenge that the state of Tasmania has in getting a team in the AFL. The fact that a regional city like Geelong already has a team in the AFL speaks to how much of an achievement that is and how it is not inevitable. But the existence of Geelong Football Club, the second oldest football club of any code in the world today, does tend to lead us take it for granted. The redevelopment of Kardinia Park is at the heart of making sure that the Geelong Football Club is future-proofed as a team within the AFL, which, in turn, is so profoundly important to the identity of Geelong itself. I was really pleased to see Labor make a commitment to what would have seen the finishing of the Kardinia Park stadium.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There was $15 million for Anam Cara House, which is a hospice, although to call it simply a hospice doesn't do it justice. It is a state-of-the-art facility which is about making what is a special time in people's lives—the moment in which they end their life—one which they can share with their families in the most dignified way possible. Anam Cara exists in Geelong today. It is a remarkable institution. This money would have seen the redevelopment of Anam Cara on a new site.</span>

                <a href="HWQ" type="MemberContinuation">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr MARLES:</span>
                </a>  Before the suspension, I was referring to the commitments that Labor made in the electorate of Corio during the federal election. There was a $14 million commitment to an adult mental health hub to be established in Corio, $460,000 to upgrade facilities in several schools across the electorate of Corio and a partnering with the Andrews government to deliver the South Geelong to Waurn Ponds rail duplication.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a number of measures that we committed to that were part of what the Andrews government had committed to in terms of the Geelong City Deal, and particularly through the stage 3 of the Building Better Regions Fund projects. There was $2 billion to improve the ABC facilities in Geelong. There was emergency relief funding of $76,000 for Bethany Community Support. There was $546,000 for Diversitat, which is also known as the Geelong Ethnic Communities Council. There was $5,000 for the Belmont Toy Library. Really importantly, there was $2 million for the GROW project, which looked at tackling issues of joblessness and addressing disadvantage in the areas of greatest vulnerability within the electorate of Corio, which would be the northern suburbs of Corio—places like Norlane and Corio, along with suburbs such as Whittington.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, a large focus of the policies that Labor was putting forward nationally were focused on communities such as those that exist in the northern suburbs of Geelong. It is a real issue that, whilst Geelong itself is actually travelling pretty well across a whole lot of stats in the aftermath of difficult decisions that were made in the private sector and has done well, I think, to get past the big economic shocks—the ceasing of the manufacture of cars at Ford, the closing of the Point Henry aluminium smelter—there are parts of Geelong that are not travelling as well. Norlane and Corio are examples. Whittington is another. It's really important that we are focused on how we address issues of urban poverty in this country, and those suburbs have more than their fair share of that. It is a real focus for Labor to look at how we can best deal with that, and I certainly felt very proud about a number of the policies that were being put forward, particularly in policy areas such as health and education, in terms of the way in which they would have impacted positively on those in Norlane, Corio and Whittington.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What is sad is that, whilst a number of those commitments were matched by the government—and we will certainly be holding the Morrison government to account in terms of the delivery of their commitments—a number of the commitments that I've just gone through were not matched by the government and will not happen because we did not win. As I said at the outset, one of the things that hurts the most about being on the wrong end of election day is that commitments that you've worked so hard to make ultimately are not delivered upon. But we will continue to advocate for those issues and causes over the next three years and will certainly seek to do that beyond then.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Having made those remarks, I want to take this opportunity to thank the very many people who helped support my re-election in the electorate of Corio. In doing so, it really was a very good local result. We saw a four per cent plus swing to Labor on first preferences and a more than two per cent swing to Labor on the two-party preferred result. It's a result that many people who assisted me can feel very proud of. Firstly, I want to thank Bill Shorten, our leader going into the election, and Tanya Plibersek, the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party going into the election, for the leadership that they showed and the tireless efforts that they put in across the country. They certainly supported me in the electorate of Corio. The election result was a devastating outcome for both of them in particular, but I want them to know that there are Labor candidates across Australia, of which I am most certainly one, who are ever grateful for the efforts they put in.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank Noah Carroll and Paul Erickson from the national office of the ALP and Sam Rae and Kosmos Samaras from the Victorian branch of the Labor Party for the efforts that they put in at an organisation level towards supporting my campaign in Corio. I would like to acknowledge the Labor team, state and federal, in Geelong: John Eren, the member for Lara; Lisa Neville, the member for Bellarine; Chris Couzens, the member for Geelong; Darren Cheeseman, the member for South Barwon; and Gayle Tierney, the upper house member for Western Victoria. We are a team. They were very much there, supporting me on election day. Both Gayle and Lisa are ministers in the Andrews government. John was a minister in the Andrews government prior to the last state election. They're all very busy people, but they were all incredibly supportive of my efforts in seeking re-election in the electorate of Corio.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to thank Libby Coker, who is now—and I feel very proud in saying this—the member for Corangamite. Libby for a long time had been Labor's candidate for Corangamite: back in the 2016 election and in the 2019 election. So, over a very significant period of time, obviously without pay because, when you seek to win a seat off an incumbent, you do so from a very significant disadvantage, Libby had fronted day in, day out, being the salesperson of Labor's policies in the electorate of Corangamite, knocking on doors and making phone calls. Her efforts were tireless. It is, I think, worth saying that her opponent, the former member for Corangamite, now Senator Sarah Henderson, was formidable. Sarah also worked incredibly hard, and I acknowledge her at this moment as well. In acknowledging Sarah as being a very formidable person, it is actually the highest compliment that one can pay to Libby in terms of her efforts ultimately being successful in winning the Corangamite election.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Corio and Corangamite kind of are twins in this place. There's a degree to which we work as partners and, in that respect, that was the case with Sarah Henderson when she was the member for Corangamite, in terms of representing Geelong in the House of Representatives. But it was a joy to work with Libby as a partner in that, and I just feel so pleased for her that she is now able to take her place in the House of Representatives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There were an extraordinary number of commitments that were made by the Morrison government in the electorate of Corangamite in the lead-up to the 2019 election, and we will be holding the Morrison government to account in respect of delivering on those commitments. There were very many sporting clubs and a whole lot of infrastructure commitments. The member for Ballarat mentioned earlier that a lot of those are on the never-never: the fast rail to Geelong, the $2 billion committed which, in fact, we won't see until the latter part of the next decade despite there being billboards everywhere saying that it had been delivered. It's certainly not been delivered, and there is no station where you can get on the fast train. But we will be holding this government to account in terms of the delivery of those promises.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank my office, who are a huge support to me. A number of them are here now. I am basically the product of their work. Saverina Chirumbolo has worked with me—she did something wrong in a past life, but she has worked with me!—since the year 2000. You get less for much more serious crimes! But I am incredibly grateful that Sav has decided to spend that time with me. Catherine Bergin, Tony Hodges, Simon Furey, Alison Marchant, Haley Bamford, Kylie Nicholson, Geraldine Eren, Michael Tate, Bassel Tallal, Jett Fogarty and Lena De Rosso—I thank you all. There were so many volunteers who participated in the campaign, knocking on doors, making phone calls, standing with me during street stalls, turning up early in the morning at train stations, particularly on those wet mornings and, of course, standing there on election day—actually on the prepoll but also on election day—handing out, and I cannot thank you enough.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't mention all of you, but I would like to mention a number. First are Lidija Ivanovski and Ella George, who are enormous supports to me and, indeed, now work in my office but were very supportive during the campaign. There were also Pauline Synot, Kye Cole, Brodie Appleby, Daniel Kovacev, Louie Hehir, Stephen Hogg, Damien Marchant, Vlad Selakovic, Leonie Sheedy, Darren Lamont, Josh Knight, Daniel Garcia, James Rankin, Connor Parker, Kelly Toyne, Ian Trezise, Chris Van Ingen, Justin Mills, Gagandeep Mirankot, Gagan Cheema, Gail Cook, Jake Cranny, Moshtagh Heidari, Harry Adam, Claire Rowe and the many Young Labor members who came down from Melbourne, Rasoul Omid, Samad Rasouli and so many from the Hazara community, and Kevin O'Leary. And there were so many more. Forgive me for not mentioning your names, but I particularly wanted to mention those that I have.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There were, of course, a number from the great Australian trade union movement who also supported me in this campaign, and I find that gratifying because it's where I spent 14 years of my life before entering this place. I'd like to acknowledge Russell and Glenn Menzies from the plumbers union. Russell, affectionately known as 'Ox' in Geelong, was responsible for putting up hundreds of corflute signs, and I very much thank him. Troy Knight and Michael Watson, from the Electrical Trades Union; Dylan Wight and Ian Jones from the AMWU and a number of volunteers from Geelong Trades Hall: I thank all of you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank the two Liberal candidates, in fact. Murray Angus was the original Liberal candidate preselected to run against me. On the very first interview that Murray gave on the day on which he was preselected, he said that he thought I was a really good bloke. He was disendorsed that night, and so I thank Murray for those comments and I'm sorry that I caused him such grief in terms of his eventual outcome! He was replaced by Alastair Thomson, who was, to be honest, very good company during the course of many days. We stood together at prepolls, and Al is a great guy. Representing a major political party in a federal seat is a big thing to do. Tens of thousands of people vote for you, and I acknowledge that he gave those people of Corio who voted Liberal in the election a voice. I thank Al for the work that he put in in doing that.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would of course like to thank my family. My children: Sam, Isabella, Harvey and Georgia are much suffering in having to endure, I guess, the life that I've chosen, which is not their choice. I thank them for the hours that they miss me and, indeed, for the number of hours that they put into helping for this campaign. I can't do what I do but for their love. And, most of all, I want to thank my wife, Rachel Schutze. Again, Rachel is a conscript in this; she is not a volunteer. But she does it with the greatest of humour. Without Rachel in my life I would not be able to be here or do what I do.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I was asked on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Today</span> show on Friday what I do when I get stressed, and there is a very simple answer to that: I ring Rachel and talk to her about whatever it is. Often, I just talk to her about the family, but a conversation with my wife makes all the troubles of this place go away within a minute. I thank her dearly for that, each and every day, and I thank her for the love that she gives me. I love her dearly. With that, I thank her and all of those who were involved in my campaign. I am very lucky to have the people around me that I do.</span>

                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  I begin by acknowledging the voters of Franklin at the last federal election campaign. I have said in my newsletter to them that I am very humbled and honoured to continue to be their federal member of parliament. Like the previous speaker, the member for Corio, I was first elected in 2007, so to be re-elected again in 2019 is a really humbling experience as a local member. I want to assure the voters of Franklin that I will not let them down. I will continue to fight hard for them, both locally and also for Tasmania as a state, and in my shadow ministerial portfolios of ageing and seniors, and for women.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all of the wonderful volunteers who helped on my campaign, but I particularly want to put out a big thank you to my staff. Some of my staff have been with me for a very long time and I want to put on the record my thanks to Lisa Mycko; Liam Carswell; Gabby Morrison; Jackson Tegg; Kayleigh Meumann, who worked for me during the campaign and prior; and Claire Vickers. I also want to thank one of my current team, who since the election has also been helping me, Kelly-Anne Webb.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms COLLINS:</span>
                </a>  They put in a tremendous amount of effort, way beyond what they are paid for and way beyond what many people in other jobs would do. So I want to put on the record my thanks to them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to put on the record my thanks to my local campaign team. As I said, particularly to those people who went on prepoll for me day in, day out. It has been talked about post the election, the amount of time that prepoll was open during that campaign—three weeks was an extraordinary amount of time for volunteers to staff campaigns. I want to thank those people who stood on prepoll in my electorate for me and for the Labor team. I'm very grateful for that.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the two local senators. My duty senator, Senator Catryna Bilyk, continued to be a great support throughout the campaign and has been a great supporter since I was elected in 2007. Catryna and I worked the electorate of Franklin very, very hard, and we were able to secure a swing to the Labor Party at the last federal election. Catryna is a big part of that. Senator Carol Brown, has been a great friend of mine for many years, and was a great support during the campaign. Two state members, David O'Byrne and Alison Standen, helped out on my campaign in street stalls and doorknocked with me. We also had an upper house election running two weeks prior to the federal campaign, and I want to congratulate the local member there Jo Siejka, who's the member for Pembroke within my seat. Having both of us working in the electorate hard at the same time certainly helped lift the Labor vote for both of us, so it was a terrific outcome to also see her re-elected.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">An extraordinary thing happened in the Franklin campaign during the election. We did a radio forum where the Liberal candidate, Dean Young—and I want to say that he did a terrific job, and I want to acknowledge how difficult it is to put your hand up and nominate for public office—was very, very honest. He was asked what commitments he had for the Franklin electorate. He said none. He was very honest. There were no Liberal Party or government commitments in the electorate of Franklin during the last federal election campaign—not one. Zero. Absolutely nothing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I can understand why that might be the case, because government actually still hasn't delivered on the commitment it made in the 2016 election, which was for an upgrade of the Hobart airport roundabout. The roundabout is on the border of my electorate and the member for Lyons. This roundabout gets a lot of traffic in peak times and is an issue both for locals who are commuting but also for tourists coming in and out of Tasmania through the Hobart airport. The Hobart airport roundabout is obviously located partly on airport land, state government land and local government land. They made a commitment, copying Labor's commitment during the 2016 federal election, to upgrade this intersection and to do some form of underpass or overpass or slip lane to improve access to the Hobart Airport and for the commuters going straight through. They made the commitment, and we said at the time, 'We don't think that that's enough.'—our commitment was substantially more. And we heard in estimates, just this week, that it turns out we were right. At Senate estimates, held earlier this week, it was revealed that there was a $20-million blowout in the cost of upgrading this intersection. So it's gone, from combined contributions from state and federal government, from $30 million to $50 million to upgrade this. Indeed, when Senator Brown asked the departmental official, 'Has this increased the cost because it's been so delayed?'—this roundabout was supposed to be finished in 2020. It looks like it won't start until sometime next year, so it's certainly not going to be finished as it's at least a two-year project. They said, 'The cost would probably be higher than was originally envisaged.' The $24 million that the Commonwealth was putting in was for a $50-million project, so we don't know how this $20-million black hole is going to be funded, and we still don't know, and we can't tell local residents when they're actually going to be able to drive through this upgraded intersection. It is incredible that in 2019, almost 2020, I'm here saying that the government still hasn't delivered on its election commitment to upgrade a roundabout from 2016. Who would have thought it!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, in southern Tasmania, something which affects a lot of people that live in my electorate who regularly drive is the Bridgewater Bridge replacement that is actually in the member for Lyons' electorate. Again, this is a project that has had more announcements and more people saying they're going to build this bridge than any other project I can remember. There have been at least half a dozen announcements that this is going to happen. But we've now found out that the state Liberal government, in its ineptitude, mucked up the business case, and Infrastructure Australia has said it doesn't stack up even though the federal government has put aside funds for it. So we won't actually know what the design is going to look like until next year, let alone get the bridge started and have some construction on it. So there's more chaos on the infrastructure projects in Tasmania post-election.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more extraordinary, we heard in estimates this week that the majority of the money for the Hobart City Deal, particularly for the Sorell-Tasman Bridge corridor, which runs through my and the member for Lyons's electorates, won't be delivered until after the next federal election, which is due in 2022. So we have a situation with infrastructure in southern Tasmania around my electorate where the government has made various commitments but none of the projects have started yet. We don't know what one of them will look like, and most of the money for the other won't come in till after 2022. It is quite extraordinary that the government is saying, 'We're delivering all this congestion-busting infrastructure,' but I can't even get a roundabout upgrade to an intersection that was promised in 2016. Work hasn't even started.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Health was a very big issue in Tasmania during the election. We have some really serious situations in our public hospitals not only in Launceston and in Hobart but also on the north-west coast. The Launceston General Hospital and the Royal Hobart Hospital, in particular, have a very serious issue with ambulance ramping. That occurs when people are in an ambulance and it gets ramped because there's no room in the emergency department for the people who are unwell. It got to the point in Hobart a few months ago that we actually had a situation where there were no ambulances available if somebody had had a heart attack, because they were all ramped at the hospital. It is incredible that we can be in a position where the state Liberal government is saying, 'We need to cut more from the health system and more from the hospitals,' when we have this situation happening. Why is this happening? It is happening because people aren't going to their GP. They aren't accessing primary care, because they can't afford the massively increased out-of-pocket expenses because of the extended freeze on the Medicare rebate. That is what is happening. Yes, Tasmania has an older population. Yes, Tasmania has more chronic disease. Yes, we have poorer health outcomes in Tasmania because we are poorer and the social determinants of health are impacting. But when you can't get an ambulance to go and get seen at the local public hospital in the capital city, we have a really serious problem in our health system. Labor had a plan to address that. The government matched some of it but not all of it, and nowhere near enough in terms of commitments for health, during the federal election campaign.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Worse than that was what happened with other commitments from the Labor Party, one in particular for AFL. Tasmanians are very proud of our AFL, our Australian rules football history. We want our own team. We believe that we've sent enough hugely talented players to the mainland to play in mainland teams to have our own team. Federal Labor has always been very committed to supporting a Tasmanian team in the AFL. What the Liberal federal government did during the federal election campaign, with the imprimatur of its state colleagues, was allow them to contrast health funding and AFL, saying that they would rather put the money into health. They tried to divide Tasmanians in the north from those in the south. It was a really dishonest, grubby campaign. It was untrue, because Labor was going to put a lot more money into health than it was going to put into football. They also said the money was going to the AFL, whereas the money was going into infrastructure in local communities to support AFL in Tasmania. It was a complete fabrication. I am disgusted that, post the election, the Liberal Party at both state and federal levels are saying that they support an AFL team for Tasmania. They derailed it during the election campaign. They put back our having a team in the AFL.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that is really significant and has been topical in the last few weeks is, of course, funding for TAFE. The TAFE system in Tasmania has been decimated under the state Liberal government. There's no other way to put it. We have a tradie shortage in Tasmania because building is going quite well, thanks to quite a few federal Labor projects that were funded and are still going on, such as the Royal Hobart Hospital and upgrades to the University of Tasmania. You would have thought that the TAFE system would have been able to support local businesses to put on apprentices and to train them in local facilities. Unfortunately, in southern Tasmania the local training facilities are more than 30 years old. They're archaic, they're out of date and they're no longer fit for purpose. The state government has made a commitment to fund some upgrades to the TAFE Clarence campus in my electorate. Federal Labor matched that commitment during the federal election, but we've heard nothing from the federal government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">And now, since the federal government has a TAFE fund I call on the federal government and the state Liberal government to ensure that the Clarence campus of TAFE in my electorate gets the upgrades and gets the trades school that it needs to have facilities for young Tasmanians to be able to do the trades training they want to do in southern Tasmania. It is obscene that when my son left school just last year, after year 12, he and his mates that wanted to go to TAFE, five of them, could not get in. They were not accepted because there were not enough places, because the TAFE system is so underfunded and it has not been properly managed by the state Liberal government over quite a few years. They've ripped money out so there's not been enough trained staff to teach people and the facilities are so run down. It is an absolute disgrace. We have young Tasmanians that want to stay in our state, that want to get a qualification, and they can't. They're denied a place by the state Liberal government. That's what's happening in Tasmania today. It's simply not good enough.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the housing crisis. We have a very significant housing crisis in Tasmania. People are always surprised when I talk about how housing affordability, particularly in Tasmania and particularly in Hobart, is some of the worst in the country. It's some of the worst in the country because the rents are very, very high and the incomes are low. There is a demand because a lot of people are moving to Tasmania and there haven't been enough homes built to house all of the people that want to come to Tasmania. The infrastructure and the planning by the state government has been absolutely woefully inadequate. They've gone around touting an increased population policy and saying how great they are for getting more people to come. What they forgot to do was to build the infrastructure for the people that turned up. The transport infrastructure, the school infrastructure, the community infrastructure has not been built. It has not been planned for by the Liberal state government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I have schools who are busting at the seams who have got demountables. I have congested roads, as we talked about earlier . We also have an issue about housing. There are not enough homes to house people. We're getting middle-income families ringing my office saying that their rent has gone up $30 a week. They are going to have to move out and they will be homeless. They have nowhere to go. That is what has been happening in Tasmania. We've had a really serious homelessness issue for well over two years—really serious. It was only recently that the federal government took notice and decided to waive our historic public housing debt of $150 million. That $150 million was over 11 years and it pales into insignificance when you consider last time federal Labor was in government. Over six years we invested more than $450 million in public and social housing in Tasmania. That's $450 million over six years versus $150 million over 11. No wonder we have a housing crisis in Tasmania, because this federal government has not done its part over the last six years, and clearly has no intention of playing its part any more over the next three than what it's done to date. It's a real shame for those Tasmanians who are currently homeless, or those Tasmanians who are at risk of becoming homeless at the moment because of their rental increases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania we have also had some issues around full-time work. There has been a significant loss of thousands of full-time jobs in Tasmania. We heard from our state Liberal Premier that Tasmania is the turnaround economy—things are going great, the economy's going gangbusters but the reality is that's only for some Tasmanians. For those Tasmanians who are trying to seek full-time work that is not the situation. For those Tasmanians, as I've outlined, who are at risk of homelessness, or who are renting, that is not the case. For those Tasmanians stuck in traffic, commuting for very significant times of a morning and of an afternoon, because the state government and federal government haven't got their act together and built the infrastructure, it is not going okay in Tasmania.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the Premier talking all the time about how wonderful it is and the unemployment rate in Tasmania's better than it has been—all of this rhetoric going on all the time—but for those Tasmanians who have lost their full-time job it is not okay. For those Tasmanians who are trying to live on Newstart it is not okay. Over a third of Tasmanians have their primary source of income on a government support payment. Over a third, because of the poverty in our state, because of the ageing population and because of some of the dispersed regional economies that we have. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When this government ignores calls for Newstart to be increased, it's pretty callous for those Tasmanians who are at risk of homelessness, to those who don't have access to affordable public transport, because public transport in Tasmania is incredibly expensive, particularly if you're in a commuter suburb and trying to get into the city for interviews. I cannot believe the callousness of this government, which says, 'It's unfunded empathy and we're not going to do anything about it.' These Tasmanians, like other Australians living on Newstart, are really struggling. They are relying on family support, neighbour support and charity support to live day in, day out—not just occasionally but day in, day out—because they can't afford to go and get themselves job ready. They can't afford the bus ticket to go to an interview. They can't afford to go and get their medicines when they get sick. They can't afford to go to a GP, because Newstart is too low. Everybody in this place, I think, admits it. The new federal Liberal member for Bass—I congratulate her on that—said that she thinks it should increase. I know there are many people in the government that agree with Labor and that agree with most of the community that Newstart should be increased. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this government need to seriously look at increasing Newstart. They need to do the modelling about the best way to ensure that those people in Australia who are currently doing it tough today can actually get the support that they need, because most of them want to work. We know that women over the age of 55 are the growing cohort of people on Newstart. There are a lot of people on Newstart over the age of 55 who've worked their entire lives then been made redundant; they can't get a job. They can't get a job primarily because of age discrimination, not because they don't have the skills and not because they don't want to work but simply because of age discrimination. It's not good enough, and this government needs to do something about it. Rest assured, as I finish my speech, that I will continue to stand up for Tasmanians and continue to stand up for my electorate. I place on record again my thanks to the good people of Franklin.</span>

                <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  After successive years of Liberal governments—the Abbott government, the Turnbull government and now the Morrison government—we've lost that tag of the 'Lucky Country'. We were known around the world as Australia, the Lucky Country—and we were lucky. There were jobs for all. We got to pick and choose where we wanted to work. Our farms and lands were doing well. Unfortunately, in the last decade or so, we've lost that tag. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't matter whether you're a farmer, a factory worker, a journalist trying to report the news and do your job, a person trying to get work or a vocational education, a pensioner trying to enjoy your twilight years after you've worked all your life and paid your taxes, a worker hoping your wages will rise at least in line with the cost of living, or a family trying to make ends meet, this government is failing you. There's absolutely no big picture agenda. There's no plan, no process for the country. We see piecemeal plans cobbled together when pressure from the media, the constituency, lobbyists et cetera gets too great. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to speak about the drought. Today we saw the government's response to the drought which is crippling our nation. People are doing it really tough out there. The government's response goes against the recommendations of the Productivity Commission's extensive report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Government drought support</span>. There is no national drought plan from this government. The government is refusing to release the report from the Coordinator-General for Drought, Major General Stephen Day. Close to $6 million in Australian taxes have been spent on this report. It was commissioned by the government, and the government is keeping it a secret. We need to know why this government has such a problem with being transparent. The government want to silence their own commissioned reports and, as we've seen, they want to silence our journalists as well. Who's next and what's next? </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been contacted by many concerned constituents and residents of my electorate of Adelaide who are quite distressed about the lack of freedom of the press. For example, a gentleman by the name of Tim emailed me just this week. The subject line of the email was aptly titled 'Courage'. His email went on to say:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am concerned that the balance of 'need to know' vs 'national security' has swung too far in the direction of 'national security'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I would appeal to you to add your weight to adjusting legislation to rectify this imbalance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I realise that for many politicians and bureaucrats this exposes them to added scrutiny which may be uncomfortable, but I believe that the measure of a good democracy is one where those who represent us in Government have the courage to put principle above personal discomfort.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">That was Tim's email. I would like to say to Tim that on this side of the House we're not afraid of scrutiny, and nor should we be as politicians in a democratic country like Australia. It's not uncomfortable to be responsible and accountable for our actions, as we should all be in this place, whether you're a politician or a bureaucrat. I wrote back to Tim saying that freedom of the press is at the core of our democratic society and is vital to holding the government to account, and Labor is committed to defending this fundamental democratic right. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It was interesting to see a coalition of Australian media organisations launching concerted campaigns known as 'Australia's Right to Know' across television networks and newspapers in Australia to push this government into lifting its veil of secrecy. We saw the print newspapers on Monday where they were blacked out. This comes as News Corp Australia and the ABC have told a Senate committee that journalists at the centre of police raids in June still don't know whether they could be criminally prosecuted. The raids happened in June, and they still have no idea whether there will be criminal charges against them, whether they'll be prosecuted and what will happen to them. As media representatives said, 'The raids have achieved a chilling effect on reporting.' It has had an effect on reporting. This is here in Australia, in a democratic country where we've always had the right to speak out. Regardless of whether you believe in something or you agree with them, we've always had that God given right to be able to speak out, to speak our minds. That is something we do not want to lose in this nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Morrison government, on this side we believe in freedom of the press and the public's right to know. Journalists should never be prosecuted or face going to jail simply for doing their jobs. Journalism isn't a crime; it's a profession. It's also an essential part of a democratic country, of our democracy here in Australia. The public has the right to know, and with that I share with you that the Labor side of politics calls on the Morrison government to rule out the prosecution of Dan Oakes, Sam Clark and Annika Smethurst and to better protect journalists whose only crime is doing their jobs and reporting the truth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We also call on the government to fully comply with its obligations under freedom of information laws and to protect a very important part of our community—that is, whistleblowers. If you think back to all of the whistleblowers who have come out and have raised issues, they've blown apart a whole range of things that we'd been kept in the dark about. We're determined to hold the government to account on this issue, and I'm grateful for people in my electorate like Tim, who wrote to me this week, and many others for sharing their concerns with me.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many other issues in the electorate, and this takes me onto Newstart and how we're saying the payment needs to be raised. When the amount of money you're receiving from Newstart is affecting you, is stopping you from looking for work, then you know there's a problem. It's quite clear that you cannot possibly be an active jobseeker putting your best foot forward if you can't afford transport, if you can't afford to pay for your mobile to make calls for interviews, if you're struggling to keep your electricity paid and food on the table. We need to alleviate some of the pressures they have in their lives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than support Newstart recipients getting ahead, this government plans to extend the liquid assets test waiting period for Newstart to up to six months. This is extremely cruel and reckless. The cuts listed for debate this week will particularly impact Australians in their 50s and 60s who have spent their entire lives working, but for some reason see their manufacturing plant or their industry being closed down. They are made redundant through no fault of their own but because of the quick changing world.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, people claiming Newstart, sickness allowance, youth allowance and Austudy must wait for up to 13 weeks to access these payments. This government wants to extend the maximum liquid assets waiting period for middle-aged and older Australians from 13 weeks to 26 weeks. If you look at the experience of middle-aged and older Australians in particular, it is so difficult to re-enter the workforce when their industries have been decimated. If you look at my state of South Australia, car manufacturing has been wiped off the face of the earth. There were approximately 1,000 workers working at GMH. We had Mitsubishi down the road. In total, there could have been 150,000 spin-off jobs. They're gone; they're finished. How do you retrain those people who have done one thing their entire lives?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The people who are being affected more than anyone else are older Australians and middle-aged Australians. These changes will force them to eat into their savings and draw down their assets and will drive them into poverty before they can access any support. We know that Australians aged over 55 represent one in four Newstart recipients. This is the largest cohort on this payment. The number of 55-year-olds on Newstart has surged by 45 per cent under this government. We've seen the reports that have come out. Our productivity is going backwards, which means there's low wage growth, and it affects everything else as well. At a time when Australians are doing it tough and the economy is weak and getting weaker, this government wants to cut support to Australians who need it the most and who are most likely to spend. When those people on very small incomes get those extra few dollars, they go straight back into the economy. They'll go into the economy to buy things that they absolutely need but perhaps couldn't afford previously.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">These cuts mean that Australians doing it tough have less to spend on basics and the essentials and perhaps less of that little bit extra for things that they need to buy. It means that they'll have less to spend at local businesses, and that has a spin-off affect where everyone suffers. These cuts to Newstart are not only cruel and vindictive; they're reckless. It's absolutely reckless to do this. This payment is designed to help people get back on their feet, not put them into a downward spiral event.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">That takes me to another area: vocational education. It's not just the jobseekers, middle-aged Australians and older Australians that are being done over; it's also those wanting to further their education. A new report reveals the government has short-changed TAFE training and apprenticeship programs by almost $1 billion, despite the fact Australia is suffering a national shortage of tradies. If you look back at all the public entities—railways, the Electricity Trust of South Australia and a whole range of other areas—at the end of the school year, they would have an intake of apprentices. I remember that when I was working as an adviser to the water minister I spoke to SA Water, which was the old EWS government enterprise, and we got some figures. When it was still in government hands, it was taking over 120 apprentices per year. When it was privatised, it went down to three a year.</span>

                </a>  It was the Liberal government in South Australia that privatised them. The federal government department's latest annual report confirms that since 2014 the Liberals have failed to spend a massive $919 million of their own TAFE and training budget, an underspend of more than 17 per cent. Apprentice and trainee programs have been the worst affected, including apprentice incentives for business, support to help people finish apprenticeships and fund design to train Australians in areas of need. The $1 billion underspend is in addition to the more than $3 billion they have already ripped out of TAFE and training. Is it any wonder that under this government our TAFEs are in disrepair and apprentice and trainee numbers have fallen off a cliff?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This government claims they really want to lift the status of vocational education in Australia, but the truth is there's a short change of nearly $1 billion in TAFE and training. That doesn't help anyone; it doesn't help businesses who require the skills and it doesn't help young Australians who want to get into trades. If the government doesn't do something to seriously look at fixing the skills crisis that has been created, we could be looking at the extinction of the Australian tradie as well. We will be bringing the people in from overseas continuously to work on building sites because we'll be claiming that we don't have the skills here in this nation. Of course you won't have the skills unless you train people up. We've got a shortage of workers in critical services, including plumbing, carpentry, hairdressing and motor mechanics. All of this is in the report. It's unheard of that we should have a shortage of plumbers, carpenters, hairdressers and motor mechanics, a job that kids aspired to get into when I was leaving school. But there are no positions. There are no training places and there is no-one taking them on. Under this government there are 150,000 fewer apprentices and trainees, so the number of Australians doing apprenticeships or traineeships is lower today than it was a decade ago.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There are more people dropping out of apprenticeships and traineeships than finishing them. Businesses are crying out for more trained staff. The Australian Industry Group says 75 per cent of businesses surveyed are struggling to find qualified workers that they need. And what are we doing about it? Nothing. There are almost two million Australians who are unemployed or underemployed, and we're not training people. We know why this government isn't training these people for jobs in industries facing skill shortages: it is because we're starving the TAFEs of needed money and training. By locking Australians out of education, we're locking Australians out of jobs. It's pretty simple. It's not rocket science. It's a pretty simple equation. You lock them out of training; you're locking them out of jobs and we're bringing people in on the skilled migration visas, where we've nearly got 800,000-odd—</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">By presiding over a skills crisis, this government are holding Australian businesses back, they're holding Australian wages back and they're holding back the lifestyle of Australians that we all dreamt about and for which we were called 'the Lucky Country' many years ago. That's gone. That title has diminished. Australians deserve good training facilities and good TAFEs and universities for those that wish to go on to universities, but both, unfortunately, have been gutted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It takes me onto the other issue: pensioners. We have good, honest people who have worked all their lives and have paid their taxes their entire lives. Some have fought in wars as well. No-one's safe from this government, not even our pensioners, who are the backbone of this country, the people who have already contributed so much for us to be able to lead the lives that we lead today. They have done the hard yards, and it's now time to allow them some relief in their twilight years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor delivered the biggest rise in the age pension in Australia's history, and the government has constantly tried to whittle away the age pension, which is in their sights for cost cutting. We know this government's history; they're obsessed with cutting the pension, having attempted to cut the pension in every single budget since they've been in government. In 2014 they tried to cut the pension indexation, a cut that would have meant pensioners would be forced to live on $80 less a week within 10 years. In 2014 they cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions support designed to help pensioners with the cost of living. Again, they axed the $900 seniors supplement for self-funded retirees receiving the Commonwealth seniors health card. In 2014 they tried to reset deeming rate thresholds, a cut that would have made half a million part pensioners worse off. And in 2015 they did a deal with the Greens to cut the pensions to around 370,000 pensioners by as much as $12,000 a year by changing the pension asset test.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016 they tried to cut the pension to around 190,000 pensioners as part of a plan to limit the overseas travel for pensioners to six weeks. What's wrong with travelling overseas? If you're a pensioner, you've worked your entire life and you've paid your taxes. That's what you want to do when you retire. But, no, they want to limit pensioners' overseas travel. In 2016 they tried to cut the pension for over 1.5 million Australians by scrapping the energy supplement for new pensioners. What a measly amount to cut. It was $40 a fortnight to help with their energy costs. People have worked all their lives and paid taxes, and what do we do? We attack them and try and take away that measly $40. The government's own figures show this would have left over 563,000 Australians who are currently receiving a pension or allowance worse off over 10 years. In excess of 1.5 million pensioners would have been worse off.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">They spent five years trying to increase the pension age to 70. It's all right if you're in an office in a managerial position, but, if you've been a bricklayer, you've worked in a factory all your life or you're on the farm or on the land, your back has gone by the time you're 50. How can you work until age 70? And the government continues with these pushes and continues to short-change pensioners with the inequitable deeming rates, while interest rates remain at record lows. We need a government that respects our pensioners. As I said, they're people who have worked all their lives and people who have paid their taxes. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, we have a waiting list of 120,000 for aged-care packages at home, and every month those figures are blowing out by another 20,000  to 30,000. We plug a hole in one place and a great big gushing hole opens in another. These are people who just want some dignity and some care at home, once they've retired. When they get into their old age they're frail, and they go on these massive waiting lists, which means they deteriorate—they haven't got the help that's required—and then they end up in aged-care facilities, which ends up costing 10 times the amount of what a home care package would have cost. Or, if they are given a home care package, it's at a very low level where it doesn't really assist them. So they wait for six months to get the package, they're then given a package which doesn't really assist them, and then they apply for another one. I've had people who have come to see me, and they have then passed away waiting for packages. When we receive the package it's too late—they're gone. Or they have older relatives looking after them who also become frail because they too have to wear the added burden of looking after and assisting their loved one. This is not on. These are people who deserve dignity in those twilight years. </span>

                <a href="HX4" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  I hope in some future time that someone might read the speeches—the ones that I make, anyway—I really do. I think if you took a survey of this parliament and asked: have they read the speech of Edward Theodore—the second reading speech to the Fiduciary Notes Bill—I doubt whether a single one of them would have even heard of it. Yet, a great Australian historian asked the Clerk of parliament, who'd sat here for 53 years listening to parliament, 'Who was the brightest fellow who ever went through this place?' The Clerk said: 'I'll answer your question this way. Theodore's second reading speech on the fiduciary notes issue was easily the most brilliant speech ever given in this place.' To this very day, it still is. If you read that speech, you understand that we don't have to be scared of recessions and depressions and runaway inflation: there is a complete and full understanding of how economics works. To know of the terrible mistakes we made in the Great Depression by not listening to Theodore and his acolytes, Chifley and Curtin, we can quote Winston Churchill, 'Those who cannot learn from history will be doomed to re-suffer it'. It's a good quote. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to tell the people of Australia and future generations that this was once a great nation, a nation to be proud of. We built our own motor car. I think my father bought the 310th Holden sold in Queensland. I remember he kept walking around it and saying: 'We Australians built this car. We Australians built this car. Look at this car. Look at it its clearance. Look how cheap it is. It hasn't got the frills of all the British rubbish. It hasn't got a big tank like the Americans. This is a car built for Australia.' He was just so proud of the Holden, Australia's own car. All this place had to do was say that all government cars will be built in Australia. That's all they had to do, and we would have a car industry today. But, no, both sides of this parliament are driven by ideology. Economic rationalism, as it's called, has replaced economic nationalism. I sit with two great pictures on my wall, one of Edward Granville Theodore and the other of 'Black Jack' McEwen. These men would turn in their graves if they saw what their parties, the Country Party and the Labor Party, had come to today—standing idly by and watching the complete destruction of the motor vehicle industry in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When McEwen was the boss, all of our petrol came from Australia. It was Australian petrol. Now, all bar three per cent of our petrol is imported from overseas. Again, I wish we taught history in our schools, because if we taught history in our schools we would know that the Japanese went to war because the Americans cut their petrol off. We would know that the European war was about Hitler trying to get to the oilfields across Africa and Russia. The whole wall was about oil! But we don't have to worry about it; we've got three weeks supply in Australia!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the lucky generation. I wasn't in the lucky generation. I joined up, because everyone was going to fight in Indonesia—we were at war with Indonesia. I don't know about other people, but I didn't join up out of any patriotism—I want to put that on the record. I joined up because I knew everyone was going to go, and if I got in early I might be giving the orders instead of taking orders. It was anything but patriotism there! But I was terrified; I was in the 49th battalion and we were on 24-hour call-up to go over there, to face off against an army nearly 27 times the size of our army. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When we faced off, we had half a million semiautomatic rifles and there were another million in private hands. I had an AK-47 and my brother had an eight-cartridge shotgun. You don't pick a fight with a country which has 1½ million people who've got semiautomatic weapons and know how to use them. That is not a good idea, even if you are the size of Indonesia or China. You don't try taking on a country like that—with Switzerland and Israel being the great examples of that. But now we have 35,000 rifles with which to defend the country. We have no petrol and we have no rifles. We have 200 drones—we're into the modern age with 200 drones—but the drones have no ordnance capacity. So we can look at the enemy but we're not allowed to hurt them, because we've got no ability to hurt them. I won't go on in that area.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Seventy per cent of our whitegoods were made in Australia. When I was a kid my television was made in Australia, the fridge was made in Australia and the stove was made in Australia. Air conditioners were just coming in then, but were made in Australia. All of our household appliances were made in Australia. I don't have to tell anyone in this parliament that none of our appliances are now made in Australia. The last whitegoods factory closed in Orange three years ago. With textiles, footwear and clothing, we've still got some textiles, footwear and clothing in Australia, but 70 per cent of them have gone.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In my homeland, the cattle and sheep industry—through enlightened, fierce and courageous government—has stood up to the big corporations. We watched Dalgety's go, Estes go, and English and Scottish go, and these places were taken over by Australians. The laws in Queensland said: you have a 30-year lease and at the end of that lease, anything over the size of a living area is cut off and balloted out to Australians. Those laws saw all of those industries in the hands of Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We built the Snowy. In Queensland we had a free hospital system—the only place on earth. You could walk in off the street at any time of day or night and get looked after. In Queensland, for those areas which were under the mining act—which was about a 10th of the state—we sold land for between $7,000 and $15,000 a block when in the cities they were $100,000 a block. When Charters Towers was moved off the mining system, the price of a housing block went from $6,000 to $72,000. We provided cheap land for our young couples so that they could get married and bring up their kids with a little bit of space around them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We built the Snowy mountains scheme, which was one of the 23-greatest engineering achievements in the history of the world. We have not built a weir or a dam in 33 years, yet the government has burnt up $1½ billion in looking at dam schemes. I am sick and tired of ministers, particularly National Party ministers, wandering around North Queensland, announcing a new dam scheme and then giving $50 million or $100 million to have a look at it, to assess it, to have an economic development statement or an environmental development statement. Heavens, if you're the government of Australia and you can't figure out whether it's a good idea to build a dam in Hughenden or not, then you should not be the government of Australia. If you have not got at your hands the knowledge about what is bad and what is good for the environment and nature in Australia then you should get out of government—33 years; nothing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">All of the ports in Australia were owned by Australians—by the Australian people not by corporations. All the electricity was owned by the Australian people—not by corporations in Australia. All of the airports were owned by Australian people. All of the gas was owned by Australian people. The mining companies, the four great mining companies in Australia—BHP, the biggest mining company in the world; MIM, the fourth-biggest mining company in the world; Western Mining; and Normandy—all were Australian owned. There are a couple of others I can't remember. Now there is not a single significant mining company in this country that is Australian owned.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the land, all I know is that the AA company; the Consolidated Pastoral Company; Kidman, the biggest farming operation in Australia; Van Diemen's dairies; and Cubbie Station, the second-biggest farming operation in Australia, are all majority owned or controlled by foreigners. There might be a question mark over one of those companies, but I would argue that all of them are owned or substantially controlled by foreign interests. There is no doubt in the mind of any of us who live in non-city Australia that the majority of the land mass of Australia is now foreign owned: 52 per cent is desert, on the world register of deserts; 22 per cent is owned by the First Australians, but they're not allowed to own anything. They've no timber rights, no quarrying rights and no water rights. Apart from that, they own the land! Tribal ownership—tribal ownership pre-dates the Roman empire, the Greek empire and the Mesopotamian empire, so we're getting them to work economically under tribal ownership, are we? That's good fun.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not stopping there. I was not comfortable with the government of John Howard bringing in 320,000 people a year into Australia. The incoming Labor government kicked that up to 650,000. I was at a CFMEU dinner the night the president of the CFMEU mercilessly attacked the Prime Minister, who was at the dinner—I'm a proud member of the union—over bringing in 650,000 people a year, and specifically the section 457 workers. There were about 37,000 coming in under the Liberal Party and 147,000 coming in under the Labor Party. They were coming in, undermining our pay and conditions and taking our jobs. To quote Sally McManus of the ACTU, one out of every two new jobs in Australia since 2013 has gone to a temporary visa holder. They say, 'Oh, yes, but they must meet award conditions.' Award conditions? I have been where they live. There are three beds stacked up on this side and three beds stacked up on that side. I measured the distance. It was from my left shoulder to the tip of my right hand. That was the distance. There were no cupboards. They had sticks and poles that they were hanging their clothes on at the back of the beds. Shared toilet facilities were 20 metres away. And these people were paying $150 a week for the rental. So, yes, they're paying award wages, and then the labour hire companies get them through the back door. If they complain, of course, there's a deportation order and they're gone. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The other intriguing thing about the 640,000 people coming to Australia is that they are coming from countries with no democracy and/or no rule of law and/or no Judaeo-Christian 'love your neighbour, make the world a better place'—we may not go to church on Sundays, but we most certainly are brought up in the Christian traditions—no industrial awards and no egalitarian traditions. So 650,000 people are coming to Australia each year and our natural birth rate is under 300,000. In fact, if you take out—God bless them—my First Australian brothers, and you take out people from the Middle East, we have the lowest birth rate of any country on earth. We are a vanishing race. When 20 Australians die, even if you include those groups, they're only replaced by 17 people. So, over five generations, we've got a population in Australia of about 12 million people. Those are not my words; they are the words of Bob Burrell, the economist and demographer. But you can work it out for yourself. You don't have to be Albert Einstein to figure that one out. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">Free hospitals? No, we don't have that anymore. We don't have an outpatients. So, if you haven't got a doctor who works after hours, too bad for you. 'Red Ted' Theodore would turn in his grave and Bjelke-Petersen would turn in his grave if they thought that there was no free hospital system in Queensland. But there's not. In Mareeba, a town of 24,000 people, we have no bulk-billing, so if you've got no bulk-billing and no outpatients, then there ain't any free hospital system. Never mind about after-hours or on the weekend—there's nothing at all. Now, how could the much-maligned Bjelke-Petersen government provide you with 24-hour service by a doctor at that hospital every hour of the day, every day of the year, and yet the current government can't supply any service at all? I'll tell you why. Because they've developed nothing, nothing at all. There's not been a single new mine opened, to my knowledge—there probably has been, but I'm not aware of one—in Queensland in the last 33 years. Heavens, we were putting down 300 kilometres of railway line every year to open up four or five mines every year. We built a major dam or a major irrigation construction weir every year for 30 years. The much-maligned Bjelke-Petersen government did that. By the way, the man died penniless; he didn't have two bob to rub together. He was only one of two people that refused to take his golden handshake, the superannuation, because he said it was morally wrong. So he died a pauper. That is the man accused of dishonesty! By the way, 'Red Ted' Theodore is also accused. He's remembered in the history books for the Mungana scandal. He is the greatest man in Australian history by a long way. I didn't say that; Malcolm Fraser said that. I didn't say that; Paul Keating said that. I tell you what, he's on my wall. For those who want to know a little bit about history, he was Clive Packer's closest friend—Kerry Packer's father. They were in business together later on. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I live in a country where there were great democratic traditions. We led the world in democracy—for example, giving women the vote and extending the vote to everyone in society, rich or poor or whatever their background. We led the world in our democratic institutions. We led the world in engineering and building the Snowy mountains scheme. We built a free hospital system which was the envy of the world. We built giant railway systems, owned by the people of Australia. Let me flick back for a moment to why the Queensland government is broke. The Queensland government is broke because they sold the railways. The railways were bringing in nearly $5 billion a year in profits, and the people of Queensland get nothing out of them because Anna Bligh sold them to buy away, building football stadiums, ring-roads around Brisbane, tunnels in the most tunnelled city on earth, and pleasure domes and hurdy-gurdies in Brisbane. Now the dust has settled and, of the $5 billion in railway profits that was coming in each year, not a cent comes in now. That's why the government of Queensland is broke. They have never opened any new mines—there's no new mining money coming in—and those industries that do exist are collapsing.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">They've managed to badmouth the Barrier Reef to a point where our tourism is down 30 per cent. We can't go near a single waterway in North Queensland because they're alive with crocodiles. That doesn't help our tourism dollar either. By a combination of all these events, our tourism is down 30 per cent. Our coalmines have all been sold overseas and no new coalmines are opening. We only have two great industries in Queensland. They are the sugarcane industry and the coal industry. Our current government believes the sugarcane industry should be closed down because it's destroying the Barrier Reef. It has been there for 150 years, and the Barrier Reef, according to David Attenborough, is one of the most pristine, pure and beauteous places on earth. That is not the song he sang when he got back to England, I might add, but it is the song he sang when he was here. Of course, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Australian Institute of Marine Science are saying the reef is in good condition.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">I look out on a horror story that, with each increasing year, will get worse and worse. People have no democratic traditions, no rule of law, no Judeo-Christian belief and no industrial awards. They will increasingly be the Australians of the future, and we, the Australians of today, will cease to exist. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
