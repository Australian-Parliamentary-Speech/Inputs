                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  The Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Protecting Consumers from Predatory Leasing Practices) Bill 2020 is a long overdue reform. Labor Senator Doug Cameron first attempted to legislate a similar proposal in 2015 and he received support from the Senate, only to have it rejected in the House of Representatives. Since that time, calls have only grown louder and louder and the evidence has grown more and more compelling about the damage that is being done by allowing consumer lease providers to access automatic deductions from social security payments through the service known as Centrepay. This bill is timely, because the uptake of the JobSeeker payment caused by unemployment during the pandemic means there are more people now with access to Centrepay and more people in the general community who are under financial pressure and vulnerable to unscrupulous behaviour and sharp practice. Time and time again we find examples of people who are locked into consumer leases that they cannot afford, paying well above market rates for goods that they will never own, yet the government continues to ignore these concerns. Action through legislation would not be necessary if the government used its power to act administratively and enforce the existing rules. We know that this government consistently fails to act when low-income and vulnerable Australians need support. They prefer to do nothing, which again and again exposes the community to predatory lending practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, and it would remove the ability for consumer lease providers to sign up recipients of social security payments and access their payments directly through the Centrepay service. The bill removes the ability for the departmental secretary to make any deductions requested by a person from their social security payment if deductions relate to goods hired under a consumer lease entered into by that person. I repeat the point I made earlier: under existing legislation, Centrelink is enabled by section 61A of the act, which provides that if a person asks the department secretary to make deductions from instalments of a social security payment payable to the person and to pay the amounts deducted to a business or an organisation nominated by the person, the secretary may make the deductions requested by that person to that nominated business. So the main provision of this bill removes the power from the department secretary to enable these deductions from a person's social security payments if those payments are about a consumer lease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth having a think about how Centrepay works. It was established back in 1998 as a budgeting and financial capability tool to assist clients of what was then known as Centrelink, now Services Australia, by paying rent and utility bills through automatic deductions from their welfare payments. More than 600,000 people use Centrepay to pay bills, rent and ongoing expenses. But the proliferation of consumer-leasing businesses as approved Centrepay service providers is contrary to the rationale of Centrepay, which was to enable people to budget and ensure that regular bills and essential living expenses were paid directly from their welfare payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of Centrepay is to support recipients with payments of their expenses, but we know that these products are exorbitantly expensive. And, given the expensive nature of consumer lease products, in nearly every case they are not suitable for people in these income brackets, and the use of this service is not in line with the purposes of Centrepay. The department actually acknowledges this; Centrepay's terms and conditions are supposed to prevent its users from being exploited by banned products. To quote from the department's own policy, banned products are those which 'have significant potential for high-cost but low-value goods or services' or those which '<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">expose customers to unacceptable risks of financial stress or exploitation</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'. </span>You couldn't imagine a descriptor that more closely aligns with the products being offered by some consumer lease providers, and it is hard to understand how Services Australia can possibly claim that many of the consumer lease providers that they have on their books right now could possibly meet this test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The payment structure of consumer leases can cost consumers so much more in the long run than an ordinary purchase would, and it can further entrench low-income individuals, who are vulnerable, in a spiral of debt. The Salvation Army observed in evidence to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee the following:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This appears contrary to the original principles of Centrepay, which we understand were to help people on low incomes with money management. In our experience a consumer lease payment is more likely to cause money management issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, Centrepay is effectively underwriting the business risks, the cash risks, for these consumer lease providers by providing them with a guaranteed payment stream. This money comes out of a Centrelink recipient's benefit as a priority payment. ASIC noted that although Centrepay lowers the risk of such a default on the payments for such providers, the evidence is that these companies charge people who are using Centrepay more than they do the general population. It is disgraceful that this persists, and it's disgraceful that it persists with the government and the department in full knowledge of the harm that it is doing to vulnerable people. By retaining consumer leases in the categories of goods and services eligible for Centrepay deductions, Centrepay is being used for the benefit of commercial interests, rather than in the interests of Services Australia clients who are making these payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centrepay has been open to access by businesses whose products, particularly consumer leases, disadvantage consumers and have the potential to cause very serious financial harm, and there is evidence that some parts of the consumer-leasing industry actively use Centrepay to prey on the financially vulnerable. Not all consumer leases are bad and not all consumer lease providers act unethically, but the government's failure to enforce its own policy means that the dodgy consumer lease providers in the market have a free pass to use Centrepay to target pensioners and welfare recipients with unfair contracts and poor-value services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Services Australia clients are subject to exorbitant interest charges, in some cases over 800 per cent. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has found that the cost of household goods leased from rent-to-buy businesses can cost nearly nine times as much as the retail price of those same goods. ASIC also found, as I mentioned, that the lessors often charge higher amounts to recipients of social security payments than they advertise to other customers. And, at the end of the lease and after all that expense, the consumer does not even own the goods. Between 2013 and 2018, ASIC's enforcement against some of these businesses resulted in fines and community benefit payments of $3.4 million, and remediation to consumers through refund and debt write-offs of almost $27 million. If that is not evidence of sharp practice, of exploitative practice, of practice that is not consistent with Services Australia's own policy, it is hard to know what evidence would be necessary to have this hapless department actually act on these harmful products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill follows significant campaigns by the advocates, by the non-government organisations, who are calling for further action on payday loans and consumer leases. It follows investigation after investigation by Senate committees on this issue. The 2019 report of the Senate Economics References Committee's inquiry into credit and financial services targeted at Australians at risk of financial hardship found that the benefit of consumer lease providers being registered with Centrepay is very clear: automatic deductions reduce the default for companies while also allowing them to charge the consumer for products well above the cost of the product.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thorn Group, the parent company of Radio Rentals, noted that 52 per cent of its customers paid via Centrepay. The damage that occurs through Centrepay's deductions, because they are automatically taken out, is that payments for consumer leases are prioritised for Services Australia clients ahead of paying for things that they really need—basic goods or services like childcare. The Consumer Credit Legal Service of Western Australia told a Senate committee hearing in March 2020 that in Meekatharra community workers told them of issues that the community faces with community leases. The evidence was this, and it is disgusting: many of the sales are unsolicited. They drive around in a grey RAV, park in the street and entice passers-by to sign up. The consumer lease provider charges hundreds of dollars in delivery fees, which are also paid for from Centrepay deductions. In one case, a person mistakenly received brand new furniture meant for somebody else, then the consumer lease provider attempted to deliver that later to the correct person. However, that person no longer wanted the furniture as it had been used, and the consumer lease provider demanded that that person pay $8,000 for the furniture. But despite this, and despite countless other examples, Services Australia refuses to enforce its own policy. That policy is supposed to prohibit products that are financially exploitative. But Services Australia continues to allow the worst consumer lease providers to access vulnerable customers via Centrepay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are alternatives. Certain types of household goods, rental or consumer leases and other types of financial products, including short-term loan repayments to cash lenders, payday lenders and pawn brokers are already excluded from Centrepay, and this bill will ensure that Centrepay is prospectively closed to all consumer leasing companies for the same reason it is closed to payday lenders in these products. The prohibition contained in this bill will apply prospectively, meaning no individual who has entered into a consumer lease agreement using Centrepay will be required to terminate their lease as a result of the legislation, and the legislation will only prevent consumer lease agreements using Centrepay from being made in the future. If enacted, there are other payment options that would still be available to people wanting to purchase household goods. People would have the option of paying for their goods by direct credit card, bank transfer or other payment services. And Services Australia clients also have the option of signing up for a fee-free basic bank account that can let them set up and cancel a direct debit with a different service provider, including a consumer lease provider, free of charge. They wouldn't be charged an overdraw fee if they made a payment, transfer or direct debit when there was insufficient or no money in their account. But for many low-income people, the best option may be to utilise microfinance programs such as the no income loan scheme. If you're experiencing hardship and you're listening to this, I would always suggest seeing a financial counsellor who can provide independent and free advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll conclude now by saying this: Labor first introduced legislation to remove consumer leases from Centrepay in 2015 and our legislation was supported at that time in this place. Since that time, the need for change has only grown. Government members of the Economics Legislation Committee have supported excluding consumer lease providers from Centrepay, so I look forward to them backing up that commitment today by voting for this bill. Labor is once taking the initiative to ensure that this service cannot be used by consumer lease providers to exploit Australians on low incomes and, for these reasons, the bill should be passed.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Protecting Consumers from Predatory Leasing Practices) Bill 2020. This bill is necessary because the government have failed to act. They have failed to take the necessary measures to protect low-income and financially vulnerable Australians from these predatory practices. This bill provides that the secretary may not make any deductions requested by a person from their social security payments if the deductions relate to goods hired under a consumer lease entered into by that person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centrepay was set up to help people receiving income support payments to pay their rent and essential bills through automatic deductions from their payments. This has clearly been abused by consumer lease providers in predatory lending practices. It has been reported on in this place, in committee inquiries and through a range of community service organisations who see their clients impacted, or adversely affected, by these predatory practices. The government won't act. In this case, it's up to Labor, which has brought this bill, to act. We have also raised this issue many, many times. It's absolutely outrageous that Services Australia—and, before that, the Department of Human Services—have not used their powers to ensure that these practices are not continued. It's very, very clear that these predatory companies are deliberately targeting vulnerable Australians on income support knowing very well that Centrepay will prioritise their payment. So it's a guaranteed source of income at absolutely outrageous interest rates. Centrepay should not be used to facilitate these appalling practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are many Australians on income support payments who suffer financial harm after entering into consumer leases that deduct payments through Centrepay. When consumer lease providers are able to access individuals' income support payments via Centrepay, this often results in significant financial harm. People are locked into high-cost, low-value products, which expose consumers to an unacceptable risk of financial stress or exploitation. Consumer lease providers often employ predatory tactics to target vulnerable Australians who are doing it tough, particularly financially. Consumer leases come with huge fees and interest rates that often exacerbate financial hardship. For example, a consumer lease for a baby cot and mattress from Direct Appliance Rentals costs $4,368 over 24 months, compared to only $1,487 if purchased direct from the retailer. That's nearly three times the cash price of goods—all payable via Centrepay, apparently with no questions asked by Services Australia. That's fine—no questions asked. This means that payments are made before income reaches the person's bank account. Nobody should be forced to prioritise repayments for expensive consumer leases ahead of paying for essentials like food and housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Consumer Action Law Centre have witnessed consumer lease providers restart Centrepay deductions after consumers have cancelled payments without obtaining the customer's consent. They have also assisted consumers who have suffered harassment as a result of cancelling deductions, or who have had consumer lease providers continue to deduct payments through Centrepay after the relevant contracts have finished. How is that possible? Where is Services Australia? They are negligent in regard to this issue. It's been raised time and time again in this chamber and, as I said, in committee inquiries and in estimates. We were told this wasn't happening anymore; they were going to take care of it. Clearly, they have not taken care of it. The Commonwealth Ombudsman recently agreed with complaints brought forward by the Consumer Action Law Centre that Services Australia weren't adequately enforcing their own policies against consumer lease providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You have to ask why. Is it just because they haven't got enough staff that are able to do this—to provide this sort of oversight and to ensure that the rip-offs of people aren't happening? Or is it because they're turning a blind eye to these sorts of outrageous lending practices? This bill is necessary because Services Australia has failed—again and again and again—to respond to breaches of its own policies by consumer lease providers, therefore leaving vulnerable Australians open to exploitation. In other words, a government department is basically facilitating these rip-offs. By failing to implement their own policies, they are facilitating the rip-off, on a massive scale, of vulnerable Australians trying to survive on income support, and we all know how poor—outside of the COVID supplement—these payments are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centrepay access is not needed by people to obtain household goods through consumer leases, as there are other payment options available that enable people to make regular payments. If consumer leases were removed from Centrepay, people would still have the option of paying for their goods by direct debit, credit card, bank transfer, POLi or signing for fee-free basic bank accounts that do not charge default or overdraft fees. They can also apply for an interest-free loan. These are options that are obviously not explained by these consumer lease providers when they are trying to flog people these products. Because they know that if they go through Centrepay, they're not going to get pinged by Services Australia, and they can simply rip these customers off by three times—or, as we heard earlier from Senator McAllister—up to eight times the fees. These are appalling practices, and, if the government were doing the right thing, we wouldn't need to be standing in this chamber talking about it time and time again—if Services Australia were doing the job it's supposed to be doing. I think they forget that, actually, their job is to help vulnerable Australians, not to facilitate rip-offs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens support this bill. We think it's way past time that people on income support were protected from these predatory practices. It is appalling that action has not been taken earlier on this issue. </span>

I'm very pleased that Senator McAllister has introduced it into this place, and I only wish that the government would either support the bill or act to deal with the exploitation that Services Australia is facilitating. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centrepay is designed and was originally set up to help low-income people manage their finances, not to facilitate the mining of profits from the household incomes of some of the most vulnerable people in Australia. More than 600,000 Australians use Centrepay to pay bills, rent and ongoing expenses through automatic deductions. It's a sound proposition, but it has been open to access by businesses whose products—particularly consumer leases—disadvantage consumers and have the potential to cause great harm to Australian families who should have the government's support. About 10 per cent of payments made through Centrepay are for consumer leases. One dollar in every $10 goes to these operations, which largely exploit vulnerable Australians. Consumer leases are an underacknowledged, underregulated and misunderstood cousin of payday loans. They're marketed to the same people—poor people struggling to get by—and they make their money from the same ruthless exploitation. Consumer leases are subject to responsible lending obligations, but there's no maximum cost of a consumer lease. Almost every time, the consumer will pay far more than the cash value of the goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Services Australia clients are sometimes subject to exorbitant interest charges—in some cases over 800 per cent—and Services Australia says, 'There's nothing to see here.' They sign off on these propositions and allow the money to be deducted out of people's accounts without a second look. ASIC has found that household goods leased from rent-to-buy businesses can cost nearly nine times the retail price of the same goods. With every consumer lease payment arranged through Centrepay, the government effectively endorses these practices. Our social security system should be supporting people, not endorsing a business model that creates poverty traps that many ordinary Australians can't find their way out of. The government is facilitating predatory lending and leasing practices that rip away money and take food off the kitchen tables of some of our most vulnerable families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would ensure that Centrepay is prospectively closed to consumer leasing companies for the same reasons that Centrepay is closed to payday lenders. There are safer payment options. They include no-interest loans from microfinance organisations. There are other payment services that are better regulated to avoid poverty traps, direct debit arrangements, credit card arrangements and bank transfer arrangements, all designed to support people making large purchases from a low-income base without being ripped off by predatory interest rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A similar bill to ban Centrepay for consumer leases, which was introduced by my predecessor Senator Doug Cameron in 2015, was the only private member's bill to pass the Senate in the 44th Parliament, with every crossbench vote. During that debate, coalition senators consistently said that there was no need for such a bill because their government was working with regulators and the Department of Human Services to stop exploitative consumer leases. Five years later, contracts continue to be signed and they continue to get the stamp of approval from the Morrison government. Five years later, the government simply haven't done enough. They are always on the side of big banks, not on the side of ordinary people. In this case, they are always on the side of some of the most predatory, unscrupulous operators in the market and never on the side of low-income families.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have consistently advocated on this side for greater protections for consumers in response to consistent concerns about improper behaviour by consumer lease providers and payday lenders. I want to congratulate Senator Jenny McAllister for bringing this bill to this place and for doing the work that's required: talking to the advocacy organisations, talking to ordinary Australians and talking to people in the finance sector to develop a bill that's capable of resolving the problem that is so manifest for so many hundreds of thousands of Australians.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a hypocrite! That's exactly what the government does when it comes to other legislation that's before this house this week. In government senators' dissenting report to the Senate Economics References Committee report <span style="font-style:italic;">Credit and financial services targeted at Australians at risk of financial hardship</span>, Senator Hume said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Coalition Senators wish to emphasise that Centrepay is free and voluntary. It helps individuals to budget, and people can start, change or cancel their Centrepay deductions at any time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it goes for these consumer lease programs. There are already millions of Australians in deep financial trouble on this government's watch. A million Australians are unemployed—we'll peak at eight per cent next year; 2.4 million Australians are unemployed or underemployed; wage growth has stalled for the life of this government, not just this year but at historic lows for the life of this government; and the wage share of national income is at record lows.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, the recession has hurt those who completed year 12 but who do not have a university degree, workers born in non-English-speaking countries and older Australians. Are these people really free to make voluntary financial decisions? Look at the early access superannuation scheme, much trumpeted by the government in their vain effort to undermine industry superannuation. APRA's data from 22 November shows that 3.4 million Australians applied to the government's early release super scheme—their average release was $8,400—and 1.4 million Australians applied for a repeat amount, and their average release was $7,400. The total amount of money released was $35½ billion. Treasury estimates that this will rise to $42 billion by the end of the year. Note for comparison that the 2020-21 budget has only $25 billion in direct COVID-19 support measures, according to KPMG.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After taking into account inflation and the cost of living, a 25-year-old who withdraws $20,000 will be between $80,000 and $100,000 worse off in retirement. A 35-year-old who withdraws $20,000 will be at least $65,000 worse off. A total of 590,000 superannuation accounts have been drained to zero. Almost all were those of workers under 35. Senator Hume said, 'For many people who've made that decision, they know that there's a trade off, but they have made the decision to take that money today because they need to pay bills and pay down their mortgages.' It's a choice she will never have to make, a choice she is incapable of understanding. She went on to say, 'That might be a better financial decision for their personal balance sheet to take that money today rather than lock it up for the future.' It's free, it's voluntary but it's robbing Australians, especially young Australians, of a decent retirement to serve the ideological interests of those opposite.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party is incapable of understanding the position that low-income families are in and incapable of understanding the choices that they must make day to day, and what those opposite are doing every step of the way is making those choices harder and pushing people on a sort of 'path determinacy' towards more poverty, less resources, fewer choices and more misery for low-income families.</span>

That's why they voted 26 times to oppose the banking royal commission. Always on the side of the big banks, never on the side of ordinary people, in this case they are on the side of some of the worst creatures in Australian financial services, the people who make ordinary working-class low-income Australians pay eight times the value of a consumer good and rip that money out of people's pockets, facilitated by the government. When confronted with the banking royal commission, the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, said it was nothing more than a populist whinge. He went on to say that the Labor Party was playing reckless political games with one of the core pillars of our economy. He said the only product of that approach could be to undermine confidence in the banking and financial system. What hypocrisy from the guy who was out there after the banking royal commission waving his finger and tut-tutting. The real approach of this government has never been to be on the side of ordinary Australians. It's why they are so determined to abolish responsible lending obligation laws, introduced by Labor after the GFC, which will free up banks to aggressively push credit onto their customers.</span>

Total debts are $721 million, with 470,000 of them and 370,000 people affected. Not only do the coalition support dodgy financial schemes that prey on the poorest Australians; they created one, and it was illegal. The current line that income averaging was the issue is a fig leaf for a system that forced Centrelink recipients to prove they didn't have a debt, not the other way round. It caused immense suffering family by family—370,000 families—immense suffering.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="ZN4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  It's my pleasure to rise and speak on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Protecting Consumers from Predatory Leasing Practices) Bill 2020. Before I speak about this bill, I just want to make some general responses to Senator Ayres's contribution, which I found to be highly offensive and which wholly misrepresented the government's actions that it has taken in so many respects to protect low-income earners across this country. We actually, in this country, have one of the most generous welfare systems in the world. Senator Ayres's attempts to misrepresent the fine work of our government in caring for those who most need our help is most offensive. There was even a ridiculous comment about 'draining superannuation accounts' when we have given Australians the ability to take some of their superannuation during this shocking year, the year of the coronavirus pandemic—and this has been highly welcomed by so many Australians. I'm not going to stand here and accept Labor's attempts to set up some sort of class warfare. I am incredibly proud of our government's work to support low-income earners, particularly when I look at the work of this government this year: JobSeeker, JobKeeper, JobTrainer—the most massive amount of investment in Australians to get them through the coronavirus pandemic, in excess of $500 billion. We have stepped up, and we have stood side by side with all Australians during this very difficult year. It is quite telling that Senator Ayres never actually mentioned any of this in his contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to explain the reasons why the government does not support this private member's bill that is before the Senate this morning. If this bill were passed, it would impact Centrelink customers who want to use consumer leases and who want to use Centrepay as their preferred method of payment. To give a couple of facts, currently there are 94,000 customers, or 14 per cent of customers, who use Centrepay to manage the purchase of goods using consumer leases. The value of Centrepay deductions for consumer leases represents nine per cent of all deductions made. It's really important to reiterate that entering into any consumer lease arrangement is voluntary. Using Centrepay to pay for a consumer lease is an important right of all Centrelink recipients. Deductions from a customer's payment via Centrepay can cease at any time, although this does not cease any obligations, of course, under the consumer lease that has been signed. Customers have to provide informed consent before a deduction arrangement using Centrepay can be put in place. So there are a whole range of safeguards in relation to attempts to utilise Centrepay in some sort of improper way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All consumer lease businesses currently accessing Centrepay must have other payment options available, such as BPAY, cash or credit card. To help protect customers and not unduly restrict their access to finance, Centrepay only allows consumer leases covered by the regulatory framework under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, and that is a point that's not been made properly by those opposite. The regulatory framework is a very important safeguard which requires consumer lease businesses to be licensed and comply with responsible lending obligations overseen by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC. Businesses that use Centrepay need to comply and act in accordance with the Centrepay policy and terms, and consumer protection laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015, Services Australia made changes to protect customers by removing unregulated consumer lease businesses from Centrepay. Services Australia employs a range of measures to further protect Centrepay customers and ensure businesses meet their obligations under Centrepay terms and conditions, such as ongoing compliance activity and regular monitoring. It's also important to point out that many Centrelink customers have limited access to microfinance. So, if there is an emergency, such as the need to replace a fridge, a Centrelink customer can use consumer leases to address that issue quickly. They can then choose whether and how to make those regular payments using, of course, Centrepay. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government takes its responsibility to consumers very seriously. Centrepay is a free and voluntary service which allows people to pay bills and expenses as regular deductions from their Centrelink payments. People can start, change or cancel their Centrepay deductions at any time. To help protect customers and not unduly restrict their access to finance, as I've made very clear, there are very important safeguards included in access to Centrepay arrangements. It is a very important bill-paying service to support income support customers. Mostly, the Centrepay mechanism is used for housing and utilities costs, so obviously this is a very, very important scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since it was introduced in 1999, Centrepay has grown and expanded into more than just a means of paying a bill. In the last five years, 46 per cent of all Centrelink customers have used Centrepay for more than one service reason, suggesting it is actually used as a financial management tool. It's used actively by government and non-government entities, including the likes of state governments for court fine repayments or not-for-profits offering low- and no-interest loans. The categories of goods and services approved for Centrepay include a cost for accommodation, education and employment, health, utilities, household goods, travel and transport, social and recreational purposes, legal and professional services and financial products. So Centrepay is a very important mechanism to assist customers in managing expenses which are consistent with the purpose of welfare payments and which have the effect of reducing financial risk and also supporting financial management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2019-20 year an average of 648,000 customers per month used the service to make 26 million Centrepay deductions worth $2.76 billion to approximately 14,000 approved businesses. Around 75 per cent of the moneys disbursed through Centrepay are for accommodation and utilities. This is the core foundation of Centrepay—that it is voluntary and designed for regular ongoing deductions. I will also make the very important point that it is since 2001 that consumer leases for household goods have been allowed under Centrepay. It is only in the last couple of years that Labor has decided that this is an issue. For all those years Labor was in power, it never took any appropriate action—one can only assume because it didn't see that there was the need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015 the then Department of Human Services introduced the new Centrepay policy and terms that excluded unregulated consumer leases for household goods and also funeral insurance. So we understood where Australians were being improperly targeted and we took that action. Unregulated leases are those exempt under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act and are less than four months or indefinite in their duration. Due to the gap in accessibility for some customers to access microfinance and money for emergency, regulated consumer leases remained on Centrepay as a viable option. I think that's really important. This is not necessarily the first port of call. Anyone engaging in any sort of consumer lease does need to be properly informed, and there are appropriate mechanisms to ensure that that happens. But payday lenders, short-term loan repayments to cash lenders, pawnbrokers and buy-now pay-later schemes like Afterpay are excluded from Centrepay and have never had access to Centrepay. That's a really important safeguard. We understand that there are some operators in the market which are predatory and which will try to take advantage of more vulnerable Australians. That's why the likes of payday lenders, short-term loan repayments to cash lenders and pawnbrokers do not have access to Centrepay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'll tell you who does have access to Centrepay: the Good Shepherd Microfinance no-interest loan scheme. It commenced using Centrepay for repayment of these loans in 2001. The Good Shepherd Microfinance scheme is a wonderful scheme. There are also no-interest loans provided by other welfare or not-for-profit organisations like the Salvos or St Vincent de Paul, and they also use Centrepay. So anyone who does need to access low-interest or no-interest loans because of an emergency or because of a dire need should absolutely look to these very credible providers to ensure that they get the best deal in the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important to reiterate that Services Australia undertakes assessment of business applications for Centrepay and compliance audits of approved businesses. That's why that category of lenders is excluded. It's because the compliance work is done and we make sure that those safeguards are put in place. Approved businesses must meet and maintain essential criteria. And they're tough; the criteria are tough. The assessment process needs to consider whether the business conducts its operations in a manner that is lawful, ethical and does not take unfair advantage of customers. It needs to consider the past behaviour of the business and the business representatives; information provided by regulatory bodies, consumers, consumer groups or law enforcement agencies; previous dealings with the business; and complaints made against the business. So the bottom line is that where there is a provider which has a poor or dubious record or has engaged in improper conduct—including conduct which may have given rise to issues under the law—then Centrepay will not approve them. But, if there is a credible organisation, why should Australians be denied access to consumer leases and using Centrepay to manage their repayments for those emergency items? Otherwise, many Australians could be placed in a position that is even more vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make the point that, where a business breaches Centrepay policies—including other laws and regulations—the agency will review the business and reconsider its ongoing approval for Centrepay. So, once a Centrepay provider is approved, it doesn't stop there. There is an ongoing obligation to ensure that all businesses which provide a Centrepay option are acting in the best interests of consumers. In the 2019-20 financial year, 326 compliance audits were completed. The Centrepay policy and terms retain the discretion for Services Australia to not approve or to suspend or withdraw the approval of a business if, in its opinion, the business or representatives have not conducted or are not likely to conduct themselves in a lawful manner, have failed to comply with the Centrepay framework or are, obviously, subject to investigation or where other enforcement proceedings are brought against them. They're just some of the reasons. So Services Australia is playing a very important role to safeguard consumers. Those are many of the reasons why the government does not support this bill.</span>

To take a leaf out of Senator Henderson's book, I'll take exception to some of the comments that have been made from the other side in the same way that she made them about Senator Ayres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She did manage to reference ASIC. ASIC has found that household goods leased from rent-to-buy businesses can cost nearly nine times the retail price of the same goods. So, in that environment, where you pointed to the regulator and said, 'They're over it; they're across it; people can't go astray here,' the contribution from ASIC is that it's probably going to cost you 800 per cent more if you go down this path of rent to buy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's really instructive that the other comment was about superannuation and how the government has done everybody an enormous favour by allowing them to access their superannuation early. To be fair, it has given them cash in their pockets today, this week or this month, but it has taken a substantial chunk out of their pockets at retirement. It has reduced the potential lump sum exponentially. It has reduced their retirement expectation exponentially. And, if you're a welfare recipient, it may well have compromised your ability to actually get welfare. If you have a remaining amount in your bank account, that would be listed as an asset and may well complicate your access to Centrelink and the like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that had an algorithm and that went out there and punished enormous numbers of people. Indeed, there may even have been some suicides and the like from the pressure that was put on people with the government's algorithm. They backed off and paid $1.2 billion in compensation. Why haven't they got an algorithm to have a bit of a tickle around here and see who is providing the best value for money in this space? I accept that, if it's 40 degrees and you haven't got a fridge, you're going to get one somehow. You're going to rent, borrow or buy one, or perhaps use an untoward means of getting it. If your children haven't got a cold drink of water or milk, you're going to get a fridge. You're not going to sit back and say: 'What is the best way of doing that? Will I get three quotes?' No, you'll get a fridge within a day. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be fair. I have had little experience in this space. I've been encouraged by the contributions of Senator Siewert, Senator McAllister and Senator Pratt to go out and do a bit of digging. If you go and get a briefing from a Centrelink social worker, they'll tell you some really interesting things. I have had briefings in areas of Adelaide which are chronically underprivileged, where there are three generations of unemployed people. One contribution has never, ever gone out of my head. A social worker told me, 'Senator, we're really worried about the grandmothers.' I said 'The grandmothers?' They said, 'Yes, because 16 and 16 makes 32, and we have people here on welfare who are 33 years old and are already grandmothers.' Some of them made a bad decision once, or not a bad decision but a decision that affected their whole life: they had a child at 16. That precluded them from continuing their education or entering into useful work, and sometimes that goes on and on generationally. The social worker said: 'We really worry about the people that are facing another 30 years of Centrelink. They don't make good decisions; they need education.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I came across a constituent who had had a successful career in business and ended up doing some good work at a bank and at an air services company. When he retired he went and volunteered for the Good Shepherd organisation. He went into homes, examined budgets, gave counselling and pointed the way forward. The no-interest loan scheme is incredibly good. He explained it by saying, 'We look at people's finances and tell them that there are other ways of doing it.' He tells them: 'We need to clear that debt and then you can go and buy the washing machine of your choice, the fridge of your choice and the TV of your choice. But we need to do some really hard work first and we need to get you in a position where you can get a thousand dollars to go out and do a bit of shopping.' He would then say to them: 'Go out into the marketplace but don't commit. Come back to me and we'll have a look at your circumstances, your budget and your situation and we'll try and get you on a path to success.' Some people are very successful at this. They appreciate the experience of learning from their budget, going into the marketplace and getting quotes. There is a great organisation, The Good Guys, that looks at this space and says, 'What everybody else does we'll do better.' They have a relationship with no-interest loan providers. People actually learnt from the experience. They learnt that it was expensive to rent to buy. They learnt that it was expensive in these other areas and they became much more successful and very proud of their own achievements, because they are actually budgeting and making decisions about their life instead of reacting to what was happening in their life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Full credit to the not-for-profits in this no-interest loan area. This government should be giving them more money. If you are really serious about getting people off welfare, you need to let them control their life, and the key to controlling your life is being able to budget. Even on a meagre subsistence allowance like a Centrelink payment, being able to budget is the key to re-entry to the workforce, re-entry to education and a better life. Let's be fair: these people don't have a lot of support. If they had the family support that I'm fortunate enough to be able to provide or that my son and daughter are fortunate enough to be able to provide, people wouldn't get too far away from education, contribution to the economy and success. But these people are not in that situation. There are areas in Australia, well known, well documented, where people are subsisting. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this government could take a robodebt attitude and try and bang out big bills all around the country, if it could take a slightly less adventurous but perhaps a more private equity approach and put a small amount of money, even $100 million, into no-interest loans and run an algorithm and see that it is successful, then perhaps it could even rejuvenate some of these areas. What we do know is that, worldwide, women, in particular, are incredibly good and successful at managing small loans. It's been proven in Pakistan, India and many developing countries that, if you give women who have responsibility for children and the family a small amount of money, they will become productive. They can articulate it, work it out and go forward with a reasonable degree of success. Unfortunately, there are many areas in Australia where underprivilege is embedded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought Senator Henderson's contribution, when she referred to ASIC, was hilarious. Isn't it Telstra that's just been found to have used predatory pricing in Indigenous communities? Isn't it Telstra that has been found to have sold mobile phone plans that were incredibly overpriced and disadvantageous to Indigenous Australia? Where's ASIC in that space? Are they having a look? I think it's a free-for-all. I don't accept Senator Henderson's contribution that these people are on the job, looking at protecting Indigenous communities and looking at protecting welfare recipients from predatory behaviour. If it's the case that ASIC has found that these rent-to-buy businesses can charge nearly nine times the retail price for the cost of goods, then the only people who would enter that space are those who are completely vulnerable or completely desperate. No-one would knowingly go and pay nine times the price of an article in the marketplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've got here is a party that is opposing what I think is quite a sensible proposal to look carefully at who has access to Services Australia clients to make sure that they're not being preyed upon. It's pretty straightforward. It's not rocket science. I'm struggling to understand how anybody could actually support rent-to-buy schemes. It's incredible. If we were really serious about Centrelink and social security recipients, we would be giving them some free financial advice. We would be encouraging more not-for-profits. We should be stacking this area with more finance. We should measure it very carefully to work out exactly what does work: what contribution in what area is capable of moving people onto a better pathway? One of my constituents told me: 'This is really good work. You can get a great deal of satisfaction out of moving people incrementally towards an education pathway or into the workforce through a proper budget in the home. These people want no less than anybody else. I don't blame them for making poor decisions, because, if I didn't have a TV and I was on Centrelink payments and someone said, 'You can have one for seven bucks a week,' I'd be there, just like anybody else would be, and I'd count the cost later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the contribution from the other side is thin. When you look at the superannuation area, people are being told, 'You can have 20,000 grand now,' and those most in need of it will take it. I accept that. But they kick themselves an own goal on a lower lump sum or a lower retirement future. If they do it in as a Centrelink recipient and it reduces their ability to claim a payment—which is a bit of a contest at the moment—they've doubly kicked an own goal. The government doesn't tell them any of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summation, I really do think that everybody should support this area. When you meet social workers at Centrelink and get briefings, you see that people are struggling and they need more help. The help they need is not just another handout; they need to be lifted up the ladder. The help they need is to have a proper household budget, to be able to identify previous mistakes and not make them again, and to be offered no-interest loans to get them into a space that will allow them to take pride in their home, their children and their education. I cannot get the contribution from that social worker in the northern suburbs of Adelaide out of my head. They said: 'We're really worried about the grandmothers, because they face a lifetime on Centrelink payments, never having had a decent education and never having had the opportunity to contribute in a decent job, and all because they arguably made a poor decision when they were very young and vulnerable, or someone made that decision and then abandoned them.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've really got to do better in this space, and I don't know why we would argue about a product that can cost nine times an item's value being unsuitable for people who can barely afford to pay for their food, clothing and rent. Why would we argue about that? But we are. We hear the contributions from those on the other side, including Senator Henderson, from whom, frankly, I expected a more considered and more meaningful contribution, because her public persona and reputation is that she's a fair-minded person. The defence of this stuff really intrigues me. To defend it when their own policeman on the job, ASIC, found it can cost nine times an item's value is completely mystifying. I suppose that's politics and that's what keeps this place going round and round, but, if we're going to make a difference in this space, I think we have to be completely innovative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm probably a heretic on my side too, because I don't accept that people should be allowed to live their lives on Centrelink payments. I think there should be some strong responsibilities to the community. I know that if we took a more private equity approach to this space, where we became more adventurous and less risk averse, we would probably move a lot of people off Centrelink payments, and we should move a lot of people off them. We do know, from worldwide experience, that small loans, particularly to women with families, are a very successful way of creating empowerment and creating better educational opportunities and better outcomes financially, because people are intrinsically smart enough and determined enough to feed their families and be successful. My advice to any government would be that you do no-interest loans to get people back to square. You fund that area and get people back on the books, and then you look at moving them, through proper financial advice, proper advice about education and proper advice about how to get into the job market. You'd do that exponentially, because it is no life on Centrelink payments. It isn't a life where you can take a trip away. You're stuck in a repeating cycle of debt and bills to pay from the next contribution. Welfare recipients have fewer decisions in respect of their autonomy and the life that they should be able to lead, because there are no funds to do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So my contribution would be: pass this bill and then get to work on making the whole thing better by taking more of a private equity approach. Do some innovative projects in this space, measure how many people you get back into education and back into work, and work at reducing the taxpayer bill in this area, because we can do it if we work collegiately and responsibly together.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="264449" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  I rise to address the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Protecting Consumers from Predatory Leasing Practices) Bill 2020, which the government will not be supporting today. If passed, this bill would adversely impact Centrelink customers wanting to engage in a consumer lease and prevent them from using Centrepay as their preferred payment method.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleague Senator Henderson has outlined, Centrepay was introduced in 1999 as a bill-paying service to help Australians on income support to pay for housing and utilities costs. Centrepay helps welfare recipients to manage their expenses for priority services and goods and reduces financial risk for clients by allowing for regular deductions to be made from their welfare payments. During 2019-20, an average of 648,000 customers per month used the service to make deductions from their welfare payments to pay their bills. It is important to note that Centrepay can only be used to pay for approved services and to approved businesses. Bill expenses range from accommodation, education and training expenses to health, household utility expenses, transport, legal services and household goods. The vast majority, around 75 per cent, of the deductions made through Centrepay are for accommodation and utilities expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2001, consumer leases for household goods have been allowed under Centrepay. Many Centrelink customers have limited access to microfinance, and the provision since 2001 gives them greater options to make essential household purchases. For example, if an essential household item, such as a fridge or washing machine, breaks down, a Centrelink customer can use consumer leases to purchase a new appliance quickly and easily. The option is available for them to engage in a consumer lease. The Centrelink customer has a choice whether they want to arrange for regular payments for the lease, including if they want to use Centrepay as a way of making payments on their purchase. Deductions for a customer's payment via Centrepay can cease at any time, although this does not cease any obligations under the consumer lease that they have signed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inclusion of consumer leases since 2001 has given consumers a viable option to purchase essential household goods when access to microfinance and money may be difficult to secure. There are 94,000 customers who are making use of Centrepay to manage the purchase of their goods using consumer leases, but, as I've said, if passed, this bill we are debating here today would impact those Centrelink customers who want to use consumer leases and who want to use Centrepay as their preferred payment method.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that a number of changes have been adopted since 2001 to better protect Centrelink customers using Centrepay. In 2015 new Centrepay policies and terms were introduced by the then Department of Human Services to exclude unregulated consumer leases for household goods and funeral insurance. In early 2017 all unregulated leases were removed from Centrepay. To help protect consumers and not unduly restrict their access to finance, Centrepay only allows consumer leases covered by the regulatory framework under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The regulatory framework requires consumer lease businesses to be licensed and to comply with responsible lending obligations overseen by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, or ASIC. Businesses that use Centrepay need to comply and act in accordance with the Centrepay policy and terms and consumer protection laws. As my colleague Senator Henderson said earlier, these are incredibly important safeguards for those Centrelink customers using Centrepay, contrary to what those on the opposition benches might have been contributing in debate this morning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Services Australia undertakes assessment of business applications for Centrepay and compliance audits of approved businesses. This is another safeguard that is in place regarding this policy. Approved businesses must meet and maintain essential criteria. The assessment process may consider whether the business conducts its operations in a manner that is lawful, ethical and does not take unfair advantage of customers; the past behaviour of the business and business representatives; information provided by regulatory bodies, consumers, consumer groups and law enforcement agencies; previous dealings with the business; and any complaints made against the business. Most identified noncompliance is remedied as part of the review process. If a business is unable to remedy the identified non-compliance concerns in addressing the criteria I've just outlined, they are either partially or fully suspended from the Centrepay program until they comply or until a decision is made by the agency to withdraw their Centrepay approval.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst businesses are required to meet the Centrepay policy and terms they are also regulated through their industry's legislation and relevant regulators, such as ASIC and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, or the ACCC, as it is usually known. The agency considers any noncompliance or active investigations with these regulatory bodies and, where notified, will review the business's ongoing approval. Where a business breaches Centrepay policies, including other laws and regulations, the agency will review the business and reconsider its ongoing approval for Centrepay. So again there are some important safeguards in place to ensure that the businesses that Centrelink customers are dealing with under Centrepay are behaving appropriately and are not taking advantage of their customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the government takes its responsibilities to consumers very seriously, but this bill proposed by Labor today would only reduce the payment options available to Centrelink customers to pay for household items. This would have an adverse impact on customers where an essential item, such as a fridge or washing machine, needs to be replaced as a matter of urgency. The option to engage in a consumer lease has given consumers a viable option to purchase essential household goods when access to microfinance and other financial money streams may be difficult to secure. The Centrelink customer has a choice as to whether they want to arrange for regular payments for the lease, including if they want to use Centrepay as a way of making payments on their purchase. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, in 2015 new Centrepay policy and terms were introduced which excluded unregulated consumer leases. To help protect customers and not unduly restrict their access to finance, Centrepay only allows consumer leases covered by the regulatory framework under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. The regulatory framework requires consumer lease businesses to be licensed and comply with responsible lending obligations overseen by ASIC. Services Australia undertakes assessments of business applications for Centrepay and compliance audits of approved businesses. Like I said, the government takes its responsibilities to consumers very seriously, none more so than in the space of Centrepay, where, as I've outlined today and as my colleague Senator Henderson has outlined and as I suspect other colleagues will also detail, there is a strong framework of safeguards in place to ensure that consumers are not taken advantage of and to ensure that this policy process operates in a fair and reasonable way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this bill that we're debating here today, the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Protecting Consumers from Predatory Leasing Practices) Bill 2020, would only reduce the payment options available to Centrelink customers to pay for household items. In effect, it removes choice, and that is something that we, as Liberals, should always be incredibly cognisant of and, I believe, should always seek to protect. So, on that basis, I urge the Senate not to support the bill. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ANTIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  I rise to speak in relation the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Protecting Consumers from Predatory Leasing Practices) Bill 2020. This is a bill that the government does not support. The purpose of this private member's bill, as described in the explanatory memorandum, is purported to be amending:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to provide that the department secretary may not make any deductions requested by a person from their social security payments if the deductions relate to goods hired under a consumer lease entered into by the person </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, if passed, the bill would impact Centrelink customers who want to use consumer leases and who want to use Centrepay as their preferred payment method. This bill, in my respectful submission, fits comfortably in the remit of the statement: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centrepay is a free and voluntary service that allows people to pay their bills and expenses as regular deductions from their Centrelink payment to approved businesses. People can start, change or cancel their Centrepay deductions at any time. As we heard earlier this morning, it was introduced in 1999, effectively as a bill-paying service to support customers in paying household and utility costs. As the deduction is taken out before the income support payment is made, the program is designed to reduce the default risk for the customers as well the businesses themselves. It's unique in this respect, compared to other financial products such as, for example, direct debit. Since this time, Centrepay has grown and expanded into more than just a means to pay a bill. In fact, in the last five years, 46 per cent of all Centrepay customers have used the service for more than one service reason, suggesting that it's actually being used as a financial management tool. The categories of goods and services that are approved for Centrepay use include, but are not necessarily limited to: accommodation, education and employment, health, utility costs, household goods, travel and transport costs, social and recreational costs, sometimes legal and professional services costs, and, indeed, the costs of financial products. Around 75 per cent of the monies dispersed through Centrepay are actually for accommodation and utilities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Payday lenders, short-term repayments and schemes known as buy-now pay-later schemes are actually excluded from Centrepay and have never had access to the scheme. It's important to note that all consumer lease businesses which are actually accessing Centrepay must have other payment options available, such as cash or credit card. Those using Centrepay are not forced to do so. It's actively used by government and non-government entities, such as state governments for matters that include court fine repayments, and sometimes by not-for-profit organisations offering low- and no-interest loans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are presently 94,000 customers, or 14 per cent of customers, who use Centrepay to manage the purchase of goods using consumer leases. The value of Centrepay deductions for consumer leases actually represents nine per cent of all of the deductions made under this scheme. Entering into any consumer lease and using Centrepay to make payments due under a consumer lease are, as we've said, voluntary. Deductions from the customer's payment can cease at any time, although this doesn't necessarily cease obligations pursuant to the consumer lease itself. Customers must provide informed consent before a deduction arrangement using Centrepay can actually be put in place. To help protect customers and so as not to unduly restrict access to their finance, Centrepay only allows consumer leases which are covered by the regulatory framework under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. It requires consumer lease businesses to be properly licensed and to properly comply with responsible lending obligations as overseen by the regulatory body, ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The history of accessing consumer leases is now 20 years old. Since 2001, consumer leases for household goods have been allowed. On 1 July 2015 the then Department of Human Services introduced a new Centrepay policy and terms which excluded unregulated consumer leases for household goods and funeral insurance. Unregulated leases are those which are exempt from the National Consumer Credit Protection Act and are less than four months or indefinite in duration. By 17 February 2017, all leases that were not regulated were removed from the scheme. Due to the gap in accessibility for some consumers to access microfinance and money for emergencies, regulated consumer leases now remain on Centrepay as a viable option to acquire household goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government takes its responsibility to consumers very, very seriously. While Labor will tell you that this bill helps protect consumers and ensures low-income, vulnerable Australians are not exploited, they seem to have missed the crucial outcome of this bill were it to be passed; that is, the bill would allow for discrimination against people who are currently on Centrelink—individuals who may not otherwise have access to payment terms because of this predicament—or people on lower incomes who may lack a credit rating or have a low credit rating. I'll remind this chamber that, unfortunately, many of those who are recipients of welfare may actually be unable to access some forms of credit, such as credit cards. For many, regulated consumer leasing is one of the very, very few ways to obtain essential household goods in an expedient manner. Often we're talking about very basic, fundamental items like a fridge, a washing machine, a freezer—something of that nature. Any bill that would seek to discriminate and result in the unfair and detrimental treatment of those in our society who are most in need, purely because of their financial predicament, shouldn't be supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor argues in support of the bill by alleging that Centrepay is being used for the benefit of consumer leases or commercial contracts rather than in the interests of Services Australia customers, but this, of course, ignores the careful scrutiny of businesses taking part in the Centrepay program. Services Australia undertakes an assessment of business applications for Centrepay and compliance audits of approved businesses. Approved businesses have to meet and maintain essential criteria, and the assessment process may, in fact, consider items such as whether the business conducts its operations in a manner that is lawful and ethical and does not take advantage of customers. It must take into consideration the past behaviour of the business and the business's representatives. It has to take into account information provided by regulatory bodies, consumers or consumer groups, or law enforcement agencies, and it has to take into account previous dealings with the business and any complaints that have been made against the business. So this process is beyond rigorous. In the 2019-20 financial year, 326 compliance audits were completed, and most identified that noncompliance is actually remedied as part of the review process. If a business is unable to remedy the identified noncompliance concerns, it is either partially or fully suspended from the program, up to the point at which it complies or a decision is made by the agency to withdraw its approval.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst businesses are required to meet the policy and the terms, they're also regulated through the industry's legislation and relevant regulators such as ASIC or the ACCC. These agencies will consider any noncompliance or active investigations with these regulatory bodies and, when notified, they'll review the business's ongoing approval. Where a business breaches Centrepay policy, including other laws and regulations, the agency reviews the business and, as I've said earlier, reconsiders its ongoing approval for Centrepay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy terms and conditions of Centrepay retain the discretion for Services Australia:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">b. the Business (or its Business Representative) has conducted, or may potentially conduct, its operations in a manner that is unethical, inconsistent with the Centrepay objective or takes unfair advantage of Customers</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">e. the Business (or its Business Representative):</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">i. is under investigation by a Regulatory Body or law enforcement agency</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">iii. has had enforcement proceedings brought against it …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are a range of different approaches and matters to be taken into account by Services Australia. The process is clearly extraordinarily rigorous. Services Australia will refer customers to programs such as the NILS, the No Interest Loan Scheme, or to set up other payment options to purchase. Services Australia staff also refer customers to the relevant support services for financial assistance and counselling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind those in this place that entering any consumer lease arrangement is, as we have said and as some of my colleagues have said earlier today, a voluntary matter, and it wouldn't be for government to interfere unduly with one's personal choice. To do so would not be fitting in a society like ours. There can be little doubt that Centrepay has a proven track record of being a valuable bill-paying service that assists many Centrelink recipients with their ongoing expenses and their ongoing financial management, and as a government it's our view that we should aim to have as little interference in people's lives as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Services Australia has provided targeted messages to Centrepay businesses to remind them of their obligations under this scheme. They remind customers to check their Centrepay deductions regularly. Particularly when there may not be a service at the moment to provide links to manage your money, Services Australia provides useful tools and information. In addition to this, Services Australia operates the Financial Information Service, or FIS, which is there to help Australians make informed decisions about their finances. The FIS, the Financial Information Service, helps people to understand a range of implications, including how financial products work and how they affect government payments. It helps them to understand the results of their decisions in the short term and in the longer term; to prepare for their retirement even while they're still working, which, of course, we know is critical; to access other resources; and to access the details of other groups that can assist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, it is my view—it's the government's view—that the Centrepay scheme must maintain its core features, including the voluntary nature of the program, the issue of consumer consent and the strong focus on the need for essential items in a timely manner in low-income households, such as utilities, essential household goods, as I've said earlier, and white goods. For these reasons and more, the government does not support this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I want to discuss this Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Protecting Consumers from Predatory Leasing Practices) Bill 2020 that aims to put a stop to some predatory lenders. It's a topic new to me and I'm not familiar with it, and on the surface it seems a laudable aim to protect people with disability or cognitive impairment, or who are otherwise disadvantaged. I feel disappointed and sad about predators who lend, taking advantage of vulnerable people. It doesn't meet my need for integrity, fairness and compassion. Yet, while One Nation support the intent of this bill, we do not support the solution. Our office called Senator McAllister's office, and apparently there's been no research regarding the number of predatory lenders; the bill is apparently based on an unsighted ASIC report some years ago, lacking data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, as other speakers have pointed out, would stop all arrangements in a way that means some worthy and capable people may miss out altogether on necessary goods such as fridges. This bill would therefore disadvantage the people it is designed to protect unless there's a better solution in place. High-risk borrowers—people on low incomes, disadvantaged—mean high risk to lenders. That means high interest rates. In fact, these lenders may be the only alternative some people have. This bill impinges on a person's right to make those arrangements. There are some lenders in these circumstances who are decent people. There are alternatives to funding, and these need to be understood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, this bill is too blunt an instrument. We believe that the issue that this bill attempts to address needs to be addressed through the Treasury, through consumer law. We're expecting that the responsible lending law that the government has circulated in draft form will address this in a better way for all Australians, not just those on Centrelink payments. So we won't be supporting this bill, and we look forward to the government addressing this through the Treasury, with a proper bill based on consumer protection.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:33</span>):  I rise to speak in the debate on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Protecting Consumers from Predatory Leasing Practices) Bill 2020 that has been put forward by Senator McAllister and her team. The purpose of their bill, as is stated, is to amend the Social Security Act to prevent Centrepay deductions from being made in relation to consumer leases. For those people in the gallery who may not be familiar with consumer leases, they don't relate to property in the real sense. It's not about your house or your apartment. It's about taking out a lease to get yourself a refrigerator or a washing machine—the kinds of appliances that can be really important for people's lives going to plan. They relate to generally smaller sums than the kinds of leases that we associate with real property. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government doesn't support this bill and, I would suggest, with good reason. It brings into sharp focus the approaches of different parties to some really fundamental issues. We have on the one hand some people in our community who can be vulnerable and who, by reason of their being a recipient of Centrelink payments rather than somebody who is in work, can face some real challenges in meeting all of the expenses they might incur or wish to make in their lives. On the other hand, however, we face the important value that is the right of individuals to choose what they do with their money and to do so without governments telling them what they are and aren't entitled to spend their money on. They are entitled to the opportunity to learn from participation and from experience how to, and whether they wish to, interact with all the different types of items for sale and all the different types of products in the financial space that are available to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we think of financial literacy as being one of the real problems, where people find themselves in something of a cycle of hardship, financial literacy is a really big part of both the problem and the way out. One is more likely to end up in circumstances where they need assistance if they have lower financial literacy, but, at the same time, if we take away the right of all individuals to make choices about what they want to do with their money they are denied the opportunity to build their financial literacy by gradual experience. So we need to make sure that the way we handle this area of law takes into account the need to balance the risk that a person might be exploited by an unscrupulous provider against the really important value that a person should be able to choose and should be able to learn by participation. They are both really important things.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has done what I would suggest is a good job of balancing those considerations. Rather than taking away the ability of people to engage in leases or enter into different financial products that might suit their individual needs, despite the fact that they are in receipt of social security assistance, we instead took the step of conducting a detailed review from 2013 to 2015 of the way that these types of products are offered and assisted in their delivery by payment using the Centrepay service. In doing so it was this government, importantly, for the record—not those opposite, who did nothing about it when they were in government, but this government—that knocked off hundreds and hundreds of loan shark like businesses that were indeed unscrupulous in the way they operated in this field. One example that was quite confronting to see was that some of the unscrupulous vendors who have since been pushed out of this system—they have not been able to participate since 2015—would go into Aboriginal communities and sell insurance products, like funeral insurance, to 10-year-old kids. It isn't fair, it isn't sensible and it's not the kind of thing that meets what I would suggest is our sense of right and wrong. The consequence of that review and that process, which I understand was led by both now Minister Payne and now Minister Robert, was that over 1,000 providers that were at that time registered to deliver services that were paid for through Centrepay were kicked out of the system. I think that says something about the rigour that has been applied to this sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth turning our minds to this: what exactly is Centrepay? Those people who haven't had the experience of being in receipt of social security benefits may not have come into contact with it. For those listening from home, Centrepay is a free service. It is offered as part of the suite of tools offered by Services Australia, formerly known as the Department of Human Services, to help people who are in receipt of a welfare benefit to manage their money as they grow their financial literacy. The way it works is it allows a person to set up a whole series of direct debits, if they wish—they can use it as many or as few times as they want to. It means that they can set it up so that bills, utilities, rent and the like come out of their Centrelink payment, and then what remains, once all of those important and core expenses of life are taken care of, is deposited into their bank account for use. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centrepay was created in 1999 and in the last five years it was used, at some point, by 46 per cent of all people who are Centrelink customers. That speaks to something of the need for it and it speaks to its usefulness as people are going through a phase in their lives when they are getting hold of their financial situation and doing what they can to build financial literacy. It means, for those people who use it, that all of the essentials of life are covered before the remainder of the payment is deposited into their account. It's really important for making sure that a person in receipt of social security benefits is able to manage their household budget well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The categories of goods and services that are covered by Centrepay are quite broad. It can cover accommodation, education and employment, health services, utilities, household goods, travel and transport, even some social and recreational type activities, legal and professional services in some circumstances, and a range of financial products. In the financial year just gone, there was an average of 648,000 customers a month who used the service, and they used it to make 26 million Centrepay deductions worth over $2.76 billion to approximately 14,000 approved businesses. So you can see that it is really quite a widely used service that is important in the lives of many Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we're coming up to Christmas, and I think it's worth acknowledging that, for people who are on social security benefits, it can be a time when it's tough to manage your money. Controlling and staying on top of managing your income, particularly when you've got dependants, too, can be really difficult. But Centrepay gives control back to people so that they never miss the fundamentals. They never miss paying rent. They never lose the roof over their heads. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the kind of responsible approach to managing money that this government tries to bring to everything. We want to empower people who are in receipt of government assistance—and of course we hope that that will be short-lived; we hope that people will be able to make the transition back into work as soon as possible, as soon as their life circumstances and the job market permits. But we take the approach that it is important to empower people as individuals to make the best possible choices for their own future, because what the best choice is for you to do with your money, Madam Acting Deputy President, might well be different from what is right for me or, indeed, right for every other Australian. We'll all have different priorities and different values, and different things we want to achieve, and it would really be quite arrogant for any government to think that it knows and it should decide what a person is allowed to do with their money. Instead, this voluntary, free service helps people manage the pressure of their competing priorities so that not only do the fundamentals get paid—the rent gets paid, the lights stay on; all that can happen—but also they're able to make some choices for themselves about what they want to do with the rest of their money. The success of Centrepay is really about the fact that it's voluntary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we strengthen the help that's available to individuals who are receiving government assistance, who are developing their financial literacy, we are also strengthening that help on the other side by making sure that the system is only able to be accessed by those who participate according to clear and defined rules of the game, which means that the suppliers who receive payments through Centrepay have to comply with quite rigorous standards of auditing. They have to sign up to a code about how they interact with and treat the people from whom they are receiving payments through Centrepay. Importantly, they have to work with them to hear on a regular basis how they can continually deliver better outcomes for customers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is really a program of consumer consent with a focus on the basics. It's entirely consistent with that that a person who finds themselves in a situation where one of the basics they need to operate is on the blink—whether that's a washing machine that they must have as a matter of urgency to get the kids' school uniforms clean and for them to get on with their education, for instance—is able to make decisions for themselves about what works best. Some people will be able to just go down to Harvey Norman and pick up a new machine, but that's not the case for everyone. For someone who can't access microfinance, for instance—that's part of one of the really low- or no-interest programs that already exist—the existence of consumer leases can be a really important resource. And, provided it's done within the bounds of ethics, as this government has sought to make sure is the case by all of the different types of regulated leases that are available, it gets the balance right between giving people choice and making sure they're not exploited. Who are we as a parliament to tell the mother who needs to get uniforms washed for their kids for school so that they can participate in their education for the coming week that, no, they can't go down and get themselves a washing machine on a plan? This isn't a buy-now pay-later arrangement; this is the rental of an item, but it can be just what's needed to fill a hole in a person's laundry, shall we say, but also to help them get through a hole in their budget for the short term. And that is only right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When a company who is a participant in the Centrepay scheme is found to do the wrong thing, of course this government steps in and boots them off it until they fix whatever it is that's causing problems. The regulatory framework means these types of businesses have to be licensed; they have to comply with responsible lending obligations; they are overseen by a regulator; and this isn't a service that's offered to cash lenders, pawnbrokers or buy-now pay-later schemes. This is really an important part of the services that are available to people who are in receipt of government assistance, and using Centrepay to help them get on top of their expenses is not only a sensible thing but it is the right thing to do, as we—to bring it back to where I began—balance their need to be protected from vulnerability with their need to develop the skills they need for financial literacy through participation and experience in the market as the capable individuals they are.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  In summary, these bills are a massive opportunity for free enterprise to fix an unprecedented by-product of human progress. I urge the CSIRO to work with industry to produce biodegradable and compostable plastics that allow Australians to simply switch from environmentally damaging materials to environmentally friendly materials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and associated bills are a win for the environment, a win for Australia and a win for the countries we have been dumping our rubbish into. The extent of this win depends on the response from the CSIRO and from industry. I'd like to take this opportunity to address the fact that the environment can be an opportunity—a huge opportunity—for high productivity and for a competitive advantage. Let's consider the evolution, for example, of management attitudes in business and society's attitudes to safety, quality and the environment. One has followed the other. Safety, initially, was seen as a cost, a burden. But, incidents, whether they injure people or are just simply near misses, are waste. Removing that waste, removing incidents and near misses, improves productivity and profit. This has driven me in my career in management. Improving safety reduces costs, improves productivity and improves profit. That's now accepted, although still not widely followed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, there's quality. Quality was seen, initially, as a cost. High quality came with extra cost. Yet the Japanese miracle in manufacturing in the seventies and eighties turned that around, because the Japanese understood that defects are waste. Removing those defects improved quality, reduced costs, improved productivity and improved profit. This has driven my work in improving processes at work—in workplaces and in leadership processes. Quality is now understood to lead to lower costs, and that is why the lowest-cost producers in the world in manufactured goods have the highest quality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The same cannot yet be said for the environment. Environmental issues, sadly, are still seen quite often as a cost. Yet looking after the environment removes waste and improves productivity and profit. Real environmental problems, such as real pollution of air, water and soil, add to cost. Take the example of the removal of car exhaust pollution. Car exhaust pollution in California is now one-thousandth what it was in the seventies. That has led to increased efficiency in the use of fuel, lower pollution, lower costs for motorists, lower costs for producers and lower costs for the cities of California.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet today there are still too many fabricated environmental problems, nonproblems cloaked as environmental issues. Making up environmental problems is physically and morally reprehensible. It hurts people. It adds needless cost, which the poor pay disproportionately. For example, labelling carbon dioxide as a pollutant is dishonest and contradicts science and nature. Car pollution consists of nitrous oxides, sulphur oxides and particulates. These were cleaned up in California and cleaned up in our country. Now we have carbon dioxide fabricated as a pollutant, and that is dishonest and contradicts science and nature. Carbon dioxide is nature's trace atmospheric gas, essential to all life on this planet. It cannot be a pollutant. We cannot affect the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; the empirical evidence shows that. It is not a pollutant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to do its work on hydrocarbon fuels and to understand natural climate variability and how it has been fabricated dishonestly by the Greens and others into climate change due to human activity, when that is false. This distracts from real and serious environmental problems. So, while I compliment the government for its work on plastics and removing plastics from the pollution stream, we need to buck up when it comes to carbon dioxide. Claiming that carbon dioxide is a pollutant leads to needlessly higher electricity prices. The noted and reputable economist Alan Moran calculates, using the government's own data, that it adds $13 billion a year to the cost of electricity in additional costs, that it adds $1,300 to the cost of electricity to the typical household and that 2.3 jobs are lost for every so-called green job that is created by these subsidies. This is hurting the poor. As a result of this climate change nonsense, we have the theft of property rights from farmers. That increases food costs, which hurts the poor. This climate scam is hurting the poor; it is antihuman; it increases costs needlessly, and disproportionately for the poor and those who cannot afford it; it increases waste right through our society; it decreases productivity; and it decreases wealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When ideology is wrapped as an environmental issue, as it is with the climate scam, then everyone suffers, particularly when the real aim of this climate scam is simply to control people. Everyone hurts. We need to get back to real and serious environmental issues. This climate scam is distracting us, our money, our time, our attention, our interest, our energy and our effort from real and serious environmental issues.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:04</span>):  I rise to speak on the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and associated bills, which were introduced to the House of Representatives on 27 August this year. The aim of this bill is to regulate the export of waste materials in line with the commitment of the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, earlier this year to ban the export of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres. Only those products that have been processed into a value added material and will be reused or remanufactured overseas will be permitted for export. This legislation will also manage the environmental, health and safety impacts of products, particularly the impacts associated with the disposal of waste products, and provide for voluntary co-regulatory and mandatory product stewardship schemes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Planet Ark research shows that 51 per cent of Australia's household waste is recycled, which is on par with recycling rates in many northern European countries. Even better, Australia has been a world leader in newspaper recycling for years, but we have a way to go with electronic waste recycling. E-waste is increasing at three times the rate of other waste in Australia. Voluntary industry programs, like Cartridges 4 Planet Ark and MobileMuster, have been providing recycling options for many years now, but we've been slow to provide recycling services for televisions, computers and batteries. These bills mean we will be slow no more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">COAG's commitment to banning the export of certain waste materials was target 1 of the National Waste Policy Action Plan 2019. This plan was developed to drive change within industry, businesses, governments and the community to turn waste into a reusable commodity. The strategy to phase out the export of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres was released in March this year and sets out both the challenges and opportunities presented by the ban and the longer term changes ahead for Australia's waste and recycling sector. The ban on the export of waste products starts with waste glass from 1 January 2021, followed by mixed plastics from 1 July 2021, whole used tyres from 1 December 2021, single resin or polymer plastics from 1 July 2022 and mixed or unsorted paper and cardboard from 1 July 2024.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills encourage a circular economy for Australia's waste through the enhancement of voluntary product stewardship. Such an economy will support businesses to realise the full value of recyclable materials as a sustainable resource, with full consideration of the product's entire life cycle. The bills replace the framework contained within the Product Stewardship Act 2011. This act will be repealed by the Recycling and Waste Reduction (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2020.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year I visited the Dulverton Waste Management facility at Latrobe in Tasmania's north-west. This facility is already following the recycling and reuse ideals we are aiming for in this legislation. Dulverton provides sustainable landfill and organics recycling services for more than 80 commercial, industrial and government clients across Tasmania. It was constructed in 1995 at a former clay quarry site under the joint authority of four north-west councils—the Central Coast, Devonport City, Kentish and Latrobe councils.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 40 per cent of the waste volume at the Dulverton Waste Management facility is organic. It is recycled into nutrient-rich compost used by Tasmanian nurseries, landscapers, public land managers, vineyards, flower and berry growers, orchards and dairy farmers. This recycled compost product stimulates plant growth, increases soil microbial life, unlocks soil nutrients for plants, improves soil salinity and sodicity—the amount of salt held in soil—and increases the soil's water-holding capacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dulverton also collaborates with waste management groups throughout the state and works with businesses and industry bodies to raise awareness of waste avoidance and recycling best practices. The Australian government has made targeted investments to build a stronger Australian recycling industry and create more jobs as a result of these waste management reforms. A number of complementary measures have been introduced to support the objectives of these bills, including $190 million for a new Recycling Modernisation Fund. This fund will leverage $600 million of recycling infrastructure reinvestment, creating more than 10,000 jobs and diverting more than 10 million tonnes of waste from landfill to make useful products when combined with activity from the National Waste Policy Action Plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite comments made by those on the other side in earlier contributions, I'm very pleased to advise the Senate that an $11 million joint recycling agreement between the Australian and Tasmanian governments was announced in Launceston recently. This landmark agreement, signed by federal Minister for the Environment, Sussan Ley, and Tasmania's Minister for Environment and Parks, Roger Jaensch, will deliver a $16 million boost for the state's recycling industry, creating jobs and reducing pressure on the environment. This partnership is part of the Australian government's $190 million Recycling Modernisation Fund and will leverage a further $5.5 million from Tasmanian industry via matched investment from businesses who will turn the high-quality recycled material into new products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other complementary measures supporting the bill's objectives include: $20 million for the National Product Stewardship Investment Fund to grow new and existing schemes, which will contribute to meeting our national target of recovering 80 per cent of our waste resources by 2030; $35 million to implement Commonwealth commitments under Australia's National Waste Policy Action Plan, which sets the direction for waste management policy and recycling in Australia until 2030; $24.6 million for Commonwealth commitments to improve our national waste data so it can measure recycling outcomes and track progress against our national waste targets; $20 million through a special round of the cooperative research centre's projects to find new and innovative solutions to plastic recycling and waste, including new ways of incorporating recycled plastics in manufacturing and construction; strengthening the Commonwealth procurement guidelines to enable any procurement undertaken by a Commonwealth agency to consider environmental sustainability and the use of recycled content when determining value for money, because by using our purchasing power we can generate demand and encourage innovation; and also working with the states and territories to develop national standards and specifications for the use of recycled content in a broad range of capital works projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to stop exporting untreated and unprocessed waste that is likely to have a negative impact on the environment or harm human health in the country that receives this waste. Our waste management and recycling sector will collect, recover, recycle and reuse waste and convert it into new products as a result. Through better product design, manufacture, distribution and use, we will all take greater responsibility for environmental impacts. Australia is not only taking responsibility for its waste but also ensuring this waste is managed effectively and transformed into a resource we can use again and again. We've turned the tables on the thought that waste is just an environmental product problem that needs to be solved, instead seeing it as an opportunity to design, manufacture and create new products and foster new industries. Reforming our practices around unprocessed waste products will lead to a fundamental change in attitude that will positively affect our bottom line. Waste management and recycling practices that stem from this bill are expected to add $3.6 billion to the Australian economy's turnover and generate $1.5 billion in economic activity over the next 20 years. In addition to ensuring we are recycling and reusing our waste products, the bill will set out obligations for manufacturers, importers and distributors in relation to those products. This legislation also sets out accreditation arrangements for voluntary product stewardship, which will help Australian consumers understand the impact of certain products so they can make better choices when purchasing and disposing of products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recycling and reusing products is something Australians care deeply about. To understand this, we only need to look at the uptake of local government kerbside recycling programs, the popularity of bottle-recycling schemes and the number of people who spend their weekends combing through tip shops and travelling between garage sales to find products they can upcycle for their homes or resell at market stalls and in shops. People spend time sorting and separating their recyclable paper, glass and plastic packaging to put into the recycling bins or taking products to their local waste collection facilities, and they want to know these products are going to be repurposed effectively, not dumped in an ever-growing landfill facility or sent overseas. The export bans outlined in the bill are our way of ensuring these products will be reused productively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recycling benefits our planet, our economy and ourselves. Reusing products decreases the amount of raw materials needed, and the manufacture of new products from recycled materials uses less energy. Recycling creates more jobs than landfill does, and new industries created through reuse boost the economy. We are taking responsibility for our waste by regulating the way products are used, from initial design and manufacture through to reuse or recycling into a different product. This commitment will expand the capacity of our industries, as well as open opportunities for new product ideas, new technologies and new markets for these products. It will ensure our resources will be used in sustainable ways for future generations. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:14</span>):  It is a pleasure to speak on one of the most important issues currently facing our nation: protecting our environment for today, for tomorrow and into the future for generation after generation. A key part of this commitment is to stop the waste. That is key to our protection of the environment on the land, in the air, along our coastlines and in our precious oceans. The Morrison government is committed to bringing to an end the 645,000 tonnes of unprocessed plastic, paper, glass and tyres which Australia ships annually overseas. The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and related bills will provide a vital phased approach to ensure that this becomes a reality. As the Prime Minister said so succinctly: it is our waste; it is our responsibility.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm incredibly proud of the many ways in which the Morrison government is committed to protecting our environment. Whether it's meeting and beating our climate targets or supporting local environmental community initiatives, this is a government which takes the practical environmental actions which are required. By way of example, the government released the <span style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly update of Australia's national greenhouse gas inventory: June 2020</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>a very short time ago. The quarterly update confirms that Australia has beaten its 2020 target for lower emissions—the target period being 2013-20—by 459 million tonnes, an overachievement on the previous record, being that between 2008 and 2012. This is an increase on the previous estimate of 411 million tonnes published in December 2019. Australia's overachievement on its 2020 target is due in large part to significant structural declines in emissions from the electricity and agriculture sectors. In 2019-20, emissions in the National Electricity Market, which is Australia's largest electricity grid, fell 5.3 per cent to a new record low. Of course, this has also been driven very substantially by Australia's incredible investment in renewable energy—some $30 billion since 2017—as we continue to deploy new solar and wind at a rate that is 10 times faster than the global average. Recent advice from the Clean Energy Regulator is that this trend is expected to continue in the coming years. This is evidence of real action by a government with practical, real solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, in contrast, remains committed to its reckless targets. We have seen in recent weeks the war within the Labor Party over climate and energy policy. Labor is all at sea. Independent modelling by BAEconomics shows Labor's 45 per cent emissions reduction target and its 50 per cent renewable energy target would drive up wholesale power prices by 58 per cent, cost the economy $472 billion, reduce real wages by $9,000 per household and slash 336,000 jobs. At least there are some in Labor who have worked this out and worked out the cost of the reckless policies which Labor, of course, took to the last election and which were soundly defeated. Yet it is very concerning that much of Labor's true thinking was revealed by its Labor Environment Action Network, which said: 'High prices are not a market failure. They are proof of the market working well.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the Morrison government's approach with these bills before us today harnesses a cooperative approach with business and other levels of government, along with the community and individuals. Minister Sussan Ley said in her second reading speech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill implements the agreement by all of Australia's governments to ban the export of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres. It also incorporates the framework of the existing Product Stewardship Act 2011. It includes improvements to better regulate and encourage our businesses—those that design, manufacture, distribute and use products—to take greater responsibility for their environmental impacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's a key point: governments can do so much, but in order for us to reduce our waste, in order for us to embrace the circular economy, we have to work together with every single business which creates waste and with every single family in every household across Australia. These bills is a very important part of our very significant efforts to transform the nation's waste and recycling sector. It says that we have to take responsibility for what we produce and that the more we can recycle the less goes into landfill and the better we are now and into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth's 2018 National Waste Policy identifies five overarching circular economy waste principles. The first is to avoid waste, and that is by prioritising waste avoidance; encouraging efficient use, re-use and repair; and designing products to minimise waste so that they are made to last and so that we can more easily recover materials from products which are produced. A second important principle is to improve resource recovery—that is, to improve material collection systems and processes for recycling and improve the quality of recycled material we produce. The third principle is to increase the use of recycled material and build demand and markets for recycled products—one person's rubbish is another person's treasure! That ability for us to see much of what we produce as being recycled throughout our economy is a very important principle. The fourth principle is the better management of material flows to benefit human health, the environment and the economy. And the fifth principle is to improve information to support innovation, guide investment and enable informed consumer decisions. All of these principles make good environmental sense, and they are key to tackling the problem before us today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government, led by Prime Minister Morrison, is to be congratulated for its unwavering commitment to pursuing better environmental outcomes for all Australians. The export ban will be phased in, starting with glass on 1 January 2021; then including mixed plastics, whole used tyres and single-resin, or polymer, plastics; and culminating in July 2024 when mixed and unsorted paper and cardboard will be included. The export ban would only apply to unprocessed waste, which allows for the processing of waste materials within Australia for subsequent export and use in overseas manufacturing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Ley has made it very clear that this offers an economic opportunity for Australia, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The waste export ban is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform our waste management and recycling sector to collect, recycle, reuse and convert waste into a resource—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">a resource we can continue to use as a nation over and over. These reforms are expected to see the Australian economy turn over an additional $3.6 billion and potentially generate $1.5 billion in additional economic activity over the next 20 years. So this is a big win for both the environment and our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that, if action is not taken, scientists estimate that in 30 years time the weight of plastics in our oceans will exceed the weight of the fish in the oceans, and that's a pretty horrifying thought. I know where I live, in south-west Victoria, including in the wonderful electorate of Corangamite, that is a very important priority. We want to make sure that our oceans are as clean as they possibly can be, and in communities where I live throughout the Corangamite electorate—a magnificent part of the world, as we know—there is a really strong and important focus on reducing plastic in our oceans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians create around 67 million tonnes of waste each year. We want to see less waste going to landfill and ending up in oceans and more being reused and recycled. We are building Australia's domestic recycling capability through our $167 million Australian recycling investment plan. This plan will increase Australia's recycling rates, tackle plastic waste and litter, accelerate work on a new battery recycling scheme and halve food waste by 2030. I'm also very pleased that microbeads are being rapidly phased out: 94 per cent of cosmetic and personal care products in Australia are already microbead free. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">National environmental initiatives are vital, but so are local environmental initiatives, and I was very pleased recently to join with the Corangamite Catchment Management Authority to announce some very important local environmental programs for south-west Victoria, including the $6 million Wild Otways Initiative, which includes a $1 million community environmental grants program, and that's been, of course, steered through Minister Ley's office. This is a wonderful opportunity for local environment groups to make an application for funding to support a local environmental project, whether it be programs to improve weed and pest animal control, fencing and access track construction or other improvement works, and wildlife habitat improvement works. So, for those who are reading this <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> or listening to this debate and are interested in protecting our environment, I would absolutely commend this local project, which is a result of the Morrison government's commitment to our local environment. Of course, that was a commitment made before the last federal election. It was not matched by Labor, I note, which was pretty disappointing. These grants will provide an amount of funding between $5,000 and $50,000 each year for up to two years. So they are very substantial local grants and are a really good example of how local initiatives do matter. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This recycling and waste reduction bill represents an effective and cooperative government, business and community approach to protecting our environment. I'm very pleased that the private sector has shown a willingness to be part of the solution at Australia's first National Plastics Summit, hosted by this government in March. We saw a number of very major pledges from leading companies, including the Pact Group, Nestle, McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Coles, all of which, of course, produce an enormous amount of waste. It is obviously important—very important—that we see that sort of commitment from our large businesses and companies around Australia. So, to every business, large and small: please have a look at what we are doing to support waste reduction, recycling and the circular economy. We are absolutely determined, as a government, to protect Australia's precious environment, to reduce waste and to embrace our circular economy. Our commitment in this bill is another example of our commitment to the environment, and I commend this bill and related bills to the Senate. </span>

I want to particularly acknowledge the work that my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson has done through his extensive advocacy on this issue, his work in multiple inquiries on waste and the detailed amendments that he has circulated and been negotiating on across the parliament with regard to these bills. Senator Whish-Wilson has been on the case of waste management and the need for better waste management the whole time he has been in the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we said in our additional comments to the committee report, the Greens feel these bills are a step in the right direction. But it will be a missed opportunity if this legislation is passed in its current form without substantive amendments. We recognise that there are some very positive elements in these bills, but there is much more that needs to be done. In particular the idea of an export ban is great, and it has been really good to be here this morning to hear government senators talk about their commitment to recycling, to waste management and to no longer shipping all of our waste offshore. It's a good start. But where we think we particularly need to have more action is in the various targets that are set in these bills; they need to be mandatory. It is not going to be good enough just to have voluntary targets.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recycling and waste management is an absolutely serious issue, particularly with regard to plastic waste. As Senator Whish-Wilson has already outlined in his contribution, 40 per cent of the plastic used here is single use. It has an average life span of 12 minutes. That's absolutely shocking. Only 16 per cent of that plastic is being recycled; that means 84 per cent is going elsewhere, as waste in the oceans, in our bushlands, in our streets or in landfills. Wherever it is, it's not being reused. It's a waste, and it's having an impact on the environment. We know that 80 per cent of marine debris is plastic and that global consumption of plastic could triple by 2040. There is a horrific amount of plastic in our oceans already, and, tragically, more is on its way unless we act. This matters for all of us; it matters for us, for the fish that we eat, for the oceans that we swim in and for the beaches that we walk on. Without urgent, drastic action, the situation is only going to get worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recycling is something that really matters to people. It's something that people engage with every day. People want to do the right thing. People want to feel that they are contributing to creating a cleaner and a better environment that we all share. They know that they should do the right thing. Essentially, the role of government is to make things easier for them. So we need legislation that has the government doing its bit and businesses doing their bit so that it makes it easier for everybody. That means you need to have mandatory measures in place so that all businesses then know where they stand. You can't have some businesses playing the situation off against each other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot understand the reluctance to implement mandatory targets when we basically have the industry saying: 'Look, it's not going to cost us any more. We've got some quite ambitious targets. We think we're going to meet them.' Why not make them mandatory? Why not put in legislation that this is where we are absolutely committed to heading? We have mandatory targets and mandatory standards across all other parts of our lives. Whether it's in health and safety, whether it's in sporting competitions, whether it's in industrial relations or whether it's in human rights, we have standards that are absolute commitments that we have to meet. I cannot see why those standards should be voluntary rather than mandatory in the critical area of protecting our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Plus, having mandatory standards gives certainty to business. It makes it clear that those are the standards that they are going to reach, and it gives business the confidence to invest the hundreds of millions of dollars that are going to be needed in the circular economy.  It's the same situation we are in with the lack of certainty about investing in renewable energy, with all of the toing and froing and with businesses not knowing where they stand. They are saying that that is the reason there hasn't been as much investment as there otherwise would have been. The same will go here: it's not going to be good enough just to have the export ban; you need to give businesses certainty to invest in the industries that are going to be part of the circular economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People are aware of how damaging plastic waste is, and we know that lots of people have taken action to try and remove plastic from their lives altogether. They want to see government working with them to make it easier for them. Like so many other people, I try and reduce the amount of plastic that comes into my household. I bring my own cloth bags, reuse plastic bags, wash plastic bags and resist buying takeaway food if it comes in single-use plastic containers, and I know there are millions of Australians like me who are just as passionate. Of course, I recycle everything I can, including plastic packaging and soft plastics. But at the moment it's hard work, because we don't have an industry set up to be using that plastic. We don't have the recycling industries. We know currently with the drop in the amount we've been able to export, with countries saying, 'No, we don't want your plastic waste anymore,' the market for recycled plastics has collapsed. Local governments have stopped collecting the amount of plastics that they used to, because there's just not anywhere for them to go. I now bring my mother's plastic containers, which she gets with her Meals on Wheels, home from her place because her local government is no longer recycling them. Basically, you've got to be committed to doing that and committed to the recycling of soft plastics, which you've got to take off yourself and take to the supermarket. We need to be making it easier for people. We need the government to be working with the community and working with industry, and that means having the mandatory targets. It means doing more than what is set out in this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Making best use of our resources and reusing and recycling is not just about plastics. There has been a lot of focus on plastics. Urgent action is needed in another area: we need more action to encourage the recycling and the reuse of paper products. That will have a direct impact on protecting our forests. Five years ago, in 2015, I moved a motion calling on the government to ensure that government agencies were using 100 per cent recycled paper. Of course, the response was some waffle about one agency, of the many across the entire Commonwealth, that was using 100 per cent recycled paper. They didn't address the real issue, which was using the procurement power of the Commonwealth to support paper recycling. It's tragic, because if we had used that power of procurement and, again, if we had mandatory targets that said, 'This is the level of recycling we are going to have,' it would have directly impacted on the amount of wood pulp for paper that we needed to get out of our native forests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are continuing to devastate our native forests, primarily for woodchips for pulp, whether it's for here in Australia or for export overseas, when we have paper in waste streams going to waste. We've got a situation where we are still continuing to log our mountain ash forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria, home to the critically endangered Leadbeater's possum, to feed the pulp and paper mill at Maryvale, the Nippon mill in the Latrobe Valley, and yet they've got a recycled paper line there that is underused. If we had procurement from this Commonwealth government saying, '100 per cent of the paper being used in Commonwealth agencies needs to be recycled,' that would enable that production to lift and it would enable us to be getting less of the pulp from our native forests. These things have consequences. These things are connected, and there are actions that people want to see being taken that government is in a position to actually implement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Think of the situation that our forests are currently in. Last summer—we're heading into another summer—the devastating bushfires wreaked havoc on our native forests. The impact on our forests from fire was the biggest ever to any continent in the world. Places that have never burnt before were aflame because of the hotter temperatures drying them out. Lives were lost. Homes burnt to the ground. Our firefighters were working days on end, protecting lives around the country. Our forests are under incredible threat from the climate crisis. But still, after last summer, the Liberal Party and National Party are in denial. It wasn't the time to talk about our climate crisis; it was too soon, they said. Well, it's a year later, we're heading into another summer, and we're still waiting for a meaningful acknowledgement from them of the climate crisis. We are still waiting for meaningful action on climate, and this is connected with what we're talking about today, because there is a suite of actions that need to take place in order to protect our environment. You can't get up and give fine-sounding words about your commitment to recycling without seeing that these issues are all interconnected. Yes, you need to be taking action on recycling, but it's not enough just to have fine-sounding words and voluntary targets. You need to be addressing the pressures on our environment across the board, and that means taking action on our climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to forests, instead of taking action on our climate crisis, instead of saying we're going to have mandatory targets for paper recycling, they're extending the regional forest agreements, extending the devastation of our native forests by years, when they should be shifting all of our forestry into plantations and getting out of native forest logging as quickly as possible to protect our precious wildlife, protect our water supplies and do something about protecting the carbon stores that our forests are. We should be protecting our forests because of, just intrinsically, how beautiful and precious they are in their own right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our handling of waste and recycling matters—it matters today for all Australians. We can have the Prime Minister rocking up to the UN and saying that he wants Australia to lead the world in recycling, but we know the truth, and the truth is that Australians are actually tired of being taken for mugs by this Prime Minister. People used to criticise Mr Shorten for having different answers for when he was talking to people in Brunswick from when he was talking to people Townsville. But the truth is that when you base your approach, particularly to the environment, on marketing spin, you're going to be caught in the same trap. The Prime Minister was very happy to make a big, flashy speech at the UN talking about how much he cares about the environment and wants to lead on recycling and waste handling, but it's time he stopped taking Australians for fools. We can see the truth behind the smirk. You cannot be serious about the environment unless you are being serious about the climate crisis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the same Prime Minister who brought his lump of coal into the parliament and sat on the front bench fondling it, like Gollum holding his precious. The truth is that, despite all of Prime Minister Morrison's marketing spin, if you care about the environment, you must act on the climate emergency. The Prime Minister is happy to wear a hard hat and talk about mining coal when in Queensland, but, when he goes to the UN, he won't admit to being one of the world's worst polluters or holding back action on emissions. Instead, he pretends to be doing something by talking about recycling. Well, Australian voters see past it. They see past the spin to the fossil fuel lobby that is propping up the Liberal Party. In conclusion, these bills are a small positive step in the right direction, but so much more needs to be done. More than that, we need, in addition to action on recycling, action on our environment crisis and urgent action on our climate crisis—not tomorrow but today or, even better, yesterday.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RENNICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  I rise today in support of the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and cognate bills. I commend the government's commitment to stop shipping our unprocessed recyclable waste overseas. In the last reported financial year, Australia shipped over 4.44 megatonnes of waste overseas, with 15 per cent of this being unprocessed plastics, glass, paper and cardboard—that is, over 600,000 tonnes. Given the nature of the recent bans on recyclable waste, in particular by some of the largest waste importers including China, Malaysia, Indonesia, India and the Philippines, the issue of exporting waste is no longer a viable management strategy. Waste is a threat to our environment and none more so than waste from our renewable energy industry. I must admit that I did agree with Senator Rice's contribution to this debate, when she said that it should be mandatory for some companies to clean up their waste, none more so than waste from our renewable energy industry. Renewable energy companies, industries and advocates are notorious for hiding and minimising their environmental and human health impacts. They demand and receive exemptions from health and endangered species laws that apply to other industries. They make promises they cannot keep about being able to safely replace fossil fuels that now provide over 80 per cent of the world's global energy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A few articles have noted some of the serious environmental, toxic, radioactive waste, human health and child labour issues inherent in mining rare earth and cobalt lithium deposits. However, we need quantitative studies—detailed rigorous, honest, transparent, cradle-to-the-grave, peer-reviewed analysis. It's been calculated that replacing 160,000 terawatts of global energy consumption with wind would require 183 million turbines needing roughly: 461 billion tonnes of steel for towers; 460 billion tonnes of steel and concrete for the foundations; 59 million tonnes of copper, steel and alloy for the turbines; 738 million tonnes of neodymium for turbine magnets; 14.7 billion tonnes of steel and complex composite materials for nacelles; and 11 billion tonnes of complex petroleum based composites for rotors and massive quantities of other raw materials. All of this must be mined, processed and manufactured into finished products and shipped around the world. Once the life of these products has ended, they then need to be either disposed of cleanly or recycled. Shipping just the iron ore to build the turbines would require nearly three million voyages in huge ships that would consume 13 billion tonnes of bunker fuel—heavy fuel, at that. Converting that ore to iron and steel would require 473 billion tonnes of coking coal, demanding another 1.2 million sea voyages consuming another six billion tonnes of bunker fuel. For sustainability disciples, does the earth have enough of these raw materials for this transformation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It gets worse. These numbers do not include the ultra-long transmission lines required to carry electricity from windy locations to distant cities. As I mentioned last week, the cause of the 2009 bushfires was determined to be a fallen transmission line. If we're going to build more transmission lines, are we going to put them underground to reduce the risk of fire breaking out?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> Wind turbines and solar panels last just 20 years or less, while coal, gas and nuclear power plants last up to 50 years and require far less land and raw materials. That means we would have to tear down, haul away and replace far more renewable generators twice as often, dispose of or recycle their composite parts and mine, process and ship more ores. Then there are the bird and bat species deaths, the wildlife losses from destroying habitats and the human health impacts from wind turbine noise and flicker. These also need to be examined, fully and honestly, along with the effects of skyrocketing renewable energy prices on every aspect of this transition and of our lives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Solar panels are far more efficient at turning sunlight into heat than they are at turning sunlight into electricity. Solar panels produce more waste heat per watt than any other power source. In areas where there are large solar plants, temperatures can be as much as four degrees hotter than the surrounding land, forming heat islands. Pilots flying lower than 12,000 feet have been reported as feeling the rising hot air. Plants and animals are the enemy of solar and must be removed from solar plants. Since solar plants require vast amounts of land, usually only available in environmentally sensitive areas, wildlife is devastated. It's also worth pointing out that the CSIRO themselves have predicted that Australia's lithium battery waste could exceed over 100,000 tonnes in less than 20 years. Old lithium batteries are a fire risk and they are full of toxic heavy metals that have a limited life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should point out that the Leader of the Opposition, Anthony Albanese, has been accusing this government of playing accounting tricks with the Paris Agreement. If there were ever an accounting trick, it's the fact that the cost of building all these renewables in other countries and the CO2 that's emitted in the production of these renewables aren't included in Australia's targets—and nor, might I add, is recycling or cleaning up these renewables. So, if you want to get serious about where the real accounting trick is, it's that all countries are either in Paris or they're not. What's happening is that a lot of these renewables are being manufactured in non-Paris-committed countries, and those carbon dioxide emissions aren't being included in the countries where that energy's being consumed. So I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition reflect on his comments about accounting tricks, because, if there are any, they arise from the way the Paris Agreement was structured to encourage renewables to be manufactured in countries that do not come under the agreement. Perhaps he might look at other countries rather than try to destroy our productive industries and destroy Australian jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the existing recycling and collection methods and infrastructure, coupled with the recent international agreements relating to hazardous waste movement and plastic marine debris, as well as the development of foreign policy, current data suggests the export of recycled material would no longer be a cost-effective solution and would damage the economy and the environment in the near future. At the forefront of the heavy reliance on international agreements and policy is the 2018 introduction of restrictions on waste imports in China. In the 2017-18 financial year, China was the largest importer of Australian recyclable waste, importing over 1.3 million tonnes of waste. China's new restrictions have caused large-scale changes to the market, including reducing the price of scrap paper, which was once valued at $124 a tonne, by almost 100 per cent. The price of scrap plastic, once valued at $325 per tonne, has reduced by 78 per cent. The price of cardboard, once valued at $210 per tonne, has reduced by 40 per cent. With many other South-East Asian countries reaching capacity and considering new restrictions on recyclable material, it is vital that the government moves away from the export of waste and towards domestic recyclable waste management, as is proposed by this legislation. The export of recyclable waste is no longer a good investment. If nothing is done, it is likely that we will see the export of such waste being valued at less than worthless, leaving Australia with a waste problem that has no prior established solution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this is not just an economic issue. I have no doubt that everyone in this chamber has seen footage of the plastic filled stomachs found in some of our marine birds, and countless images of marine species becoming trapped and strangled by plastic pollution. I guarantee everyone has seen footage of a turtle hopelessly stuck after consuming plastic pollution in the ocean. This is a moral issue and, more importantly, a strong environmental issue. Contrary to the belief of those opposite, I am actually an environmentalist. You will struggle to find someone with more love for our natural environment than me, which is why I spent seven years overseas in my early 20s, travelling around various countries, climbing the slopes of Kilimanjaro or Mont Blanc, diving in numerous countries, hiking in numerous countries, and being fascinated by what a wonderful and beautiful world we live in. One of the things I noticed is that, the poorer the country, the worse the waste problem was. That is why we should never destroy our economy to save the environment, because without a strong economy you will not save the environment. It's very important. Many countries just don't have freely available the things that we take for granted in Australia, like garbage bins, and, for that matter, sanitary facilities. I've been in many places in Third World countries where you get a bit of diarrhoea or something and you have to find a toilet. I can tell you it's something that you take for granted in this country, but in many other countries it is difficult to find. So we should always be ensuring that we protect our economy and keep waste to a minimum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that the reliable, affordable, emission-free energy that is contained within hydro power, hydrogen power and, of course, one of the world's most cleanest and most reliable sources of power, nuclear energy, is the path to the future. It's why I asked in estimates about chirped pulse amplification, which is a technology that has recently come to the fore. In 2018 a Nobel prize was given for work in this area. The technology involves a very strong, powerful laser beam being shone on a nucleus, the idea being that you shine it on the neutrons and try to flip one of the quarks to turn a neutron into a proton. That will reduce the lifespan of radioactive waste from nuclear energy by thousands of years, to about 30 years. If we could do that, that would be a huge step forward in being able to use nuclear energy as a clean, green method of energy, and eventually we're going to have to go there. One of these days, if we ever have to leave Planet Earth, we won't be leaving it with a wind-powered spaceship, I can assure you. There is no wind and not much light up there in space, so, if we ever have to find means to find other resources somewhere else, it's going to have to involve nuclear technology. The country that gets on top of that is going to be the country that leads on manufacturing and things like that, because nuclear energy, if used properly, will be the cheapest form of energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Waste management is crucial to keep Australia's environmental wonders wondrous. That is why, on behalf of the Australian government, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency announced that it is placing over $15 million of funding into 16 projects to help address the solar PV panel efficiency and end-of-life issues. I have always been a strong supporter of adequate strategies and research being used to investigate solar and battery waste, as can be seen by my submission on the EPBC Act. Given the potential environmental disaster solar waste disposal could cause through the leaching of hazardous materials such as lithium and lead, this research funding could not come too soon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to what many have been made to believe by those opposite, the disposal of waste from materials such as solar panels and plastics poses one of the largest environmental threats to countless ecosystems around the world, our beloved Great Barrier Reef being the biggest one close to home. Forget theories based on fundamentally flawed BOM data and methods. Forget the potential negligible impact our farmers have on three per cent of inland reefs. Waste disposal is an environmental disaster that is affecting our marine ecosystems now and is only going to get worse, as solar and battery waste is expected to become a major contributor to national waste in the decades to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By banning unprocessed plastics, cardboard, paper and other recyclable material from being exported, we are creating a circular economy. The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 is simply the first of many reforms to our economy to make it better suited to the changing climate of foreign politics and to ensure the sustainable use of resources for our future generations. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  I rise to speak on the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and associated bills, and I want to associate myself with the remarks made by my Greens colleague Senator Peter Whish-Wilson, who has been a longstanding, passionate advocate for waste reduction and recycling. I have a strong commitment to moving us towards zero waste and a circular economy. I've had that commitment for a long time through my work in the New South Wales parliament and before that in my role as environmental manager in local governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this bill in front of us bans waste export, which is really good, this bill is nowhere near enough to deal with the mountains of waste that we produce. The truth of the matter is that we should never have been exporting waste in the first place. I think many Australians were alarmed when they found out about this. If waste is produced here, it should be dealt with here. 'Out of sight, out of mind' is not going to cut it anymore. If the government is really serious about addressing the waste crisis, these bills are not the solution; they are just window-dressing for the problem. Banning waste exports is not going to help us crawl out of the mountains of waste that we produce and neither is recycling by itself. Being serious about waste means starting at the top of the waste hierarchy by avoiding and reducing waste, then moving on to reuse and repair, and then recycling and so on. The least preferred option, of course, is disposal. These bills do nothing to reduce waste. These bills do nothing to make product stewardship mandatory, nothing to ensure that the producers of the waste have the responsibility for it and nothing to address the problem of plastics pollution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I say a little more on these issues, I want to highlight the size of the problem that we face. To start the story of waste, let's get a snapshot of what we produce, recycle and dump. Australia produced about 76 million tonnes of waste in 2018-19. That's at least five million full garbage trucks every single year. To enable you visualise that, Madam Deputy President: if those trucks were lined up they would form a queue of about 40,000 kilometres, which is well over the length of the whole coastline of Australia. That's the extent of the problem that we are facing. According to MRA Consulting, between 1996 and 2015 our population increased by 28 per cent while our waste generation increased by 170 per cent. That's a compound growth rate of about eight per cent a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our waste habits also have a significant impact on the climate crisis, first through the use of energy and material to satisfy our appetite for production and consumption and then through the methane that is produced from landfill when we bury our discards. Methane is much more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. That only exacerbates the climate emergency that we are already in. While there is no doubt, when you look at the numbers in our state of the environment reports, that the rate of recycling has definitely increased over the years, the total amount of waste has also increased, and that is the crux of the problem. We can't keep on producing more and more, throwing it out and then hoping to recycle our way out of this mountain of rubbish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Waste and recycling was brought into the public focus just a few years ago with a <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> expose, aptly called 'Trashed'. The program told us some things that we knew and some things that came as quite a shock to many of us, especially the revelation that possibly half of all the waste that we thought was being recycled was ending up in landfill or as stockpiled material in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. We found out that what we were diligently separating for recycling at home wasn't being recycled at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is deeply concerning that, rather than focusing on the root causes of waste and how to manage it, governments have decided to go down the path of unsustainable, polluting alternatives like waste incinerators. In New South Wales alone there are proposals for five waste incinerators. If built, these garbage incinerators will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, poisoning our air with dioxins, furans, heavy metals and fine particles such as PM2.5 and PM10, putting in danger the health of communities living in their vicinity. There is a real concern that these waste burners could effectively monopolise waste disposal as well. What might end up happening is that material that could be reused or recycled is burnt in incinerators instead. To meet the appetite of these burning machines, more waste will be produced, not less. These incinerators have absolutely zero social licence. They have been thoroughly rejected by the community. When I was in the New South Wales parliament, I was part of a massive community campaign to push back on the gigantic world's largest toxic waste incinerator proposed for Eastern Creek in Western Sydney. Because of the courage of the community, it was knocked back by the department of planning, the New South Wales EPA, NSW Health and the parliamentary inquiry that I sat on. The Independent Planning Commission drove the final nail in the coffin of this waste burner. Melinda Wilson, spokesperson for Western Sydney Direct Action, was recently reported as saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Why and how can a project already rejected by the Independent Planning Commission (IPC) come back again, five-fold? Why did the Minister not accept the IPC's advice and reject these incinerators once and for all?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She's right. The risks to human health and the environment are serious and irreversible. These incinerators are no solution to the waste problem. Energy from burning rubbish is not renewable, clean or green. These big, dirty waste polluters have recently been banned in the ACT, and rightly so. The federal government should show leadership and at least stop any public funding going to these waste incinerators. This legislation is an opportunity to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are talking about ways in which the federal government can show leadership, let's talk about plastics. One hundred and eighty million plastic bags find their way into the environment every year, and microplastics have been found in the majority of drinking water supplies all around the world. Conservative estimates have stated that there are currently five trillion pieces of plastic on the surface of oceans and an additional eight million tonnes of plastics entering oceans every single year. This is the equivalent of one garbage truck of plastic every minute of every day of the year. Australia alone produces over 2.5 million tonnes of plastic per year. That's a huge addition to the global plastic pollution problem. In 2018-19, nine per cent of plastic was sent to be recycled, while a whopping 84 per cent was sent to landfill. A worrying amount of this waste ends up on our streets and in our waterways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impacts of plastics are devastating to our marine life, such as seabirds, dolphins, seals and turtles. I want to thank the wonderful people who work at facilities like the Australian Seabird Rescue in Ballina, where they rescue and rehabilitate marine animals and seabirds that have usually been injured after ingesting plastic. They also educate schoolchildren to reduce the use of plastics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2015 Senate committee report into the threat of marine plastic pollution stated that there are worrying gaps in our knowledge about the effects of marine plastic pollution. This includes the impacts on population levels of native animals, the effects on human health of plastics in the food chain, as well the short- and long-term effects of microplastics. If the Prime Minister really wants to tackle the plastic pollution problem—and he should do this with gusto—then this bill must be amended to address plastics. I know that some state governments are moving to ban single-use plastics. But right here, right now, the federal government has the opportunity to show some guts. Let's not let this chance slip away from us. At the end of the day, we need to urgently reduce production and consumption, and make big strides away from being a throwaway society. Instead of starting at the bottom-of-the-waste hierarchy with landfilling, burning waste and recycling, why not start at the very top, with waste avoidance? Even better, let's look at it from the perspective of material and resource management rather than waste management. On the other side of the waste coin is the unbridled use of precious natural resources like our forests and water. There are many tools available for us to do this. For example, approaches like mandatory extended producer responsibility—which makes producers of goods responsible for their full life cycle—have been quite successful in reducing material use, extending a product's life and making it easier to reuse, repair and recycle. Basically, the attitude of the industry must be to design for the environment. If it can't be fixed, reused or recycled, don't make it. The repair economy is also something really worth investing in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Waste is a hot topic at the moment, and we should reignite the conversation about drastically reducing and eliminating waste. While the idea of zero waste can be daunting, according to the Zero Waste International Alliance:0</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Zero Waste is a goal that is both pragmatic and visionary, to guide people to emulate sustainable natural cycles, where all discarded materials are resources for others to use. Zero Waste means designing and managing products and processes to reduce the volume and toxicity of waste and materials, conserve and recover all resources, and not burn or bury them. Implementing Zero Waste will eliminate all discharges to land, water, or air that may be a threat to planetary, human, animal or plant health</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what we all should be trying to do. There is an overwhelming appetite in the community to reduce waste, but we need the government to step in and step up—to play a role. Local councils are at the forefront of waste management but need the state and federal governments to come to the party with funding, support and policy that signals a shift to the words voiding, reducing and reusing waste This bill should not be a wasted opportunity. The time to act is now.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  In September last year, in my first senator's statement, I said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our oceans are choking with plastic and other waste, yet conversations within our community are repetitive, and action needs to move at a quicker pace.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is a great privilege to stand in this chamber today to speak on the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and related bills. What a time to get the opportunity to debate and pass this important legislation. Just last month we celebrated National Recycling Week, which is designed to engage with all Australians on the importance of recycling. This year's theme was 'Recovery—A future beyond the bin', which is about closing the recycling loop and buying products made with recycled content.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing private industry play a significant role in the reduction of single-use products. In my home state of Victoria we are seeing innovative companies, such as one that I'm very familiar with, called Returnr, which was founded by one of the co-founders of KeepCup, starting to see market growth on the back of developing ways to reduce single-use plastics with reusable solutions in the takeaway food industry. These local businesses are recognising that local communities, businesses and families have an important role to play in global sustainability. This approach needs pragmatic, sensible outcomes and not just virtue signalling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill is a wonderful example of a pragmatic, sensible approach to increasing our recycling and reducing the amount of waste that we send to landfill. One thing that we know for sure is that Australians want to be confident that when they put their bin out on the kerb everything will be collected and recycled. Australians do not want to see their recycling sent to landfill, shipped overseas or stored illegally to become a fire hazard that could explode in a fire at any minute. As the Prime Minister has said: it's our waste; it's our responsibility. That is why this government, under the leadership of Scott Morrison and the tireless efforts of Minister Ley and Assistant Minister Evans, has introduced this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will implement the waste export ban agreed by Australian governments in March this year and reform the Product Stewardship Act 2011. The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill will phase out Australia's offshoring of 645,000 tonnes of plastic, paper, glass and tyres. It is important to remember that whenever we export our waste overseas we are essentially passing our rubbish on to other countries to deal with. The phasing out of Australia exporting its waste will ensure that it is dealt with here. It is our waste, and we bear the responsibility for ensuring that the highest waste recycling standards are met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To meet the increase in waste being dealt with onshore, we must develop and transform Australia's recycling capabilities and capacities. To do so, the Morrison government is leading a billion dollar transformation of our waste and recycling industry. We are achieving this by helping to build onshore demand for recycled content and helping industry to invest in innovative technology to deal with it. These efforts will create more than 10,000 much-needed jobs and divert over 10 million tonnes of resources from landfill. As I said at the start of my speech, this bill will deliver a pragmatic and sensible approach to increasing our recycling and reducing the amount of waste which is sent to landfill, which is why the next aspect of the bill really excites me. At the same time as phasing out our export waste, we're also introducing reforms to the regulation of product stewardship. These reforms will incentivise companies to take greater environmental responsibility for the products they manufacture, including at the end of the product's life. As we on this side are very good at, it is a combination of carrot and stick: investing in greater environmental responsibility at the time of manufacturing while also investing in Australia's recycling capacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As senators in this place are aware, I am a member of the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee, which considered this bill in great detail. One of the things that really stuck with me throughout the inquiry was how supportive Australian industry, business, green groups and local communities have been towards the waste export ban. All of these groups are supportive of this ban because they see it as a positive catalyst for change. The Morrison government sees it as an opportunity for change as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned Returnr before. It's a business that is shaking up the takeaway industry with their reusable products. But now I want to mention two other great businesses, in the fashion industry, who are also doing their bit to reduce waste. Newly back in Australian hands, RM Williams is offering $150 off new boots if you exchange your old boots. All traded RMs will be restored and replenished for future resale. The clothing brand MJ Bale will slash $200 off any new suit when you bring your old suit in to be donated to Moving the Needle, which is a business collaboration between Australian Red Cross, The Salvation Army and St Vincent's, or St Vinnies. These businesses are tackling the challenge of dealing with waste and recycling head-on and, at the same time, supporting charities and ensuring more Australians have access to great Australian fashion. As a Senate, we should congratulate them for undertaking these initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is striving to support these businesses that are supporting our waste export ban. We've introduced the most significant package of policies and funding commitments on recycling and waste ever brought forward by a federal government. We've introduced the National Waste Policy Action Plan, which will achieve, amongst many things, an 80 per cent average recovery rate across all waste streams and a significant increase in procurement of recycled materials, and it will halve the amount of organic waste sent to landfill. In addition, we are leading substantial investment in recycling through the new $190 million Recycling Modernisation Fund. This fund will use its power to leverage $600 million of new investment in recycling infrastructure. We are providing $35 million to deliver on the Commonwealth elements of the National Waste Policy Action Plan and $24.6 million to improve our waste data. These investments complement our already comprehensive $167 million Australian recycling investment plan. This plan includes $100 million under the Clean Energy Finance Corporation for large-scale projects using clean energy technologies to support the recycling of waste products; $20 million for the National Product Stewardship Investment Fund to kickstart product stewardship action; and Australia's first National Plastics Summit, which was hosted by this government in March and mobilised major pledges from leading companies including the Pact Group, Nestle, McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Coles. The outcomes from the summit will help inform Australia's national plastics plan and achieve a phase-out of problematic and unnecessary plastics over the next five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government have a strong and positive story to tell on our efforts to reduce waste and increase recycling, and I'm proud to tell that story in this place. Our policies will reduce waste, incentivise the recycling industry and lift recycling rates. They'll tackle plastics pollution in our oceans and waterways. They'll ensure we build a healthy recycling and resource recovery industry in Australia. However, most importantly, we will give Australians the confidence that what they put in their recycling bin will actually be recycled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Waste is not just an environmental problem to solve; it is an economic opportunity, and, because of the initiatives included in this bill, business will seize the opportunity to re-use and recycle, and they will do it here, at home in Australia. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020, and in doing so associate myself with the comments already put forward by the Greens spokesperson on waste and recycling, who, of course, is Senator Whish-Wilson. Senator Whish-Wilson has been an avid supporter for a proper recycling and waste management industry in this country, and I think it's fair to say that we wouldn't be here, where we are today, debating this piece of legislation if it weren't for the work of Senator Whish-Wilson.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, of course, that reducing waste is and must be the goal that all of us strive and advocate for. We need to be reducing waste. We need to be reducing the stuff that makes waste. I think our lives—and many people would reflect upon this—are just increasingly full of stuff. There's stuff we don't really need, stuff that doesn't last long enough and stuff that, at the end of it, we think: 'How did we end up with this? What do we do with it now?' That is why we need a proper management system that is fully circular. We need to be reducing the amount of crap that's made that isn't recyclable, that isn't actually reusable and perhaps think about whether we need it in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be making sure that when we do put in place systems that deal with the waste that we have that it is done in the most environmentally friendly and sustainable manner. We need to stop producing in this country and, indeed, around the world single-use plastic, and if you can't reuse something we shouldn't be creating it. That, I think, is the principle that we need going forward, because there is a lot of rubbish out there already that we don't know how we're going to manage. The last thing we need to be doing is creating more of it to make it even harder to deal with the problems at hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that our oceans are choking. We know that our waterways are polluted. We know that our animals are dying because of the amount of plastic, rubbish and toxic waste that they have ingested. We know that animals are being caught and strangled because of the rubbish that is left in our rivers and winds up in our oceans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sea Shepherd Australia has been running beach clean-ups around the country, and I've been to a number of them in my home state of South Australia. Since 2016, Sea Shepherd Australia has hosted nearly 700 beach and remote clean-ups, joining with over 28,000 members of the community. It is just incredible, when you go to these beach clean-ups, where you put aside two or three hours and walk out with buckets, tongs and gloves, the amount of rubbish that is collected over one simple morning. Children, in particular, are gobsmacked at the amount of rubbish that they find, and children are the ones who are really calling on us as adults and as leaders to take serious action on this front.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For far too long Australia has not cared about the rubbish it creates and where it goes. This legislation is a step in the right direction. It's starting to deal with this terrible pollution problem we have, but it isn't the final solution and it isn't the only answer. We still have many more steps to take. One of them of course is banning single-use plastics. We have to stop creating this crap. We have to stop creating this rubbish. We have to deal with the plastic that we have already.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to be putting in place systems that ensure that disposal of the waste is done in the most environmentally sound and sustainable way. While this legislation is a step in the right direction, I am concerned about the hole in this legislation that would act as a perverse incentive for the incineration of waste. Why am I concerned about that? We need a clear statement from this government that the aim is to reduce the amount of pollution and to reduce the amount of toxic waste. Allowing for the incineration of plastic in order to get rid of it is going to create even more problems for us in the future, particularly as we tackle the very serious environmental crisis of climate change and carbon pollution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know we need to be getting out of fossil fuels. We have to stop burning fossil fuels. The last thing we want to do is create a perverse incentive by saying, 'You can create more plastic and we'll create a market mechanism to ensure you can keep burning it,' because that is simply burning oil and fossil fuels and creating more pollution. That's not the pathway we want to take. That is why I move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After all we know about the rubbish that is clogging our oceans and waterways, which takes so long to deal with, the last thing we want to do is create an incentive for vested interest not to reduce the amount of plastic that's produced but to simply put it in an incinerator, burn it and claim that this is some type of clean energy production. It is not. It is toxic and backwards. That is not the fully circular waste management agenda that we need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't get me wrong. I understand that across the country we've become better and better at dealing with the gases that come out of landfill. In fact, there are many ways that the gas coming out of landfill is being captured and turned into energy. But we don't want to see a market created because of loopholes in the law and because the wrong signal is being sent by government. We don't want to see a bunch of companies set up to make a quick buck by burning the plastic in an incinerator and turning it into energy. We need to be reducing the amount of plastic we produce in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the landfill-to-energy programs that already exist in Australia have taken the best available science from around the world, particularly places like Germany. They rely on the anaerobic digestion system. This is taking green organic waste and, rather than having the toxic gas released into the atmosphere, capturing that gas and turning it into energy. I understand that, and of course it needs to continue, because we do have this organic matter in landfill. But there is a very big difference between that and setting up a market that is supported by government, whether through regulation or financial support or incentives, that sends a signal that you can keep producing as much plastic as you want if these guys over here are going to make money by burning it and creating pollution. That is not the pathway that we need to take.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I urge the crossbench, I urge the government and I urge the opposition to support my second reading amendment in relation to this, because we have to draw a line in the sand somewhere. I've listened to a number of the contributions from senators on all sides in relation to this legislation, and I think it's fair to say that there is goodwill in relation to dealing with waste and recycling and protecting our environment. Let's not undo all of that goodwill and that good work by providing an incentive for some cowboys out there in the industry who want to keep making plastic so that they can burn plastic waste and sell it as power. That's going to create more pollution. It doesn't deal with the issue of plastics choking our waterways and our oceans, and it doesn't deal with the fundamental issue that we have: we create too much crap and we don't recycle or reuse enough of it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to make sure that we get back to basics: reduce, reuse, recycle. Of course, if we do all of this properly, what do we create? We create green jobs, the greenest jobs available. There is a huge industry that is desperate for support to ensure that we deal with waste in a circular process. But all of that will be undercut if we allow, through this legislation, a loophole that provides a perverse incentive for cowboys out there in the industry to make a quick buck by burning plastics and creating pollution. So I urge the government to consider this and not to let that happen. I commend the bills to the parliament, but I urge that those actions in relation to the second reading amendment be taken on board and supported by the government.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  A year and a half ago I found myself on another one of my North Queensland trips to speak with a company that has developed a method of recycling farm plastics, which are often used for crops like tomatoes, strawberries and melons. For those of you who aren't familiar with farming, at the end of every season the crops are cut back and thousands of kilometres of this black plastic is ripped up and rolled into giant balls that were once upon a time dumped into landfill. This happened on thousands of farms across Australia each year, so you can only imagine how much plastic was ending up in the ground. Once the dumping practice ended, farms were just storing unmeasurable numbers of these plastic bales, which were a ticking time bomb for firebugs and environmental damage on prime agricultural land. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might ask why this plastic wasn't being recycled in the first place. The problem farmers faced was that, when they'd ripped the plastic up from the moist soil below, dirt would stick to the plastic. The dirt was enough to contaminate the recycling process, so therefore the bales of plastic would just get stored in the corner of a farm. But along came this young bloke, Cory Towner, who was young achiever of the year for showing us that the device he'd developed not just ripped up the black plastic but removed the soil and green matter. His biggest impediment was that he couldn't find the financial support to build these devices on a commercial scale. I was so impressed by what he'd developed that I helped him by becoming an ambassador for his company. I'm not sure too many other senators in this parliament have put their money where their mouths are when it comes to recycling. It would be interesting to ask the Greens how many of them own shares or an interest in a recycling company.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's face it, we all have a responsibility to deal with rubbish and recycling in this country, but we'd have a whole lot less to deal with if we weren't buying in cheap goods from countries like China. My generation and older, as well as those who are probably in their early to mid 40s know what recycling is about. My father's garage had shelves of re-used pickle jars full of screws and God knows what else he kept in there. He was the kind of man who could fix just about anything around the house. The other side of the coin was that our pantry had glass jars repurposed for jams that Mum would make out of fruit we grew in the backyard. We'd take the glass soft-drink bottles back to the store for a credit or refund, or donate them to the local Scouts group. We drank from a tap when we were thirsty; we didn't buy water in plastic bottles. When we went for weekend drives, we put boiled water in a flask and made our coffee or tea in the old enamel cups, not throwaway takeaway cups. And we bought quality. We bought Australian made appliances for the house, not this cheap crap we see on the shelves that lasts 12 months if you're lucky.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 talks about the action plan aimed at driving change in industry, business, governments and the community to turn waste into reusable commodities. I'm sorry, but I can't think of anything useful to do with a $7.50 Kmart toaster that breaks, or burns someone's house down. Nor can I see how a $9 BigW sandwich maker can be turned into a re-usable commodity. These are just two examples of the cheap rubbish we are being sold in stores across Australia. Most of these dead household items just end up in landfill. We bury it—out of sight, out of mind. Let's face it, there's very little worth in keeping a cheap $7.50 cordless kettle from Kmart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill states that it intends to regulate the export of waste material 'which is likely to have a negative impact on the environment or human health in the receiving country'. But where's the regulation to stop the importation of cheap material that is likely to harm the environment or human health in our country—in Australia? As far as I'm concerned, the bulk of what we're sending back is their rubbish sent here to begin with. Take solar panels, for example. Here in Australia we can't do a single thing with dead cells. We're burying them, and all of that cadmium, lead and other toxic chemicals eventually leach into the soil and into waterways. The same goes for other renewable energy sources, like wind turbines. So you're screaming out for more solar panels and more wind turbines in the country, but no-one's told me how you intend to get rid of them. What are we going to do with them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the Greens might find this difficult to comprehend, but I've been working with the Turnbull and Morrison governments for about three years to enable the world's first commercial recycling plant for asbestos. Asbestos is one of the most deadly materials that a dump and a community will deal with not only in this country but right across the globe. This thermochemical plant that I've taken to the government has been approved by environmental agencies in the United States and the European Union, but not here in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian company EnviroMaster is being held up by a second feasibility study because of bureaucracy and government departments. They've been forced to undertake two feasibility studies worth more than $12 million. It's the usual red tape we hear about that's helping to continue the trend of digging giant holes and burying thousands of tonnes of this deadly material each week—and this is happening every single day in suburban areas, like my old home town of Ipswich. You heard it here first: Australia has a way of recycling asbestos. But we continue to bury it as best practice, which, as it stands, has an eternal legacy. We can thank federal and state government bureaucrats who feel the need to stifle this new technology, which has already been approved in the United States and Europe. If I knew the names of these bureaucrats I'd name them here, because they're doing a great job proving to taxpayers why they hate dealing with government departments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia could do much more recycling if—I emphasise 'if' for a reason—it had cheaper energy. But because we're not prepared to build more coal-fired power stations we've been forced to send glass and other recycled products overseas, where energy costs are at least half that of Australia's. Again, these bills are just a part of the solution to better recycling here in Australia. Both Senator Roberts and I will be supporting the legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and the package of related legislation collectively represent a giant and gaping missed opportunity to tackle the waste crisis that is engulfing not only our country but in fact the entire world. As the Senate inquiry into these bills made abundantly clear, these bills do not go nearly far enough to tackle the waste crisis. Let's be clear: this is an absolute crisis. Microplastics have been found in the deepest parts of our oceans. They are leeching into the waterways and oceans on every part of our planet and they are choking and poisoning our ecosystems, in particular our marine ecosystems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've all seen the shocking photos and images of giant drifts of plastics, whether they are lapping up on beaches, packed so solidly that you cannot even see the water, or whether they have congealed into giant mid-ocean rafts. This terrible habit that we have collectively got into of using fossil fuels—and, remember, plastic is generated from fossil fuels—to create products that we use but once and then dispose of simply by chucking them out the car window into the ocean when we're down at the beach or off the sides of our vessels has to end. We are choking the planet and its ecosystems with plastic. We know that fossil fuel companies are cooking our planet, but, when you remember that the people who make plastic are also fossil fuel companies, they're not just cooking our planet; they are choking our planet with rubbish and with microplastics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills are completely inadequate. I want to congratulate Senator Whish-Wilson on the way he has engaged with this legislation and on the amendments he has developed, and I commend his amendments to the chamber. On some of the flaws in this legislation: it overlooks plastic packaging, which is one of the biggest sources, if not the biggest source, of the plastic waste problem. The bills contain no mandatory targets. You would have thought we would have learned from history, which shows us clearly that simply asking big corporations to modify their behaviour is not going to work when they believe that the changes required to modify their behaviour will impact on their bottom line, on their profits. It's blindingly obvious. It happens time after time after time. When we bring in these voluntary codes of conduct for corporations, they are almost never adhered to. What we need is legislated targets here to make sure that corporations do what they should be doing for the public good and to look after nature on our planet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a general principle, humanity simply cannot continue to create as much waste as we do, we cannot afford to continue to burn as much waste as we do, and we certainly cannot afford to continue disposing of waste in the way that we do and in the quantities that we do. Of course, as with so many of the topics we debate in this place, the good news is that we can actually have a win-win here. We can look after nature, marine ecosystems, our environment and our climate and create jobs at the same time. Looking after waste is incredibly job intensive. We need to make sure that we've got enough jobs for people who want them in this country, and currently we don't. Despite all the spin that we'll get from the government benches, there are simply fewer jobs in Australia than there are people who want to work. That's not a controversial statement; that is simply a statement of fact. So why wouldn't we look to create jobs in areas where jobs have extra benefits over and above the simple creation of work—looking after nature, looking after our oceans and reversing the climate breakdown, for example?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Greens have been talking about significant investment into the infrastructure that will reduce waste and help to rebuild our domestic recycling industry, because we've got lazy over the last few decades in this country. Overwhelmingly, we've made decisions to not invest into a domestic recycling industry but instead to export our recyclable products overseas. For various reasons, that hasn't worked, and particularly in recent years it's worked less and less. So let's invest into rebuilding our domestic recycling industry so that we can create jobs and address one of the most significant environmental issues facing our planet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course the Greens want mandatory product stewardship and a national container deposit scheme, but we also want to phase out single-use plastics. I'll tell you now: when the history of this time is written, there are going to be some pretty big villains writ large in those pages, and those villains are going to be the people who dug in and resisted real climate action, the coal huggers and gas sniffers of this place. They're going to be some of the biggest villains, and they're the people who, when they're retired out of this place, are going to have to answer to their children and in particular to their grandchildren. But it's not just the fossil fools who are going to have to answer those questions; it is those who either stood in the way of meaningful action on waste or put forward solutions which are not strong enough to deal with the problem and then claimed that in fact they were dealing with those problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have to phase out single-use plastics. How are we going to explain to our grandchildren that we allowed mass marine extinctions and micoplastics to permeate every underwater crevice on this planet, simply because we kept using fossil fuels to generate plastics which were used once and then cast aside to pollute our oceans in the long term?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Addressing our waste crisis will take real leadership. It will take leadership far, far above and beyond the mere tinkering that is encapsulated in the government's legislation. What real leadership would look like would be leadership that did in fact phase out single-use plastics and that did introduce mandatory product stewardship so that the corporations that create the waste are ultimately responsible for managing it right through to the end of its life. Real leadership would look like a national container deposit scheme, and real leadership would look like significant investment into rebuilding our domestic recycling industry. Our land environments and our marine environments, which are already under massive pressure because our climate is breaking down around us, are also under pressure because of the massive amounts of waste that we generate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to see a circular economy with a booming and productive recycling industry. We need to put the onus on companies that are creating this problem to take responsibility for fixing or for being part of fixing these problems. I will tell you now: if you make it cheaper for companies to change their behaviour, rather than simply engage in the status quo, they will take that option. If you make companies pay for the end-of-life management of plastic products, for example, then it might become cheaper for them not to use the plastic in the first place. That's what we want to see. We want—in fact, we not only want but need—to see companies changing their behaviour. We need to see them phasing out single-use plastics. We can do that at the corporate level, and we should do it at the corporate level. We can also do it at the community level, and I want to give a  shout-out to Ben Kearney, who led the campaign for and the ultimately successful introduction of a ban on plastic bags in the township of Coles Bay, one of Tasmania's premier tourist towns. Ben, as part of that community, had the conversations that he needed to have, built the community support that he needed to build, and, ultimately, Coles Bay became the first town in the country to ban single-use plastic shopping bags—a small but extremely significant step that shows that we can do this if we're prepared to make the effort and put in the work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time, undoubtedly, to take far, far bigger steps than what the government is proposing in its legislation. It is time to get serious about addressing these problems. We owe it to nature and to all the beautiful creatures, whether they be seabirds or aquatic mammals choking to death on plastic beer can holders or ingesting dozens of plastic bags a day and dying because their digestive systems can't cope with them. We owe it to nature to look after nature, but we also owe it to ourselves. We owe it to humanity and we owe it to all the people who believe we should have a clean environment and respect nature so that nature can continue to look after us. Let's end these small steps from the government. Let's put in place a policy framework that would actually give us a chance at significantly addressing what is certainly a major problem that we are facing. That's why the Greens amendments to be moved by Senator Whish-Wilson are so important. They show the pathway to the kind of leadership that we collectively need and that every person on this planet collectively needs so that we can get on top of one of the biggest environmental challenges facing humanity.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  I rise to speak on the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and related bills, but I must also rise to speak about the protection of our lands and waters from waste. For our people, the connection we feel to country and waters can be difficult for settlers to understand. Our connection to country is about our identity as the First Peoples of this continent. Our connection to country and water is about the interdependent relationship between us, as people, and our ancestral lands, seas, oceans and rivers. As our old people continue to teach us, if we look after country, country will look after us. Our relationship with country is sustained by our cultural knowledge, our traditions and the wisdom of our old people. Not just are our people from country; we are of country. Unlike the settlers to this country, who felt that they could steal it, plant their colonial flags and claim these lands as their own, our people do not own the land; the land owns us. And that's why we look after it. Not to know our country and its stories, songs and songlines, its healing places and places of cultural significance causes our people pain. It impacts our health, wellbeing and identity. Our connection to country is our connection to our ancestors and their knowledge. It's this connection that allows our people to identify who they are, who their family are, who their mob are and who their ancestors, elders and totems are, and it guides our children on who they will be. This is why country must be protected from logging, from the mass extinction currently underway and from waste and pollution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our people never consented to our lands being taken or our oceans being choked with pollution. Before you fellas came, we cared for country for over 80,000 years. Today, 80 per cent of maritime debris in our waters is plastic rubbish. As a Gunnai Gunditjmara woman, both my countries have the most beautiful coastlines and beaches of anywhere in the world—not just best in the country but in the whole world. Places that are now called Ninety Mile Beach, the Tambo and Mitchell rivers, Lakes Entrance, Portland, Port Fairy and the beaches along the Great Ocean Road used to be pristine places that were abundant with food and shelter for our people. But studies have clearly shown that the majority of all plastic pollution found on the beaches in this country is produced and consumed locally. At the moment, we recycle only 16 per cent of plastic packaging; the rest ends up as waste or in rivers and oceans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I heard this government was introducing a waste reduction bill, I thought: 'Great! Surely the government will do the right thing and ban single-use plastics like the many plastic straws and plastic cutlery choking our waters.' Have you seen the story of the turtle that had a straw up its nose and the excruciating pain it went through to get that straw out of its nose? I thought: 'Of course they will reduce plastic packaging and introduce really strong measures to reduce the amount of plastic entering our oceans. Surely the government will mandate compostable recycling.' But, no, these bills do none of that, because the government don't want to do the right thing; they just want to look like they're doing something. I'm not at all surprised that a government led by the marketing department is pulling a marketing stunt. I hope that for Christmas this year the government get a little bit of shame as a present. When given the opportunity to introduce once-in-a-decade waste and recycling laws, they didn't even deal with plastic packaging. They tried; they just didn't try enough.</span>

Our reforms to the application of the new childcare subsidy provided billions of dollars in additional support that was targeted to ensure that the more hours somebody works, the greater the number of hours of subsidised child care they and their family are entitled to and that the less that they earn, the greater the rate of subsidy that they get. It seems quite remarkable that the Labor Party seem now to be adopting a policy position that is all about providing higher rates of support in terms of the childcare subsidy to those earning higher levels of income.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We absolutely want to make sure that the childcare system works to support Australian families. Under our reforms, over 70 per cent of families have out-of-pocket costs of less than $5 an hour and nearly a quarter are paying less than $2 an hour. Those families would be the lowest-income Australian families. We have targeted childcare subsidy support to give the greatest level of assistance to Australian families working the longest hours but earning the lowest amount of income.</span>

I note that the senator hasn't tried to give any of those sorts of details. He's constructed an example that doesn't actually allow anybody to compare whether it could be an 80 per cent or an 85 per cent rate of subsidy that is being paid. Indeed, in special circumstances, the government pays even more than that.</span>

We are budgeting $9 billion in expenditure to support child care in this financial year alone. This is about $2 billion—from memory—more than was being spent a couple of years ago prior to our reforms. We came along as a government, we introduced reforms to create the childcare subsidy, we increased the rate of spending on child care and that spending has now reached a point where in this financial year we will spend and invest $9 billion to support the hardest working Australian families, to give the greatest support to those earning the least amount of money, and yet those opposite come in here and they pretend that $9 billion is nothing at all! It's certainly not nothing at all!</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President. I'm still just as loud! COVID-19, as you know, has had an unprecedented impact on the labour market, but new research that's been released by the National Skills Commission on the Australian labour market shows that, while the impact of COVID-19 has been unprecedented, there are signs of recovery and cause for optimism for all Australians. We have begun the long road to recovery. In fact, we've seen 648,500 jobs return to the labour market since May. That is a good thing. Jobs are also returning in industries and occupations that have been impacted by COVID-19, in particular by the restrictions and the shutdowns. What we're also seeing in regional Australia is that job advertisements have been increasing by 17.6 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Skills Commission report is critical to our understanding of the future of Australia's labour market. It not only shows where the new jobs will be created but it also reinforces the Morrison government's work to not only make skills and vocational education more flexible but also more relevant to actual labour market demand. In other words, we're actually training people to ensure that they have those skills to get into a job. Since the election, we, the coalition government, the Morrison government, have focused on improving Australia's vocational and education training system. In fact, in this year alone we will now invest almost $7 billion in vocational education and training. We'll make the changes to this sector to ensure that the training that Australians are undertaking is relevant and fit for purpose. As we emerge from the economic impact of COVID-19, the government will utilise the National Skills Commission, which of course we legislated, to further ensure that our skills sector is properly responding to actual labour market needs.</span>

It's also an integral part of the government's JobMaker plan. All states and territories came on board with the co-investment. It's all about providing free or low-cost training to jobseekers and young people, including school leavers. The key to the training, though, is that we have worked individually with the states and territories to determine what their individual labour market demand is, and the JobTrainer courses, the free or low-cost training, actually reflect what is in demand in the states' and territories' labour markets themselves. Our goal as a government is to ensure that Australians receive qualifications in areas of skills demand. In other words, they are training for where the jobs are.

As Senator Ruston has made clear time and time again, the government is always willing to respond in confidence in relation to individual cases to ensure that they are treated appropriately and assessed and handled appropriately. When senators come in here with these sorts of questions, it's difficult to respond to the personal circumstances without the full details. However, in relation to all of these matters, the government has worked through them. It has worked through the different issues in relation to the debts that were raised and has provided—</span>

This program obviously had issues that have been dealt with and have resulted in repayments appropriately being made, where necessary.</span>

The government's strong view is that ASEAN is at the heart of Australia's vision for an open, inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific region in which sovereign states are able to make independent choices. It's a vision which is closely aligned with the principles set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">ASEAN outlook </span><span style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> the Indo-Pacific</span>. And we've continued to deepen our engagement with our South-East Asian neighbours. Indeed, at the ASEAN-Australia summit last month, the Prime Minister announced a major investment of over $500 million in economic development and security measures to support South-East Asia's recovery from COVID-19. It's a package which is aligned with ASEAN's priorities under the <span style="font-style:italic;">ASEAN outlook</span>—maritime, connectivity, sustainable development, economic cooperation. We welcome the agreement also to increase the tempo of our leaders' meetings to annual summits because that opens up a new chapter in the ASEAN-Australia strategic partnership. </span>

I also met with Vietnam's Ambassador to Australia last week and took the opportunity to particularly thank Vietnam for their leadership of ASEAN during a very difficult year, concerning the impact of COVID-19 in particular. Also, last week, I met virtually with my Malaysian counterpart on Friday, Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, and thanked Malaysia for their role as our ASEAN country coordinator.</span>

It is galvanising the region's response to the pandemic and, in particular, playing a central role in how our region will emerge from the crisis. A strong ASEAN is critical to the recovery and the future prosperity of Australia and the region. That's why we stand together in the challenges we face. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There have been constraints imposed on us by the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have of course continued our strong political engagement and dialogue with our partners in the region. As well as the Prime Minister's recent virtual attendance at the ASEAN-Australia summit this month, and also the East Asia Summit, the government, under the leadership of the trade minister, Minister Birmingham, has signed the Regional Comprehensive Partnership Agreement with 14 Indo-Pacific countries. I've met together with all of my ASEAN counterparts four times since June, including a special ASEAN-Australia foreign ministers meeting on 30 June to discuss our shared COVID-19 response, as well as of course the annual East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the ASEAN related meetings, both in September.</span>

That package announced by the Prime Minister includes investments for economic integration and development, high-quality infrastructure and support for our region's emerging security needs and for the development of maritime resources. The key elements include providing scholarships for emerging leaders, creating even more valuable people-to-people links, strengthening cybersecurity and critical technology capabilities, new funding to boost jobs and growth as part of the Vietnam-Australia Enhanced Economic Engagement Strategy and opening a new liaison office in Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar in 2021.

The 2019-20 bushfires resulted in about 450 deaths due to direct injury and air pollution exposure and they sent thousands of people to hospital emergency departments with respiratory and heart problems. Last November was the hottest November on record. Leading health bodies, including the AMA, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, the Australian College of Nursing and the majority of peak medical bodies, have declared climate change a health emergency. Will the government declare the climate crisis a health emergency?</span>

Senator Siewert, you would be aware that climate change is a global challenge for all countries, including Australia, and all of us need to take action to mitigate and adapt to its impacts. As part of the Australian government's response the Australian government is focused on developing a sustainable and responsive health system—you asked the Minister for Health the question—with a range of programs that can be expanded or operationalised to respond to emerging pressures, including those that are climate related.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the Australian government released its National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy in 2015. I'm sure you are aware, Senator Siewert, that the strategy recognises that in Australia national and subnational governments, businesses, households and communities all have different but important roles in managing climate risks, including those that impact on health and wellbeing. The National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework, which, as you know, was released in April 2019, provides the big picture for the work that government, industries, businesses, not-for-profits, communities and individuals in Australia must do together so that we can live successfully with these hazards, and the hazards that you have referred to in your question to me, for decades to come.</span>

They include the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, which, as you are aware, has identified climate change as a health protection priority. The committee has, in fact, asked its National Health Emergency Standing Committee to develop a national heat health framework.</span>

The government are committed to achieving this as soon as possible, and that is why we have put in place the practical actions that we are taking to ensure that we respond to climate change, which, as I've said, is a global challenge for all countries, including Australia. Unfortunately, the difference between those of us on the government side of the chamber and those in the Australian Greens is that we are putting in place practical actions to ensure that we tackle climate change. You, for some reason, just don't seem to like the practical actions that we're putting in place, and yet to date the practical actions that we have put in place have been successful.</span>

The Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability's report into COVID-19 found that the Morrison government was responsible for significant failings from the onset of the pandemic. The royal commission heard evidence that a disabled woman was bedridden for nine days, surviving only on muesli bars with no help for meals or care. How many Australians living with disability were left behind by the Morrison government and forced to survive without meals or care?</span>

For that reason, the government welcomed the interim report of the disability royal commission. We believe that absolutely everybody, but most particularly the government, has a huge role to play in stamping out violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of people with disability, so we thank the royal commission for the work it does. We set up the royal commission because we wanted to shine a spotlight on what is going on and to make sure that some of the actions of the past didn't happen in the future. </span>

The other side quickly forgets how extraordinary the circumstances were that we found ourselves in in March this year. Can I also acknowledge the respectful and collaborative way in which those at the other end of the chamber sought to work with me to provide me with information so that I knew what was going on in the sector. They didn't seek to come in here and publicise it. I acknowledge Senator Steele-John particularly, who picked up the phone regularly to raise issues with me that were of great concern to him, and we did our best to make sure that we resolved those. Just as a matter of some interest, I'd also point out that the royal commission did not speak to those who I would probably consider to be the two most senior public servants. It did not speak to the deputy secretary, disability or the CEO of the NDIA to get more information about the issues.</span>

Under the Morrison government, vulnerable Australians—from those in residential aged care to those living with disabilities—have been left neglected and abandoned by Mr Morrison. Why is Mr Morrison leaving behind Australians living with a disability and failing to keep them safe?</span>

But, as we recognise, the situation that we all found ourselves in this year was a once-in-a-century pandemic. I can tell you what I did, as the minister who has broader responsibility for disability, as opposed to the NDIS. I worked with the disability sector. I had numerous meetings, and I'd like to shout out to Ben Gauntlett, who is our Disability Discrimination Commissioner, for the extraordinary hard work that he did, along with the advocacy groups, to make sure that the voices of people with disability were heard during this time so that we could respond to the specific needs. Clearly, every Australian was faced with a situation that they had never seen before, and we worked very well with the disability sector. I acknowledge the huge amount of support they gave me.</span>

The Australian government used the weakest gas laws in the world to attract foreign oil and gas companies to exploit Australia's offshore deposits of natural gas. The government now receives approximately $200 million a year for the offshore natural gas taken from the North West Shelf, which drives tens of billions of dollars of exports, including to China, where we supply 10 per cent of their total energy requirements. Failure to get a fair payment for our offshore gas represents a gift of billions of dollars a year to foreign oil and gas companies. This is money better spent on Australians. What has stopped the government from implementing a single recommendation from the 2017 Callaghan report so Australia can be fairly paid for its offshore gas?</span>

At the outset, can I acknowledge her longstanding and passionate commitment to ensuring that Australians are the beneficiaries of our nation's endowment of natural resources. The government has worked very hard to strengthen the integrity of the petroleum resource rent tax by addressing the design issues that were contained within the Callaghan independent review. In fact, the government brought down its response to the Callaghan review on 2 November 2018. In that, we then worked to make sure that we implemented many of the recommendations that were contained in that review—things like reducing the uplift rates that apply to carried forward expenditure. We've also set up a process to address the remaining recommendations relating to the gas transfer pricing for LNG projects. Indeed, legislation giving effect to the key changes came into force on 1 July 2019 and will raise an additional $6 billion over the next decade. We are absolutely committed to supporting the resource sector, which has invested over $600 billion in Australian projects over the last decade. But, in doing so, we need to make sure that we strike the balance between ensuring that investors around the world know that Australia's doors are open for investment and ensuring that the national interest is being realised by making sure Australians are the beneficiaries of our resources.</span>

We will always make sure the national interest is served.</span>

I believe the Australian government, through a number of regimes, has always sought to make sure that Australians are the beneficiaries of resources that belong to all Australians. That's why we put in place a regime around the petroleum resource rent tax that was brought in by those opposite back in 1987, to make sure that these projects were providing benefit to Australians which, most importantly, included increasing the taxation revenue for Australia. As an example, the most recent data available from the Australian tax office says that the resources sector paid approximately $11.4 billion in company tax in 2017-18. I'm advised that, in 2018, Woodside alone paid $550 million in Australian corporate income tax and— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I also thank him for his enduring support of our men and women in uniform and for Defence. Building a stronger Australia post pandemic rests on a secure and stable Indo-Pacific. That is why defence is supporting not only our own national recovery from COVID-19 but also the recovery of our regional friends and partners.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already reoriented funding through the government's defence cooperation programs to assist our regional partners deal with COVID-19. This is in addition to the significant support that the ADF has provided on Operation COVID-19 Assist. Over 10,000 ADF members have been contributing to state and territory responses since the beginning of this year. In the South Pacific our support has focused on very targeted country specific priorities. This includes planning, health, logistics, vehicle and asset maintenance and the delivery of personal protective equipment and also supplies.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In South-East Asia, Australia has supported regional defence forces to respond to the pandemic. One example is a $2 million package of personal protective equipment to Indonesia's armed forces to support and assist in their ability to deal with their own nation's COVID-19 response. A second example is a total of $3 million of assistance to the Armed Forces of the Philippines to enable their ongoing support of infectious disease wards across the country and of their own armed forces personnel. In the Indian Ocean region we've provided personal protective equipment for the defence forces of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Defence stands firmly with its regional partners during these most challenging of times for us all.</span>

Throughout COVID-19 one of the proudest things our nation has seen is that the ADF have not missed a beat. Yes, we've had to adapt work practices but we have not missed a beat throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time Australia has continued to strengthen its military-to-military engagement with its partners—partners who share our vision for a stable, prosperous and rules based Indo-Pacific. This is despite the many challenges facing us all with COVID-19. For example, our regional presence deployment, which ran from July to September, was the largest-ever ADF deployment to the Indo-Pacific. We exercised with 11 nations in total. The Navy has conducted seven separate maritime activities with Japan alone this year. Australia participated in the Malabar maritime exercise last month with close partners India, Japan and the United States, and those exercises continue.</span>

In all seriousness, Defence is continuing to support our Pacific family to address the health and economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Work continues apace with Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Vanuatu on significant defence infrastructure projects in those nations that will enhance security and also provide much-needed economic stimulus and local employment opportunities in those nations. Those projects in those three countries alone are expected to create over 350 jobs in Papua New Guinea, 555 jobs in Fiji and 178 jobs in Vanuatu, with many more to come. Defence continues to deliver new Guardian class patrol boats throughout COVID-19, with eight to date to regional partners under the Pacific Maritime Security Program. In fact, Tonga received its second Guardian class patrol boat during a COVID-safe handover at Henderson in October. This program fundamentally supports regional sovereignty— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Laura, who is stranded in Spain and wants to come home, has had her status changed by DFAT to 'not seeking to return to Australia', despite making it clear to a caller from DFAT that she was trying to return as soon as possible and had flights booked in coming weeks. She said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have done is work with Services Australia to contact registered Australians to ensure that the information we have in our database is up to date and correct. Having detailed information assists us with planning for facilitated commercial flights. That includes the Qantas flight that arrived in Hobart yesterday from New Delhi. It also helps us to prioritise vulnerable Australians within the caps on incoming passenger arrivals. I don't know how those opposite suggest that we actually manage this process without having the most current information and without having up-to-date data from Australians.</span>

Of those, over 3,700 were vulnerable. We have been seeking information from those Australians to ensure that we are able to assist them with the most up-to-date and timely information. Since 23 October, we have facilitated 13 commercial flights, returning 1,847 passengers. In the last four weeks alone, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has made over 30,000 offers of places on flights to Australians registered overseas. This is a very complex process to assist Australians who are in very difficult circumstances in many cases; I absolutely acknowledge that. But, since 18 September, at least 43,000 Australians have been able to return from overseas. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The OECD has never been led by anybody from our region. But it does beggar the imagination that those opposite would seek to conflate their cheap political point with the important process of getting Australians back to Australia. I would suggest that the effort that the consular officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, that the effort that officials are making to return Australians, literally in every capital where Australians are located, and to support them, is a very, very focused and conscientious one. But we are operating in the middle of a pandemic. We are operating with quarantine caps; we are operating with flight restrictions, and we have returned over 43,800 Australians since— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We know that around the world COVID-19 is continuing to spread. Globally, we have now reached 66.4 million COVID-19 cases and, sadly, we have lost 1.5 million lives. We see that outside of Australia: the challenge of COVID-19 is significant and it is tragic. But when we look at the situation here in Australia, compared with other developed nations, we are in a very good position. In the United States, for example, the death rate is 23.9 times what we have seen in Australia. In the United Kingdom the death rate is over 25 times what we have seen in Australia. So our success in managing the health crisis, as a country and as a government, has built the foundation for our economic recovery. We've had real challenges and genuine loss, but the outcome that we are currently seeing in Australia is certainly one which other parts of the world envy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, we have now had 27,965 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and, sadly, 908 deaths. As of 4 pm yesterday, we have had zero cases of community transmission in the past 24 hours. Certainly, that is a good thing. In terms of our response to COVID-19, more than $18.5 billion has been committed to support the emergency COVID-19 health response. As a government, as you know, we took early action to close the borders and institute quarantine arrangements. We've established 147 GP respiratory clinics, and we've now conducted more than 10.1 million tests in Australia since the pandemic commenced.</span>

Certainly, in terms of the testing, as I've said, Australia has now conducted over 10.1 million COVID-19 tests. This has, indeed, been a critical component of our health success and our ability to track, trace and, as we've seen in the statistics that I referred the Senate to, contain the COVID-19 virus. The work that our health agencies have undertaken to build testing capacity is quite remarkable, and we congratulate them. When you consider that in January of this year there was no such thing as a COVID-19 test, when you look at the work of our health agencies and the fact that Australia has now conducted in excess of 10.1 million tests, they certainly deserve our thanks. We've also taken a number of steps to ensure that we could build this capacity, including putting in place Medicare funding for COVID-19 tests and sourcing the material needed to keep our testing supplies— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

While there are rapid rollouts, and we've certainly seen them announced last week around the world, the situation here in Australia is quite different. In fact, it's unique. Locally, the Therapeutic Goods Administration has given priority assessment to three different vaccines. The TGA is currently assessing all of the available medical evidence of these vaccines to verify that they are, indeed, safe for use in Australia. The safety of the vaccine program is, of course, our top priority as a government. We've made a deliberate decision to diversify our vaccine portfolio with a range of vaccines and all of the different data. The rollout of the Pfizer vaccine in the United Kingdom will provide us with additional information to assess the safety of the rollout of the vaccine in Australia.</span>

As I said in the chamber here last week, the youth unemployment rate, at 15.6 per cent, is too high. That's why this government has invested so much, which we have been criticised for by the opposition, in measures to support younger Australians to get back to work. In fact, the opposition has actually voted against some of those measures in this place. We recognised that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on younger Australians was going to be significant. That's why, as we worked our way through the COVID pandemic and in the budget that we released just a few weeks ago, we had such a significant effort focused towards getting younger Australians back to work. We invested $4 billion in the JobMaker hiring credit. We invested a significant amount of money to provide a 50 per cent wage subsidy for apprentices who were starting a new apprenticeship in businesses or recommencing. We want to keep younger Australians connected with their employers, and we want to provide incentives for employers to employ younger Australians, because we know the longer term effects of unemployment for younger Australians have a significant impact on their financial capacity over a period of time—</span>

We have invested in a number of measures to assist employers to take on younger Australians. We were criticised by those on the other side for focusing too much on younger Australians in our budget only a few weeks ago. They forget what they were saying just a few weeks ago, when they were criticising our budget for being so heavily focused on younger Australians and on assisting younger Australians to get back into work, with all of the programs that we put into place. We make no apology for focusing on younger Australians getting back to work. We recognise, as I said just a moment ago, that the impact on younger Australians who don't have work when they're young is over a longer period of time and more significant. We will do everything that we can to assist employers to get younger people back into work.</span>

Now, on the point of order, Senator Keneally, the minister did mention underemployment then, as you got to your feet. I did hear him talk about both. However, I have not had to ask a minister to stop answering a question. But, when I have a specific question that says, 'How many are?' and, 'When will it return?' that is factual in nature, without any political loading or phrasing in the question, that requires an answer to be directly relevant. A directly relevant answer is not a broad commentary on the topic. So I'm going to remind ministers of that, because I've always said that if questions are specific in nature, without political phrasing, then 'directly relevant' is a very strict test. Where questions actually include arguable phrases and loaded terminology, ministers are allowed to respond in kind, but this was a very specific question about 'how many' and 'when shall it return', without loading; I'm happy to be corrected if the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> shows me otherwise.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is hard to imagine what would actually provoke this government to meaningfully respond to women's economic interests, in particular, the significance and importance of Australian women having access to the labour market and consequently developing their own economic and financial independence, because the true meaning of 'independence' is the ability to find your way out of circumstances not of your choosing, to make real choices in the knowledge you have the economic resources to support you. The indifference to women's labour market participation, the indifference to their economic interests, the indifference to their wealth and the indifference to their super is absolutely remarkable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question on this occasion was about child care. For many families, the cost of child care is far too high. Childcare fees in Australia are amongst the highest in the OECD. In fact, our costs as a proportion of income are only eclipsed by a handful of other countries. It comes at a cost and it shows in our statistics, because high childcare fees are not only a hit to household budgets but act as a very, very significant barrier for parents, especially women, to return to work. The issue is that the childcare subsidy interacts with the personal tax system and the family tax benefit to mean that many mothers actually pay if they take on additional hours, and many more lose most of the additional income that they would obtain through working those hours. Women are being forced to reduce their working hours, missing out on career opportunities and advancement, missing out on superannuation, missing out on income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women need to balance earning enough money to afford these very high childcare fees but not so much that the childcare subsidy plummets and makes the experience of work financially pointless. The impact of this was shared by one young mother recently, who said: 'Realising it made more financial sense to work four days rather than five felt like an absolute blow. At no point did we consider my husband dropping down to four days. He has a secure job and his employer would not consider this. I, on the other hand, being a mum returning from leave, am nearly expected to be the one to request part-time employment.' And that young mum isn't alone, because her story is borne out again and again and again in the data. Data from the ABS shows that, of parents with a child younger than five, only 64 per cent of women were in the workforce compared with 95 per cent of men. And of those mothers who do work, 60 per cent of those are working part-time compared to only seven per cent of fathers. Even when children go to school, women continue to work part-time, and women are much more likely to be underemployed than men. One of the structural reasons for this low workforce participation amongst women is because of the high out-of-pocket costs of child care and the punitive tax rate that secondary income earners face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are facing very difficult economic circumstances. This is a time when governments all over the world are searching for solutions for growth, searching for solutions for productivity. If you want to increase Australia's productive capacity, it is pretty straightforward. There is an army of women out there, waiting for opportunities to work but on the condition that they actually are meaningfully financially rewarded for that contribution. You would think that it would be a policy priority for this government to consider their interests because it would be fair. It would not only be significantly fairer for those women but it would also be a good thing for the economy. It's a flat-out no-brainer. It is the most straightforward thing you could do to lift Australia's productive capacity. But there is zero interest, because this is a government run by men with almost no interest in the interests of women, who treat women's issues with contempt when they are raised, here in this chamber, at the estimates table, in the media. We get glib responses: 'Well, women are Australians; we look after all Australians.' I can tell you that is not what the data shows. The data shows women's economic interests are not improving. Women still face a gender pay gap. They face a super gap, they face a wealth gap, they face increasing rates of homelessness and, under this government, they face some of the highest childcare costs in the OECD.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  I wanted to start by responding to the last part of Senator McAllister's contribution where in attacking the coalition she ignores the record rates of female workforce participation in this nation under a coalition government. She ignores those inconvenient facts for herself. She talks about there being no women in this coalition government when we have the highest number of women in a cabinet in the history of our Commonwealth. Those criticisms should be seen for what they are, because they are not backed up by the facts. This government will always prioritise participation in the workforce for women, allowing families to make choices. That has been our government's record, that's what we'll continue to do and that's what our policies are directed at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You do have to take a step back—before I go into some of the stats re child care and the support that the coalition and the Morrison government has been giving to child care and to families accessing child care over a number of years—and ask the question when you hear from the Labor Party and their critique on child care: who does the modern Labor Party represent? They are arguing against a childcare policy which has absolutely prioritised those on low and middle incomes. This is the government that actually said we are going to give a higher rate of subsidy to those on low and middle incomes, yet we have a Labor Party who claims to represent workers and who would say: 'No. What you actually have to do is give more subsidies to those on very high incomes.' That is the Labor Party's policy and that is the Labor Party's critique when it comes to child care. When we hear this line of questioning and this line of attack from the Labor Party, I am reminded of the comments of Joel Fitzgibbon, when he said he wanted to put 'labour' back into the Labor Party, because it is extraordinary. I'm old enough to remember when people didn't have to say things like, 'Let's put "labour" back into the Labor Party,' because perhaps many years ago, perhaps when I was just a young man—a very young man—Labor may have had a reputation as actually supporting workers and perhaps a reputation, once upon a time, once perhaps in the distant past, as actually supporting low- and middle-income workers. But what we have is a modern Labor Party who has forgotten about those noble roots, dare I say it, of a once great Labor Party who used to represent those kind of workers and now needs to be reminded—</span>

Apart from agitating for drug law reform, mate, with your mates at university, I'm not really sure what your cred is on this. The modern Labor Party, I'll tell you, doesn't have a lot of cred. When it comes to child care, they are now putting to the Australian people and to the government that instead of in fact prioritising low- and middle-income earners—as we are doing—we should be giving higher rates of subsidy to higher income earners. This is a government that has a proud record of delivering for families, a proud record of keeping childcare rates as low as it possibly can, as opposed to the Labor Party's policy which saw the out-of-pocket costs of child care up 53 per cent during their term in government. Their policies have been proven to fail, and that is why you have this existential crisis within the Labor Party where you get the wiser heads like Joel Fitzgibbon saying to the Labor Party: 'You need to remember who you are. We need to actually put the "labour" back into the Labor Party.' Our childcare package supports low-income earners and middle-income earners. It supports families who are doing it toughest. It supports them in making the choices that they want to make to get on and look after their families.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KITCHING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  In the other place, the Prime Minister rose in the past hour and said, 'Our plan is to get workers who are not in jobs back in jobs,' but there was no detail whatsoever. What I would say is that it is the Labor Party that has actually thought through how to people get into jobs. One instance of that is our proper plan for child care, acknowledging the proper place of female workforce participation, and in turn a proper plan for the economy. The government has shown great unwillingness to support working Australian families by providing a fair and properly funded childcare scheme. The coronavirus pandemic and the economic destruction it has wrought have left us with a once-in-a-generation chance to build the economy that we want, that Australians deserve. Policymakers learnt this lesson during the Great Depression: you do not cut spending during a crisis. Now is the time for a bold plan to restructure the economy, yet what do we hear from the current government? Nothing like that whatsoever; it is all just announcements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government would rather withdraw support early for struggling Australians. They would rather ascribe debt unlawfully to Australians under the robodebt scheme than put money into brave policies and nation-building legacy projects. Fixing the unfair childcare system in this country would be just that. Australians pay some of the highest childcare costs in the world. Fees have increased 35 per cent under the Liberals. That is simply not sustainable. It is only under a Labor government that it will be remedied. Our plan, which the Morrison government refuses to support, will scrap the $10,560 childcare subsidy cap. This cap often sees women losing money just because they undertake an extra day of work. That is just not acceptable. Don't those opposite want to reward ambition, hard work and aspiration? That's what they say, but again it's all just words. Labor will lift the maximum childcare subsidy rate to 90 per cent. Not only will our plan help more women get back into the workforce; it will also help families with the increased living costs that the Morrison government has overseen in this term of government. It will provide for better early childhood learning opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The way the Morrison government have designed their system, women actually lose money should they wish to return to the workforce and work more than three days a week. The current system locks out more than 100,000 families who simply can't afford it. Our plan is good for the economy, and if the Morrison government were serious about being good economic managers, as they so often say they are, they would support it. Our plan will both lift workforce participation and spur economic growth. Both KPMG and the Grattan Institute have modelled the economic benefits of increased investment in child care. KPMG noted that further investment in this sector could create up to 210,000 more working days a week. That is the equivalent of 30,000 to 40,000 full-time jobs. Now, if those opposite don't like KPMG, the Grattan Institute found that women would increase their hours by up to 13 per cent if the childcare system were reformed to make it cheaper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, the Morrison government is squibbing its response to the coronavirus induced economic crisis. It isn't building a plan to create jobs; it isn't investing in critical infrastructure; it isn't easing the burden on families that this awful year has inflicted. Rather than put in place a proper plan for child care in this country, the Morrison government—particularly the bungling former flatmate, the Minister for Government Services—would rather hound people with robodebt notices, all the while knowing that that was unlawful. It is perhaps the most cruel act committed by an Australian government against its citizens that has ever been seen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economy was already in trouble before last summer's bushfires and coronavirus, because of seven, going on eight, years of inaction by the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. Government debt will soon reach $1 trillion. The Morrison government has been relying on outside forces to keep the economy ticking over, at every turn unwilling to intervene to protect the livelihoods of working Australians. Many Australians haven't had a pay rise in real terms for years. Business investment has been weak for years. But now, when faced with the opportunity to support a policy that would not only alleviate the financial stress felt by working mothers and families— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

At 61.2 per cent, women were participating in the workforce more than they ever had. You know as well as I do that, despite the fact that those opposite love to pretend that they are the party of working people and they are the party of women, the cost of child care—childcare fees—went up by 53 per cent in the last term of Labor in government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we're not going to stand here and be lectured to by those opposite about how they're the party of affordable child care. The very fact that senators stand up in this chamber and pretend that child care is a women-only issue is itself disturbing. We on this side know that caring for children is a responsibility that belongs to both parents. It's not something that lies simply on women. It belongs to the entire family. But you'd never know that from what's said by those opposite. You'd think that it only matters to a woman whether or not children are cared for. You know, we operate in the real world.

                  </a>  I can't speak for you, Senator Watt. You can speak for the legalisation of dope, but you can't speak on this issue, because in your party child care is treated like something only women can talk about. Over here we know it's a whole-of-family issue. That's why those opposite will only ever talk about child care in the sense of institutional care in a childcare centre. You'll never hear them talking about income splitting and how that might help the whole family. You never hear them talk about the possibility of tax deductibility of in-home care. You'll never hear them talking about sharing the burden of raising children across the whole family with income splitting. No, it's all about the institutional solution. It's a closed-minded approach. It denies the reality of how many people choose to live their lives and it denies the fact that there is an uncomfortable truth in Labor's childcare policy, a very, very uncomfortable truth. That is that Labor's childcare policy is one that would tax middle-income families to subsidise the child care of the very, very wealthy. If you don't believe me, let me give you the maths. A family in Townsville earning $80,000 a year as a family under the policy of Mr Albanese and those opposite—Labor's signature position from their budget reply—would be subsidising a Sydney family earning $360,000 a year. They would subsidise those on $360,000 a year with the money of the Townsville family earning 80K. Where I'm from that doesn't make much sense. To make it even worse, they want to bake in permanent spending of $6 billion over four years with no plan to pay it, as well as baking in a subsidy for childcare workers to the tune of $10 billion a decade, again with no plan to pay it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we won't take lectures from those opposite. We know the care of children is a whole-of-family issue. We are prepared to approach it that way. We've put record funding into child care—$9.2 billion, growing to over $10 billion in the coming years. We put forward the very first <span style="font-style:italic;">Women's economic security statement</span> and we renewed it. We came into this COVID crisis with record women's workforce participation. That is an approach to women's working success and the success of caring for children and families that we can be proud of and that should be an embarrassment to those opposite as they plan to take from middle-income earners to subsidise those on the Sydney harbourside. Well, good luck to them! We know which Australians we're fighting for.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  When the government was asked about its plans for making child care affordable, Senator Birmingham told us, 'The government takes child care seriously.' It's difficult to this take government seriously when it comes to early childhood education, it's difficult to take this government seriously when it comes to anything that affects working women, and it's difficult to take this government seriously when it comes to addressing household budgets and real household struggles. Working families with children in child care today are struggling right now, and this government has delivered them no relief. In fact, under this government, childcare fees have increased by more than 35 per cent. That's happened at exactly the same time as wages have flatlined, with wage growth at record historical low levels under this seven-year Morrison government. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families can do the maths; they know exactly how expensive and difficult the childcare system is to navigate under this government. They know that many parents actually lose money if they choose to work an extra day or work more than three days a week. That's why Labor will reduce the cost of child care. That's why the Morrison government should commit to our plan, our proposal, to do exactly that. We will scrap the cap, which often sees parents losing money from an extra day's work. We will keep working to fix Australia's broken childcare system. We will take the pressure off family budgets with this reform. We will give families the support that they need to succeed in their lives and in their household budgets—support that this government just refuses to deliver. We know that cheaper child care is not just good for families and household budgets; it's good for the economy as well. It's good for the recovery. Failing to reform child care is just another failure of the Morrison government to get our economy moving. We know that making child care more affordable will lift workforce participation and that that, in turn, will increase growth. We on the Labor side know that cheaper child care is fundamental reform that will absolutely supercharge our recovery.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has repeatedly lacked the vision and the heart to power this recovery for all Australians. This government has repeatedly lacked the vision and the heart to power this recovery for Australian women, in particular. First of all, they left too many women out of the JobKeeper program. Women who were, in fact, hardest hit by this COVID crisis got the least support from the Morrison government: casuals, hospitality workers, arts and events sector workers and university workers. Then, after leaving all of those women workers behind, they removed JobKeeper early for early childhood educators. This government chose to target early childhood educators in this pandemic—the very people who were going to work every day to educate our children while everybody else was being asked to stay home to stay safe. This is a sector that is made up of 95 per cent women. Now they're leaving women out of the recovery. Women have lost more jobs than men in this crisis. There are more women unemployed in Australia than ever before. But the government took no steps to get women back to work in its budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, the government spent one-third of one per cent on women's economic security in their budget. They delivered nothing for jobs in sectors dominated by women workers, such as aged care, early childhood education, the arts, hospitality and higher education. Those sectors dominated by women got either nothing or next to nothing, or, indeed, got funding cuts, from this government. Women's jobs just do not matter to this government. When the government was called out on this, we got its now famous response: 'What you can find in the budget for women is our package on road infrastructure, because women drive on roads. That's what women get in this budget: roads.' The government just fails to understand that supporting jobs in sectors women work in supports not just 50 per cent of our population; it supports the economy as a whole. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business (Senator Cash) to a question without notice asked by Senator Siewert today relating to climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to take note of Minister Cash's response, representing the Minister for Health, to my question about climate change and a health emergency. Quite plainly, the government doesn't think that climate change presents a health emergency. She refused to answer that question. She articulated a few of the initiatives the government's taking, but it's curious that those did not include ensuring that climate change is part of our long-term national priority health plan. Is it in that? No, it's not, so clearly it's not a priority for this government—well, let's face it: climate change is not a priority for this government—but it's certainly not a priority in terms of looking at the impact it is having on people's health in this country or at what sort of systems response we need to properly address the impact of climate change on our health system and on people's health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear: climate change is a health emergency. It requires urgent action by government. Literally, people's lives are at stake. If we do not address climate change as a health emergency, people's lives will be lost. We know that. Climate change is already having an impact on people's health and people's lives. As I articulated when I asked the question, 450 people last year died or had their lives affected through direct impacts or through air pollution, and thousands of others have had their lives impacted through the pollution and the damage caused by climate change already.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to point out that First Nations people will be particularly affected by climate change as a health emergency. They already have poorer outcomes in their health. We already know the gap in life expectancy isn't being closed. We know that First Nations people are living in overcrowded housing. We already know that many have less funding and resources available to respond to the climate emergency as it affects their health. Many live in rural and remote areas and, in fact, are already feeling the impacts of climate change on their health: they are already being required, for example, to move in response to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just recently we've had three important reports released that are addressing these issues. Just today we had the Grattan Institute's report <span style="font-style:italic;">Climate change and health: preparing for the next disaster</span>, where they make seven recommendations and clearly point out that we can't regard the issue of climate change in terms of health as an optional extra; it has to be core business. Yet we know it's not included in the National Preventive Health Strategy, for example. You would have thought it would be one of those key areas that government would think should be there. It's not included in Australia's Long Term National Health Plan, and research is not being funded at a high enough level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got <span style="font-style:italic;">The 2020 special report of the MJA</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: lessons learnt from Australia's "Black Summer"</span>. This report looks at the health of the Australian public and sees it as uniquely at risk from the effects of climate change. It demonstrates the need for the federal government to adopt a national strategy on climate change in relation to health and wellbeing. The report is clearly a call to action and also articulates the fact that many of our health experts are saying climate change is a health emergency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the Centre for Future Work report on climate change producing dangerous heat stress in workplaces. This report articulates the impacts of climate change on people's health in the workplace. It says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">
                  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Heat stress poses serious health and safety risks for many workers across Australia</span>, and Australia must act on the causes of rising temperatures and changing weather patterns. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we have, just recently, really clear evidence that the climate crisis is a health emergency, but the government once again are missing in action when it comes to addressing climate change and, of course, they're refusing to accelerate our move to net zero emissions. Quite clearly we need this government to commit to net zero emissions by, at latest, 2035. We are failing to take this issue seriously, and it will directly lead to lives being lost. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The current Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) system for funding residential aged care providers has been criticised by the independent Aged Care Financing Authority as unstable, inefficient and not supporting deliver of quality care. The Aged Care Royal Commission has, in its propositions on funding, suggested a case-mix classification model for residential aged care with independent assessment.

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is one of the few remaining democracies that can legally deploy its defence forces into conflict zones without recourse to the Parliament: the decision is reserved for the executive alone. As kindred democracies around the world have enacted reforms to vest the so-called 'War Power' in elected Parliaments, Australia has remained anchored to a pre-democratic tradition founded in hereditary monarchies and feudal states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If this anachronism had served Australia well, it might be possible to mount an argument that "if it isn't broken, it doesn't need fixing."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the release of the Afghan Inquiry report and the full realisation of the extent of the shameful alleged crimes carried out by Australian Special Forces does not comprehensively put this view to rest, it is difficult to imagine what would. On the basis of fabricated and willfully misinterpreted intelligence, Prime Minister John Howard followed the United States and the United Kingdom into an illegal and open-ended war in Iraq. Our Parliament, and by extension the voting public of Australia, were cut out of the decision, despite the fact that hundreds of millions of people around the world organised and campaigned against the decision to go to war.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are few credible analysts left anywhere who do not regard the decision by hardliners within the Bush Administration to invade Iraq as one of the most grievous strategic disasters in modern history. The vast majority of Australians were right, and the executive authorities in the US, the UK and Australia, were wrong. No inquiry into the decision to go to war has ever been held in Australia, only a handful of piecemeal attempts to pin the blame on intelligence services and shift focus away from the actions of the Howard Government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the time, Iraq was not threatening war. There was no connection or allegiance between the secular Baathist regime that ruled Iraq and the fundamentalist Al Qaeda networks responsible for the 9/11 attacks. There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and hadn't been since 1991. Intelligence agencies within the US, the UK and Australia understood these facts, but inflexible groupthink prevailed within the White House, Downing Street and the Prime Minister's office here in Australia. It was rumoured at the time that Australian Special Forces units were among the very first on the ground inside Iraq, even before President Bush went on live television to announce that Operation Iraqi Freedom had commenced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is entirely complicit in the violent, decade-long occupation that shattered Iraq's social and economic structures, and ignited long-dormant sectarian tensions that ultimately contributed to the establishment of the caliphate over Northern Iraq and Syria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If there is a strategic policy failure more complete than the catastrophic invasion of Iraq, it is difficult to recall it. This dismal outcome was predicted at the time by many of those who opposed the war, but the executive's lock on the process means that the normal Parliamentary processes of critique and accountability were bypassed. Somewhere between 100,000 and one million Iraqis have paid for this obscene oversight with their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Concurrently with the Iraq deployment, Australia fought a long, costly, and ultimately futile war in Afghanistan. The heaviest cost was carried by the Afghan people: tens of thousands of civilians killed, maimed and traumatised as the US Government's saturation bombing campaign transitioned into a long, untenable occupation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What we now know, with the release of the Brereton report, is that in lieu of an overarching strategic objective Australian Special Forces soldiers did not act lawfully or respectfully towards the Afghan people. In his report, Justice Paul Brereton has concluded that 36 separate incidents, involving 25 special forces soldiers, resulted in the murder of 39 Afghan civilians, including children, and the torture of two others. This is a national shame.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Justice Brereton also found that commanding officers either turned a blind eye to sanitised reporting, failing to ask the right questions about high kill counts and questionable evidence, or were so disengaged from the troops on the ground that they simply did not know what was going on. Both of these scenarios are a failure not just of the individual perpetrators to do the right thing, or the commanding officers who were supposed to be in charge, but a political failure as well. Multiple Australian governments are ultimately responsible for sending Australian troops overseas to fight in a seemingly endless conflict with limited overarching strategic objectives, and for keeping them there for well over a decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The erratic and secretive nature of military deployment decisions in Afghanistan should seal this argument once and for all: no leader, no matter how perfect, can be trusted alone to make decisions such as this on behalf of the whole nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is no longer tenable that the decision to deploy into conflict zones should be left to the executive alone. Currently, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence Act 1903</span> does not allow for any level of transparent decision making, scrutiny and debate, but this is an artefact of legislation, not the natural order of things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2020 inserts a new section 29A into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence Act 1903</span> to require that decisions to deploy members of the Australian Defence Force beyond the territorial limits be made not by the executive alone but by Parliament as a whole. This means debate in both houses, followed by a vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill was initiated by the Australian Democrats and supported by the Australian Greens, who took carriage of the Bill after 2007. It is the latest iteration of a Bill first introduced into the Senate in 1985. This year it will mark its 35th year of languishing in plain sight while Liberal and Labor Prime Ministers alike reserve this power to themselves, plunging Australia into a tragic series of overseas expeditionary wars that have had little or nothing to do with the defence of Australia or collective security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In August 2009, the Senate referred the Bill to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. The majority of the committee resolved to refuse to take evidence in a hearing. Nonetheless, the committee made a useful critique of the Bill without undermining its essential purpose, in its report of February 2010.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens' dissenting report into the Bill provided the transcript of an informal hearing that we held, after the majority committee's short-sighted decision not to take evidence directly from witnesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill would bring Australia into conformity with principles and practices utilised in other democracies including Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, where troop deployment is set down in constitutional or legislative provisions. Some form of parliamentary approval or consultation is also routinely undertaken in Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway. Our ally the United States has a similar provision that subjects the decision to go to war to a broader forum—section 8 of Article I of the US Constitution quite clearly says, "Congress shall have power to declare war". In the wake of the disaster in Iraq, the Westminster Parliament now holds the de-facto war power, a new convention that prevented a rushed deployment into Syria in 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Arguments against vesting the power over troop deployment to Parliament include that it would be impractical, restrictive and inefficient. Such arguments ignore the fact that parliaments can and do make complex and nuanced decisions, rapidly when necessary. As we have seen, decisions about war and peace made in undue haste that do not enjoy the mandate of the population - expressed through the Parliament, if nowhere else - have no legitimacy.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know that the Australian community supports, strongly, the idea of making sure that the people they elect to represent them are accountable for making the decision to send our troops overseas to risk their lives in armed conflict. A Roy Morgan opinion poll carried out in September of this year found that 83.3% of Australians want Parliament to decide whether our troops are sent into armed conflict abroad. The poll found that support for reform is very strong across the political spectrum with more than 75% of all Labor, Coalition and Greens voters believing that Parliamentary approval should be required before Australian troops are deployed. There is no excuse; in response to the shameful and disgusting revelations from the Brereton Inquiry the major parties must support a democratic process to war.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are appropriate exemptions made in this Bill to avoid interfering with the non-warlike overseas service with which Australian troops are engaged - referring in particular to new subsection 29A(11). There are also appropriate exemptions in the Bill to provide for the practicalities of situations where Parliament cannot immediately meet - referring to subsections 29A(3) and (7), which provide for the Governor-General to be able to make a proclamation regarding the declaration of war, provided that Parliament is then recalled within a period of two days.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is time that Australia joined its closest allies and like-minded democratic states by involving the Parliament in the decision to deploy the ADF. The entwined tragedies of our recent military misadventures, and the threat that history may soon repeat, make passage of this Bill more urgent than ever. War is never the answer but if there is ever a time that the government of the day decides to send our troops overseas to war then we - the Australian Parliament and, by extension, the Australian people - should get a say.</span>

                  </a>  Real wages growth under the Morrison government of 0.07 per cent is in line with the 20-year average and is the same as the average under Labor's last term in government. The fact is that wages are forecast to grow by 1¾ of a per cent through the year to the June quarter 2021 and 1½ per cent to the June quarter 2022. The key to lifting real wages is lifting productivity growth, and that's why we've focused on lowering taxes, investing in infrastructure, equipping our workers with better skills and improving our industrial relations framework.</span>

                  </a>  The government agrees that all Australians have a right to enjoy equal rights and be treated with equal respect, regardless of race, colour, creed or origin. Australia is a strong and robust liberal democracy with one of the world's most open and thriving multicultural societies. Australia owes its strength and prosperity in no small part to the economic and social contributions of successive generations of migrants coming to our shores. The Australian government proudly acknowledges Chinese Australians' strong cultural, social and economic contributions to Australian life. Our nation has greatly benefited from the contribution made by people of Chinese heritage, many of whom have distinguished themselves in all walks of life including business, medicine, education and, indeed, politics.</span>

                  </a>  The Greens support this motion. What Senator Abetz did was disgraceful. There is no doubt about that. Interrogating a person's loyalty to this country because of their cultural background is unacceptable. It's just as disgraceful that Senator Abetz has dug his heels in and refuses to engage in self-reflection. It's even more disgraceful that not one single minister of this government has condemned Senator Abetz for his racist targeting of Chinese Australians. The government should not be tolerating any insinuation that Chinese Australian communities are suspect or have questionable allegiances. This is horrid, toxic stuff. I was proud to put my name to an Asian Australian Alliance open letter calling on Minister Tudge to make clear that Senator Abetz's behaviour was unacceptable. I reiterate my call today.</span>

That should be withdrawn under any interpretation of the standing orders. Secondly, the motion asserts that I demanded certain things. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> shows no demand was made. Thirdly, I can indicate that no request for loyalty was made, yet that is once again repeated in the motion. Because they have no feathers to fly with, the two Labor Party operatives who gave evidence to a Senate committee found difficulty in answering a simple, basic question as to whether a country, a dictatorship, that has one million of its citizens in a concentration camp ought be condemned. They have this immediate reaction that to do so is racist. I stand with the oppressed.</span>

                  </a>  The coalition government supports the development of our offshore gas resources. New gas supplies will drive down gas and electricity prices for Australian businesses, provide an essential feedstock and energy source for Australian manufacturers and provide heating and cooking for millions of households. Australia's competitive advantage has always been based on cheap energy, and gas will be central to our ongoing economic recovery. Exploration for and production of gas in Commonwealth offshore waters has been undertaken safely and responsibly for decades. The Australian government makes its decisions in the interests of all Australians while the Greens show their contempt for the Australian industry and Australian workers who rely on a reliable east coast gas supply.</span>

The findings of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Afghanistan inquiry report</span> of the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force that credible information exists in relation to some members of Australian special forces having engaged in unlawful killings and cruel treatment while deployed in Afghanistan are appalling.

                  </a>  The Morrison-McCormack government is committed to the Basin Plan. The Basin Plan implementation is a shared responsibility between basin governments. On 4 September this year, Minister Pitt announced the $270 million Murray-Darling Communities Investment Package, which brings basin communities back to the heart of the Basin Plan. We've considered the reports and listened to communities. We're moving towards off-farm efficiencies and have ruled out any further buybacks. We're delivering outcomes for regional basin communities and the environment. Stunts like this one from Labor do nothing to deliver for communities or for the environment.</span>

I point to paragraph (c) in particular, which talks about the problems, as the National Party describe them, with the 450 gigalitres. I want to make it very clear that any South Australian senator who votes for this will need to go back to Adelaide and explain why they've just sold out our state. Whether it's Senator Birmingham, Senator Fawcett or any other Liberal coalition member who votes for this—prepare to see the wrath of the South Australians when you've sold us down the river.</span>

                  </a>  The department of agriculture has already acquired 2,075 gigalitres for the environment, leaving just 450 gigalitres to come from efficiency savings. Connected basin farmers do not have 450 gigalitres to give up and they do not need to. For thousands of years, the high-rainfall area known as the south-east sent a long-term average of 450 gigalitres of freshwater into the Coorong and Lower Lakes. Between 1864 and 2011, the South Australian government built a network of drains to take that water out into the great Southern Ocean, where it is destroying native seagrasses. This motion is demanding that water to fix the Coorong and Lower Lakes still come from other states, including Queensland. One Nation has a better idea. Turn the drains back around and use South Australia's own water to solve the many environmental issues affecting the Coorong and Lower Lakes. These are problems South Australia created for itself, and they have a simple solution.</span>

The plan involves a number of stakeholders—including the environment, pastoralists, irrigators, tourism operators and recreational users—and it has been laid out and agreed amongst all of the states. When it gets tough for the irrigators, they quickly say: 'Let's change the plan. Let's not deliver the plan. Let's do something different.' It's quite disingenuous, and it's quite disrespectful to the fact that the plan has been agreed by all and involves compromise by all.

This is against a backdrop where we know that spending on defence infrastructure projects is one of the worst ways to spend public funds. Bang for buck, it delivers fewer jobs, it helps fewer people and it does more damage to our environment than nearly any other way of spending public funds, and, as Senator Siewert so often tells me and any other person who will listen, it is a terrible thing in this country that, when people don't have enough to eat, we plunge billions into war machines.</span>

                  </a>  The Australian social security system is a non-contributory, residence based program designed primarily to support Australian citizens and permanent residents. There has always been an expectation that temporary visa holders are able to support themselves while in Australia. Temporary visa holders who are unable to support themselves under these arrangements are strongly encouraged to return home. Most temporary visa holders with work rights were given access to their superannuation until 1 July 2020 to help support themselves. The government has provided $13 million to the Australian Red Cross to deliver emergency relief support, which is helping more than 50,000 temporary migrants. Those on temporary visas who are experiencing domestic and family violence are able to access existing national services that received extra Commonwealth funding, including 1800RESPECT, specialised family violence services and the trafficked people program.</span>

                  </a>  The opposition will be supporting section (a) of this motion, but in relation to section (b) we can't, and I would ask that the question be put on the parts separately. This is a point I've raised a number of times in this place. This part of the program is meant to be for straightforward and non-controversial items that don't require debate. In a party of government, when there is a section which calls for change that involves a considerable amount of money, we go through our own processes. It won't be determined by a Greens motion in this place, and it is not the appropriate place to do that. This is something where debate should be allowed and where there is discussion. It is not a yes or no question. In the interest of getting through this part of the program, we'll just ask that those questions be put separately.</span>

The minister for veterans affairs runs a $12 billion department that can find the time, surely, to reach out to the Australian military witnesses, those military members accused and their families. I'd also like to express my deepest respect and sympathy to all those who have served in 2 Squadron SASR since 1964, including our Borneo and Vietnam veterans, those who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq and those who are on other missions that we will never know about, and to the thousands of family members attached to these men who are now feeling shame, heartache and repercussions because of the alleged actions of a few. I want to make sure it is fully acknowledged by all sides of the parliament that they too are suffering.</span>

If, by some miracle or by the dodgy accounting tricks that I'll talk about in a minute, we meet those targets Australia will still be the highest per capita emitter on the planet. These targets are pathetic. They are not strong enough. They are not based on science. They are written by the fossil fuel industry that donates to this government and to the opposition. They are writing the death warrant for the Great Barrier Reef, for our agriculture sector and for so many lives and for so much human misery as natural disasters just increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Kingdom recently recommended that their targets be increased by 68 per cent. Their government actually listened to their scientific advisers and increased its 2030 target by that amount. When Prime Minister Boris Johnson is making more sense than your own Prime Minister, you know you're in trouble; it's the one thing on which we'd like Prime Minister Scott Morrison to listen to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. But, as I mentioned, our two big political parties are completely in the pockets of the oil, coal and gas political donors, who also offer them very well-paid lobbyist jobs once they leave parliament. And I think all of Australia knows that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bureau of Meteorology has some very sobering news. It says Australia is not on track to keep global warming to the two degrees that we signed up to as a citizen of this world; in fact, we're on track for 4.4 degrees of warming over our landmass. That's goodbye to the reef, that's goodbye to most of our productive agriculture and that's hello to an awful lot of devastation that is an entirely unnecessary, because we have the skills, the nous and the resources to transition to 100 per cent clean energy as soon as possible. But we're not seeing any of that from this government. On the reef, we just had the final warning bell sounded by the IUCN, with their three yearly World Heritage Outlook, which was released last week, now saying that the Great Barrier Reef is 'critical'. It is the strongest listing that can be given to a World Heritage site, but it's not surprising because we've lost 50 per cent of the coral cover of the Great Barrier Reef in five years with three severe bleaching episodes. We're meant to be heading into a La Nina, but there's concern that there will be yet another bleaching. This is the last warning that this government is going to get before UNESCO decides whether or not to list the reef as World Heritage in Danger. That would be factually accurate, but it would decimate the tourism industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need the government to do is to adopt strong 2030 emissions reductions targets. This is the critical decade, but today they want a pat on the back because they've said they're not going to cheat on their homework. They've said they're not going to use the Kyoto carryover credits and they expect some kind of praise, when it was five years ago that most other nations voluntarily said they wouldn't use their carryover credits and when Australia was in fact the only nation that in that initial climate agreement in Kyoto was allowed to increase its pollution. The only reason we have carryover credits is that we were allowed to pollute even more, when all of the rest of the world decided to tighten their belt. So I'm sorry but we're not going to praise the Prime Minister for saying that he won't use dodgy accounting to somehow meet our targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other dodgy accounting point is that they're now trying to claim that they're on track to meet our targets, because again we're relying on a provision about land use that no other country is relying on. If you take out that dodgy accounting, Australia is in fact polluting more than we were in 2005, which is meant to be the baseline year that we're meant to be 26 to 28 per cent better than by the end of this decade. We are not on a good trajectory. This is a critical decade, and we need the government and the opposition to stop taking the dirty money from coal, oil and gas and start listening to the science bodies. Stop defunding the science bodies and actually adopt some climate targets that we can amply meet, that will generate more jobs, that will protect our reef and our way of life and that will set us up for future economic prosperity. Stop putting your own personal interests ahead of the nation's.</span>

But there was no comparison with any other country, so I for one at first thought maybe we'd gone back into some twilight zone where we were once again a colony of the United Kingdom and we were being told what to do by, according to Senator Waters, our colonial masters in London. Yes, our colonial masters in London would love us to cripple our own industry so they can continue to compete with us. They'd love us to impose huge costs on our own country in a way that many other nations are not doing. But I for one am proud of and cherish the independence that this nation has achieved since we threw off the colonial chains and became an independent country. So, no, I don't think we should slavishly follow what Mr Johnson in London wants us to do. Good luck to him. He's the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and he can decide what the policies are for the United Kingdom. </span>

                  </a>  Well, Senator Waters, start acting like one. Don't just adopt the policies of another country. A proud republican would actually want to cherish our independence and chart our course through the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to come to the other countries as well. Senator Waters only mentioned the United Kingdom, but when you look around the world you see that New Zealand, our cousins and good friends, are not meeting their Kyoto targets. The Kyoto targets come due this year, 2020, so New Zealand has about three weeks to meet its Kyoto targets that it is failing to meet right now. It has only reduced emissions by just under three per cent when it promised to reduce them by five per cent. As much as Jacinda Ardern wants to go around the world spruiking that she is committed to net zero emissions by 2050, the fact remains that her country has not met the commitments it made just 10 or 15 years ago, so how can it be trusted to do something in 30 years time? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, Canada has barely changed its emissions. It is not meeting its Kyoto targets. Japan is not meeting its Kyoto targets. Almost every other country in the world is not meeting its targets. Then of course countries like China and India don't even have any real targets to meet under Kyoto, or Paris for that matter. But we are. Senator Waters thinks it's through dodgy accounting, which I'll come to. We are one of the few countries that are actually meeting their targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other main problem I have with the implication in this motion that we should follow the United Kingdom and reduce our emissions in the order of 68 per cent by 2030 is that that will actually do nothing for the environment unless we consume less stuff. I didn't hear from the Greens—and we never hear this from the Greens—that we should not buy as many solar panels, wind turbines and electric cars from overseas. All of these things are made using coal and often in countries with much worse environmental records than we have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time we put up a wind turbine it takes about 900 tonnes of steel. It takes around 800 tonnes of coking coal to make one tonne of steel. If you times 800 by 900, you see that there is a lot of coking coal embodied in those turbines. Every time you build a wind turbine there are 2,500 tonnes of concrete. Making concrete typically uses a lot of coal too in heating the lime in the kilns. That also has a huge carbon emissions impact. Again, we don't hear from the Greens in this chamber about the need for fewer wind turbines. Of course Bob Brown and Christine Milne are doing great work opposing wind turbines in Tasmania, and all power to them. This mob in here are cheering on the extra carbon emissions we would get from wind turbines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost all of our solar panels are imported from China. Where does China get the energy to power its factories to produce these cheap solar panels? Coal—and a lot of it used to be our coal. They use coal to produce cheap solar panels that we then happily import. I say to the renewable energy industry, 'If we really want to save the planet, let's make the solar panels here.' I'd support that. I'm not against solar panels and renewable energy, but let's make them here rather than make them in dirty factories in China. Why don't we make the solar panels here? Why do we allow these companies to take government subsidies all the time and then import solar panels from other countries where the jobs are created? Let's make them here in this country in at least a cleaner fashion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, if we were to reduce our emissions by 60 or 70 per cent, even if we were to reduce them by 100 per cent—if we were to get rid of our carbon emissions tomorrow—in the words of Dr Alan Finkel, that would do 'virtually nothing' for the environment, because Australia only accounts for roughly 1.3 per cent of the world's emissions. So, even if Australia were to get rid of all of its carbon emissions tomorrow, it would not make a single difference to the world; it would not change the temperature. That was confirmed by our Chief Scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, when a good mate of mine, former Senator Ian Macdonald, asked Dr Alan Finkel at Senate estimates what the impact would be of reducing the world's emissions by 1.3 per cent. Dr Alan Finkel replied, 'Virtually nothing.' And he's absolutely right; it would do virtually nothing for the planet. But apparently we want to push on and continue down this path where we self-flagellate for no actual environmental outcome; we cost jobs in this country but don't help the environment at all. The latest absurdity here is this push to give up our Kyoto credits and give up the fact that we've overachieved on carbon emissions. We have to do that, yet there is never a call from the Greens to penalise those countries who have underachieved. Why is all the criticism of our country? Why isn't there any criticism of other countries? It's because the Greens don't really like Australia. They don't like our country; they don't stand up for it, and they certainly don't want to put Australia first. There's never any criticism of other countries for not meeting their Kyoto commitments.</span>

                  </a>  I've certainly touched a nerve today. The Greens don't put Australia first, because they never criticise other countries. If we are going to have to give up our Kyoto credits, why shouldn't other countries be allocated Kyoto debits? Why shouldn't other countries get Kyoto debits for all the underachievement they have presided over during last 10 or 15 years? That seems pretty logical to me. So, if we are to give up these Kyoto credits, we should make other countries do more in the next period to catch up—New Zealand, Canada, Japan and many other countries around the world.</span>

                  </a>  Yes, the Greens certainly can give it, but they can't take it. Senator Waters was right; we've stopped farmers developing their own land. We've stripped them of their property rights and provided them no compensation. We've told them, 'That little part of your block over there that you bought, that you might have wanted to develop in the future and grow food on—you can't touch that anymore.' We've got this ridiculous situation where that is apparently a carbon credit and that lets us spruik to the world and say how good we are. If we have a surplus of these good intentions or good outcomes, why don't we give them back to farmers? Why are we giving them to the world? Why don't we give those 400 million tonnes back to our nation's farmers so that they can grow more food? That seems like a good idea. If we have locked up too much land— </span>

If we have somehow got this surplus of credits, let's give our farmers a break. They've been doing it pretty tough over the last couple of decades with drought, in some cases suffering from floods and, on top of that, having their property rights stripped away from them. Let's give them some of those rights back so they can do something for our nation that we should all be proud of—that is, grow high-quality food that we all enjoy. Some of it will be exported, but we benefit from it too. Let's give our farmers a break, put our country first and reject this silly motion.</span>

It's really frustrating that we're here again today, debating this urgency motion, without a pathway forward for how we as a country and as a parliament are going to deal with the very urgent case of combating climate change. We had this debate this time last year, a decade after opposition to the CPRS triggered what has become known colloquially as the climate wars in this country, and still there isn't a pathway forward. Still people come into this chamber and bicker and point and say, 'We're going to be better than you guys,' and, 'You're not doing enough.' I think the people of Australia deserve more leadership from politicians in this place. Communities are worried about what's happening to our climate. People are worried about what it means for their jobs. Our kids are worried about what it means for their future. And yet here we are, 11 years on, having pretty much the same discussion. That's the depressing nature of this. </span>

                  </a>  Look where we are now. It's very easy for parties in this place to project the blame onto others rather than look at what role they have played, and no-one has been perfect. But the answer to how we're going to deal with climate change and the impact of a warming planet on people's lives—what it means for people's health, for their jobs and for the way they conduct their lives—is only going to happen when we all come together, realise the magnitude of the problem and work together, despite our differences, to map out a pathway forward. That isn't the approach the Greens political party have taken in this place. When they were given the opportunity to work with the more progressive side of politics, they chose another way out, only to then change two years later and vote for a scheme that wasn't as good. That's what they did. Here we are, 11 years on, and we haven't made any progress. We've got a government that should be held to account that has been woefully inadequate in the way that it has dealt with climate change. We've had a decade—</span>

                  </a>  The Paris commitment from Mr Abbott and the Prime Minister is for a 26 per cent emissions cut by 2030, and the government are nowhere near being on track to meet that. Their own projections show that, on current policy settings, we'll reduce our emissions by only four per cent over the course of the decade. We are becoming increasingly isolated on the world stage, with over 70 per cent of our trading partners committing to net zero emissions by the middle of the century. We've had all the peak groups—whether they be the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Industry Group or the Business Council—all of the peak community organisations and the ACTU commit to net zero emissions by 2050, but we haven't had that commitment from our government. Part of the reason we haven't is that people remain so divided on the right thing to do, and that problem is partly because those on our side continue to bicker. Why wouldn't those who believe in climate change and want to see greater action on it come together and work out what we're after, instead of coming in here and trying to blame each other? The Greens point at us and tell us how it's all Labor's fault. There is no commitment to working together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at what happened in the ACT when those on the progressive side of politics worked together. The ACT is powered by 100 per cent renewable energy. Why is that? Because the progressive side of politics put aside their differences and worked out a way to deliver a good public policy outcome. I know, because I sat in that room, that it wasn't because the Greens political party forced our hand but because we both wanted the right outcome for our community.</span>

What they are interested in is getting their social media video out, pointing the finger at the major parties and making themselves out as those who are without fault. The minute someone draws attention to their tactics and the way they're operating, and the fact that we are going nowhere with placing pressure on this government about its woeful record on climate change—this is part of the problem. You didn't come in here seeking to resolve it. You don't seek to compromise, you don't seek to collaborate, you don't seek to—</span>

But what is not explained there is that you're not measuring like with like in terms of current debate in Australia about mid-2030 emissions reduction targets, because the UK target is based on 1990 levels. Because of that, this motion is misleading, and the opposition won't be supporting it. However, if you had been factually correct, if you hadn't been seeking to mislead—</span>

I look forward to the day—given that the Greens and the Labor Party have a shared view that stronger action needs to be taken on climate change and that we should be asking and requiring more of the Morrison government when it comes to action on climate change—when they come to us with a motion that is factually correct and when they collaborate and cooperate with us so that we are in a position to support it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  I'm r<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">e</span>minded of when grandma and grandpa dropped the kids off after they'd filled them with sugar. I think what they've done today is drive the kids to the Senate chamber!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of this debate, and noting that I come to this place from an engineering background, I'm almost a little bit amused at the way there's this arbitrary declaration of what the emission target ought to be, as if we're able to sit here and make a statement that it should be this amount by this time and then someone else wants to kick the ball a bit further or have some other tactic. What we really need to do is understand that what we're trying to do is have energy that is clean, reliable and affordable. That's what I think everyone is trying to achieve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of just throwing out targets of one sort and then having someone else come back with a different target and then, a few months later, having a different target called for, we should actually approach this in an engineering manner. We should actually be developing a long-term national strategy for emissions reduction. Whilst it's okay to go into such an endeavour with some sort of requirement in mind, we actually need to work through and determine how that might be achieved and, in the execution of that plan, what the cost is, what the outcome is and all the things that are necessary to achieve a particular aim—and, indeed, whether the aim is, in actual fact, possible. That's the process that we should be taking, and it doesn't seem to happen here. We just have politicians standing up and saying, 'This is the new number that I want to declare today as the answer.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to develop a strategy that is mindful of those goals that I talked about and of the need to create job opportunities along the way, to grow the economy, to maximise the benefits and minimise the cost, and to do so in a manner that is without risk. We want to make sure that when we do that it is a national strategy whereby we have the federal government working hand in glove with the state governments and also with local councils. We can't do that if we're playing this emission reduction target football, as we are. I would encourage all to perhaps pick up a book on system engineering and look at how you might approach a complex problem like this. Perhaps the government needs to very seriously look at the national plan that I talked about, a long-term strategy on emission targets, and have it open for everyone to look at and criticise. That's the only way we're going to get a sensible outcome, not by shouting and trying to outcompete each other in this chamber.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  It's great to be in here to speak on this matter of urgency, and I thank Senator McKim for it. It's like a dorothy dixer session for us on this side. No doubt he'll try another one of his tricks through this, which I'll welcome, because then I get to have a drink of water. I've got a bit of a rough dose of hay fever today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison Liberal government takes climate change seriously, and we are serious about delivering real outcomes, because it is outcomes and action that matter, not motions in the Senate and not grand declarations of targets without a plan to achieve them. We on this side of the chamber are ambitious to reduce our emissions but, unlike those opposite, we actually have a plan. Those opposite come into this place, beat their chests and jump up and down calling for greater action, but, when you ask how they would achieve that, what do you hear? You hear crickets. It is clear that those opposite, and especially those at the end of the chamber, are all talk and no action. They are all bluster and tokenism, positioning and politics. We in the Morrison Liberal government are not playing politics on this issue. While those at that end of the chamber are talking the talk, we are getting on with walking the walk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the facts. Climate change is a global issue, and Australia, as part of the global community, is taking action. We are 100 per cent committed to a strong and practical global action in response to climate change. We are 100 per cent committed to the Paris Agreement. It was, after all, a Liberal government that signed the Paris Agreement. It was a Liberal government that adopted a 2030 target. It was a Liberal government that adopted a clear plan to meet and beat our 2030 targets. It was a Liberal government that remained committed to the Kyoto Protocol when others wavered. It was the Liberal government that beat our 2020 target by 459 million tonnes, and it will be a Liberal government that will meet and beat our 2030 target.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why? Because with the Liberal government being in charge we've been able to set ambitious targets and then reach them, all without increases to taxes on everyday Australians and especially small businesses. When in government, those at that end of the chamber and opposite decided the only way to achieve emissions reductions was through the highly hurtful and harsh carbon tax. When Labor left government in 2012, their forecast was that emissions in this year, in 2020, would be 637 million tonnes, and that was with a carbon tax. Last week we learnt that our emissions are 513 million tonnes—20 per cent lower than what those opposite forecast that we would achieve. Guess what else? We got rid of the carbon tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you compare our track record with the track record of those opposite, we've done far better. When you compare our track record with similar economies, we've done far better. Australia's emissions fell faster than the OECD average—faster than Canada, faster than New Zealand, faster than Japan and faster than the United States. Canada is not on track to meet its 2020 target. Canada's emissions are virtually unchanged since 2005. New Zealand expect that they will only achieve their 2020 target with the use of carryover. New Zealand's emissions are down by only one per cent since 2005. As of 2018, well before COVID-19, our emissions were down more than 13 per cent, and the latest data has Australia's emissions down by 16.6 per cent on 2005 levels. For those opposite to come in here and say we're not doing enough shows how little they care about facts, actions or outcomes. This Liberal government is getting on with the job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pathway to meaningful reductions in global emissions is through the development and deployment of new technologies. We're investing in future energy technologies that will support jobs, strengthen our economy, cut energy costs and reduce emissions. We are doing this without compromising the affordable, reliable power that Australians rely on. Our Technology Investment Roadmap is focused on reducing the cost of energy, not raising it. It is about making sure that there are more jobs and more investment, not less. Getting these technologies right will support 130,000 new jobs by 2030, many of those in regional Australia, and they will maintain Australia's position as a world-leading exporter of food, fibre, minerals and energy—all at the same time as reducing our emissions. The widespread global deployment of these technologies could substantially reduce or eliminate emissions in sectors responsible for 90 per cent of the world's emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want customers to choose lower emitting technologies because they make sense for them, for their household or for their business. This is not about a government telling businesses or households what they should do. Instead, it's about making sure that those lower emitting alternatives are there and at as low a cost as possible. This is a policy built on Liberal philosophy, a philosophy that has worked well for Australia for decades. Our plan is to reduce the cost of new technologies, not raise the cost of existing ones. In the budget, we also announced our $1.9 billion investment package to create jobs and bring new technologies into play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while Labor and the Greens come in here, beat their chests and put forward tokenistic motions, the Morrison government is getting on with it. We're dealing with the issues and we're getting great results—reducing emissions, achieving our targets, reducing the cost of electricity for all Australians. We are focusing on delivering on the outcomes that matter, not tokenism, positioning or politics. Australia should be proud of our achievements. We should be proud of the fact that we are a world leader in energy, including renewables. We should be proud of the fact that we are in a very small group of nations that have met all their international targets, and we will have achieved this while supporting our key domestic sectors like mining, agriculture and manufacturing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was interesting, in the report that Senator McKim quotes, that in the UK government's plan they talk about delivering part of their emissions reductions through the use of advanced nuclear power. Perhaps the senators at that end of the chamber could come in here and have a sensible debate about nuclear energy one day, if they're serious about bringing down emissions, as opposed to just propping up their mates who sell solar panels. So we celebrate Australia's—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  Scientists, businesses, parliamentarians and the Australian community have been calling for the government to take action on climate change. But over seven long years they have refused to listen, stubbornly indifferent to the consequences of inaction. Now the Australian government's failures have caught the attention of international leaders, who are calling on Mr Morrison to take action on climate change and to commit to strong emissions targets. Not that long ago five international leaders, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron, wrote a letter to Mr Morrison demanding that Australia make a bold new commitment at the Climate Ambition Summit. It couldn't be a clearer message. The world is looking to Australia for leadership, and this government fails the test.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has already lost 10 years to baseless fear campaigns against climate action. We can't afford to lose another 10 years. When Labor was last in government emissions came down by more than 15 per cent. Under the Liberals and the Nationals we see no such progress. Eleven years ago, almost to the day, the Liberals, the Nationals and the Greens voted down Labor's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Eleven years later, as a direct consequence of that shameful act, Australia is still waiting and is still missing an effective climate change policy that will see a reduction in our emissions.</span>

                  </a>  Indeed, the Greens political party are touchy about this question, because it was a great mistake. It's a mistake for which they have refused to apologise, a mistake they cannot even acknowledge. The consequence of that is they continue to be completely unable to participate in constructing broad based support for climate action.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will not be supporting the Greens urgency motion today, because, yet again, it is characterised by misleading information. I'm sure that the Greens will see that as no impediment to posting online a whole lot of information misrepresenting Labor's position on climate action, polluting the political debate with misinformation. But let's be really clear: Labor is the only party with a track record of legislating for climate action and is the only party with the capacity to build a broad based consensus to transition us to a carbon neutral future. Right now, under this government, nothing is happening, and that is by design. That will not change until we change the government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to recent research from the University of Melbourne, the cost to Australia of not delivering on the goals of the Paris Agreement, a goal that requires net zero emissions by 2050, is a staggering $2.7 trillion.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span> Before the Greens called a quorum in this debate—a step that they've taken on multiple occasions for purposes that they're yet to explain—I was making the point that the costs of inaction are very significant for the Australian economy. At a time when we are looking for sources of growth, new sources of economic activity and new jobs, it is incredible that the government cannot see the opportunity that is staring them in the face. This is a goal that the CSIRO says will deliver higher wages, higher incomes and lower power costs. It's a goal that the University of Melbourne says will deliver 20 times greater benefits to the economy than any costs. The Business Council says getting to net zero by 2050 will mean $22 billion of new investment per year. All major Australian companies and the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Industry Group are committed to net zero emissions by 2050. Seventy-three countries, including the UK, Canada, France and Germany, have already adopted it as their goal. All states and territories in Australia have already promised to be carbon neutral by 2050, and the Australian and international communities are united in this commitment. But it's the Morrison government that refuses to accept the target and denies the science. It misleads and lies to the community and refuses to take action. These failures have a real-life impact. Our government should go to the Climate Ambition Summit with a plan for climate, energy and economic reform.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  I want to take you back 40 years. I was 20, and I was studying meteorology at Melbourne university. I had just learnt about the science of the greenhouse effect and the likely resultant changes to the world's climate from the burning of coal, gas and oil. I was shocked, and I thought: 'This is serious. The world needs to be doing something.' That day changed my life. It made me realise that if the world needed to be taking action then so did I. I had a responsibility to do what I could to protect our planet, and that resolve has continued through to the current day. But 40 years of the world not taking action in line with climate science—with my country, Australia, leading the way in inaction over the last seven years, after the highlight of the Greens-Labor government, the Gillard government, from 2010 to 2013—has been demoralising because we know now that we have not done enough. Yet we've got a government and an opposition that are still trying to debate the physics and saying that what we are doing is going to be sufficient, with the Labor Party unwilling even to commit to a 2030 target.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are really damaging effects of the climate crisis already baked in. We are living with the bleaching of our coral reefs, with the largest living organism on the planet, the Great Barrier Reef, having lost half of its corals in the last 25 years. We are living with the places we love being destroyed by fire. Our World Heritage Gondwanan rainforests, living time capsules that survived a continental break-up and a planetary mass extinction event, are being destroyed by the worst fires in thousands and thousands of years. We are living with the deaths of three billion animals. If we named each one of those animals, if we read out their names at a rate of one per second, it would take us 96 years to finish paying respect to them. We are living with millions of people every year being forced to move due to natural disasters, with global heating causing more frequent and more intense disasters and nearly one billion people living in areas of high or very high climate exposure. And we are living with the intense grief of knowing that we are all part of the web of life on this planet and feeling the pain and the trauma of that loss and the reality that life is going to be more difficult, more dangerous and less safe for our children and grandchildren than it has been for us. The denialism from the government and the Labor Party, pretending that they're doing enough and playing with figures, compounds our grief. In refusing to commit to shifting away from the mining, export and burning of coal, gas and oil at the speed and scale that are required, they create despair and disillusion, especially among young people, who know they are the ones who are going to be living through this crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, 40 years on, sadly, I no longer have optimism that we will act in time to turn this crisis around, but I continue to have hope that the world will see sense and at some stage take the urgent action that's required to shift to a zero-carbon economy at emergency speed. I'm no longer optimistic that Australia will be a leader, but I have hope that we will be dragged along as a laggard, and my hope is kindled when I see the UK government committing to reduce its emissions by 68 per cent by 2030. I know that Australia could do likewise. So on behalf of every person and every creature on this planet, on behalf of future generations, I urge the government and the Labor Party to build hope and dispel despair by similarly committing to ambitious carbon reduction targets in line with the science.</span>

In serving the people of Queensland and Australia, I want to firstly point out that the Greens last week wanted to declare a climate emergency because New Zealand did—not because of the science but because New Zealand did. The Greens wanted to declare a climate emergency because Japan did, yet Japan is building coal-fired power stations hand over fist. Now the Greens want to pledge to increase 2030 targets in line with the science. Listen to what the CSIRO has divulged. I asked them: where's the danger? They said they have never said there is any danger due to the human production of carbon dioxide—never—and they said they never would. If so, why the policy? Why the Greens rants?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the CSIRO admitted that today's temperatures are not unprecedented. That means we didn't cause the mild warming, that cyclical natural warming that ended in 1995—and it's been flat since. Ultimately the CSIRO relied not on empirical scientific data; it relied on climate models—invalidated and already proven wrong. What's more, the reliance on models means that they have got no empirical scientific evidence.</span>

In 1972 the United Nations environmental program started, with Maurice Strong as leader. In 1976 there was a ban on DDT. In 2006 the World Health Organization reinstated DDT's use. Forty to 50 million people died because of Maurice Strong. In 1980, Villach, Austria; in 1985, Villach, Austria again. These are the times when Maurice Strong hand-picked—</span>

Stop and think about what that actually means for a minute. It means that the life support systems of this planet are failing. And what do we get in debates from the major parties in this place while the climate is breaking down around us? We get denial and obfuscation from the government benches, and somehow what we're getting from Labor is, 'It's all the Greens fault.' Let me remind Senator McAllister: it is not the Greens but the Labor Party that still supports the Carmichael coalmine. It is not the Greens but the Labor Party that supports fracking the Beetaloo Basin. It is not the Greens but the Labor Party that supports fracking the Galilee Basin. It is not the Greens but the Labor Party, along with the Liberal Party, that still supports the tens of billions of dollars worth of direct public subsidies going straight into the pockets of the fossil fuel polluters in this country. But somehow, from Senator McAllister and Labor, it is all the Greens fault.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I've noticed in this debate as it's evolved over the years and the decades is that the rhetoric of climate denialism is shifting. It's shifting away from challenging the science—and I exclude Senator Roberts here, for obvious reasons. The mainstream climate deniers in this place have shifted away from trying to dispute the science, because the science is overwhelming. So what they do now is work on delay. One of the primary ways that political parties work on delay is by setting targets off in the never-never. And the party most culpable for doing that in this place is the Australian Labor Party, who have got a 2050 target. Fine; have a 2050 target—no problems there—but stop using it as cover for not having a 2030 target. The science is abundantly clear: we've got a decade or less left to take serious, significant and—yes, I will say it—radical action to save the life support systems on our planet, to fix the climate breakdown. Any political party that does not have a 2030 target might as well be a party of climate deniers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day the majors refuse to set a 2030 target in line with the science, they are deciding that the millions of dollars that they get from their deep-pocketed fossil fuel donors are more important than the lives of ordinary Australians and ultimately the climate that sustains all life on this planet. Every day they fail to have a 2030 emissions reduction target in line with the science, they condemn our country to more summers like the one that we just suffered through, they condemn the Great Barrier Reef to death and they condemn millions of animal species around this planet to extinction. What have they sold out all those things for? A few dirty dollars from their fossil fuel donors.</span>

Decade after decade we, the young people of Australia, have been demanding action from this parliament and yet all we hear in return is the same nonsense, the same robotic talking points delivered by one side of the chamber and the other. From one side of the chamber you get excuses and the literal talking points of the fossil fuel industry flowing forth into this place. From the other side, where the opposition sit, you see nothing but spinelessness and cowardice in the face of the greatest crisis ever to face the human species.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my state of Western Australia we have a state Labor government that is flush with hundreds of thousands of dollars funnelled to it by Chevron and Woodside Petroleum. At their behest, the government is selling our future down a gas poisoned river and is fracking the Kimberley. On the eve of our state election it dares to bring forth a so-called climate policy that does not retain within it an emissions reduction target and does not retain within it a renewable energy target. On the eve of a season of weather in our state that proves to be one of the most damaging in our history and at a moment in time in the history of our state when we as a community have come together like never before to keep ourselves safe from COVID and are now united in our desire to rebuild in a way that enables us to tackle the climate crisis, the McGowan government is making things worse. It is opening up our state to the wholesale selling of massive tracts of our land—massive tracts of country that has been sung and stewarded for tens of thousands of years—to the gas giants that are lining the government's pockets. </span>

It is a condemnation of this place that right now there are children across the country organising strikes and marches at a time when their focus should be on their education, their mental health and planning what they want to do with their lives. They are putting all that aside to plan demonstrations to plead with this place, to grab it by the scruff of the neck and to say: 'Please act. Our future is at stake.' It is a shame that that should be required of my generation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The High Court of Australia's annual report for 2019-20 outlines the High Court's response to 'allegations of sexual harassment against a former justice'. Of course, it is Justice Dyson Heydon of whom we speak. I would like to commend the Chief Justice of the High Court for her swift and comprehensive response, a response that stands in absolutely stark contrast to the response of those in this building and this government to similar allegations. The High Court immediately commissioned an independent investigation into the allegations, and the reviewer, Dr Vivienne Thom, was given a broad scope and support to ensure that her review was targeted towards ensuring similar allegations did not arise in future. Dr Thom's report made clear recommendations to review the culture within the High Court and to invite current and former staff to share their experiences and their views on what could be done to protect staff against sexual harassment. The Chief Justice agreed to all the recommendations. She met with the women who came forward; she believed them. She offered an unreserved apology and expressed her shame that the High Court had not provided them a safe workplace. She is taking steps to make sure that their experiences are not repeated and that the court has a robust complaints process that women can have confidence in. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's response to allegations of harassment and bullying within parliamentary offices pales in comparison. The complaints process that exists under the finance department remains weak and without practical consequence. There is little appetite from this government to tackle the culture that allows harassment to go unreported and unpunished. Few commitments have been made in the response to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> recommendations. Coming forward with allegations against those in power will always be difficult and will only happen if we create a culture in which complaints are handled respectfully and confidentially and taken seriously. I commend the brave associate in the High Court who came forward. I commend the High Court for its response and I call on the government to follow the example that the High Court has set, to take serious action to improve the culture in this building and to ensure that this building becomes a place that women can feel safe in.</span>

Senator Green, with my support, lodged a notice of motion last week on this topic seeking a copy of the review of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, also known as the NAIF, better known as the 'no actual infrastructure fund'. This is the $5 billion fund that was established by this government five years ago to fund projects and create jobs right across northern Australia. Five years on, we've seen that it has actually only spent $218 million. After five years, it has spent less than 5c in the dollar investing in projects across northern Australia and creating jobs across northern Australia. The NAIF was the centrepiece of the government's northern Australia agenda, which was launched five years ago. If there is any symbol of the failure of the government's northern Australia agenda and the fact that it has failed to live up to the expectations that were created, it is the NAIF. As we say often in this chamber, this Prime Minister and his government are very fond of making an announcement and very fond of getting a headline, but not quite so fond of actually following through and delivering. Again, the NAIF is a classic example of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think everyone in northern Australia were really excited about the northern Australia agenda being launched by this government five years ago and were really excited about the possibilities that the NAIF had in store. But unfortunately, it hasn't come to pass. It is just another example of this government making a flashy announcement then running back to Canberra and never actually following through. That's why the opposition last week lodged this notice of motion seeking a copy of the NAIF review. For the fourth time in five years, the NAIF has been reviewed by this government. It's had reviews from the Auditor-General. It's had other reviews internal to government. This review undertaken over the last 12 months has been by the department as required under the NAIF's legislation. As people who have an interest in what's happening in northern Australia and why this government has failed to deliver, we are keen to see this review of the NAIF.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has already flagged that it intends to make a number of amendments to the NAIF legislation in the new year. What we know about those so far seems encouraging. We obviously have to wait and see the legislation. Last week, the Senate inquiry into the effectiveness of the northern Australia agenda handed down a unanimous report across all parties making a number of recommendations that we hope the government will pick up when it comes to amending the NAIF's legislation. It would be very helpful to the parliament in making its decision on whether to support the government's amendments if we could actually see the review of the NAIF. I think it'd be very helpful to people across northern Australia who want to understand why the NAIF has been such a dismal failure to actually see the review that the government has been conducting. Let's get to the bottom of why it is that, five years on, less than 5c in the dollar has been spent from the NAIF. Unfortunately, probably the only characteristic of this government that matches its enthusiasm for making announcements that aren't actually delivered is its tendency to be utterly secretive and to hold back information from the Australian public. That's what has happened again in relation to the NAIF review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I see that the Minister representing the Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia, who is from South Australia, has entered the chamber. Perhaps she can enlighten us as to what the NAIF review has in place, or maybe her interest is primarily in South Australia rather than northern Australia. She and I often talk about this. It is very disappointing that the minister for northern Australia has written to Senator Ruston, as his representing minister, advising that he's not able to table the NAIF review today, as requested by the opposition. His reasoning is quite hard to understand. He goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The statutory review of the … (NAIF) was initiated by my predecessor Senator the Hon Matt Canavan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not quite sure why that's relevant to the decision of this minister—the new minister—not to table the review. Is it that he needs Senator Canavan's permission to table the NAIF review? I actually thought it was Minister Pitt who was now the minister for northern Australia, not former minister Canavan. We're reading every day that Senator Canavan is pretty eager to get back on the frontbench and get back in the saddle, so I'm not sure whether that's what Minister Pitt is referring to here by saying that the review was initiated by his predecessor, Senator Canavan. I really don't understand why that's relevant.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems Mr Pitt's real reason for not tabling the review is that the review has not yet been finalised. He says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He makes the usual excuse of the government that they haven't been able to finish it because of COVID, and says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">For this reason the timetable for the review was longer to ensure adequate time for consultation. Once finalised the NAIF review will be tabled in the Parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that the minister has agreed that, at some future date, he will table the review into the NAIF, but I suppose I question why it is that the government are out there making announcements that they will amend the NAIF's legislation and change various things to do with the NAIF, when they haven't even completed the review, let alone been willing to actually table the review. I would have thought that if the government were serious about making changes to the NAIF, as they say they are, they would have actually finished the NAIF review. We could then see what it says. It turns out this NAIF review is ongoing. It must be one of the longest reviews that we've ever seen. I think we've all resigned ourselves to the fact that the NAIF will take, at current rates, about 116 years to spend its $5 billion budget. I can only hope that the NAIF review is not going to take that long as well. We certainly encourage the minister and his department to finish the NAIF review and table the NAIF review so that we can get on and understand what the problem with the NAIF is and exactly what it is we need to fix.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I put this reference to the Rural and Regional Affairs References Committee, although I was considering potentially putting it to the Environment and Communications References Committee. It's long overdue in this country that we look at a basic and important component of fisheries management. Commonwealth commercial fisheries are designed around transferable statutory fishing rights, or SFRs, and fishing permits. Rules and regulations are attached to each of these. The aim is to establish a managed microeconomic system that creates incentives and guarantees to achieve the ecological, social and economic objectives set out in the Fisheries Management Act 1991.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the first point I really wanted to highlight: 1991. The system we have in place for our fisheries management, for transferrable quotas, goes back nearly 30 years. Hopefully, the Senate supports inquiring into this. If so, it will be exactly 30 years since this system was put in place. And, senators, do you know what? It's never been reviewed. I've had the Parliamentary Library do a literature search. Some aspects of the fisheries quota management system have been reviewed, but what about looking at whether it's achieving its purpose? Is it still fit for purpose? Does it achieve the environmental benefits that are so often claimed? Does it achieve the economic and social benefits to communities and so on and so forth? It's a long time since it's been looked at, and I believe it's long overdue for us to scrutinise the system to see if it needs improving, tweaking, reforming and overhauling. What other international benchmarks and standards could we look at, and where do we go from here? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I'm raising this is healthy oceans. Obviously, fisheries management is a critical component of healthy oceans. It's general accepted that Australia, using the fisheries management system, manages its fisheries better than most countries around the world, but that doesn't mean it's perfect. Indeed, there's always room for improvement. Our oceans are coming under more and more pressure as these cumulative impacts build up from ocean pollution like plastics—which we'll debate again tonight—and other sources of pollution as well as overfishing in other parts of the world. A lot of species that we fish, such as bluefin tuna, are migratory. As we see oceans acidify and, more critically, as our oceans warm, we lose important habitat and ecosystems. You would be very familiar with the giant kelp forests off Tasmania, Acting Deputy President Bilyk—an ancient ecosystem dating back millions of years. They stretched from Flinders Island in the north-east of Tasmania to the south-east cape. They have all but disappeared. They provided an immense ecological benefit to commercial fisheries and to all species in the ocean. They've gone. Up in the north, half of the coral cover of the Great Barrier Reef has gone in the last 12 years. And so on and so forth—sea grasses and reefs are under pressure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My point is a simple one: as our oceans come under more pressure we need to be very careful with how we manage our fisheries. We need to incorporate those changes we are seeing in the broader ecosystems into our fisheries management. We've got to have an ecosystems based approach to fisheries management. But if you look at the terms of reference that I've put up here, this is primarily not about looking at whether we've got our fisheries management right in terms of the science underpinning the quotas and whether we're necessarily managing the environmental aspects of fisheries sustainably. This is looking at the economic benefits of the way that we manage our fisheries. I'm very pleased that my Tasmanian college Senator Duniam is in the chamber tonight. I know he is close to the fishing industry in Tasmania and this is a matter near and dear to his heart, as it is to many Tasmanians, whether they are working in the commercial fishing sector or whether they are one of the many tens of thousands of recreational fishers in the state. By the way, those groups sometimes don't see eye to eye, but they do all agree that we need to manage our fisheries as effectively as possible and we need to get it right. Otherwise, there won't be any fishing in the future like there is today. That's plainly obvious to me—if we don't get it right. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Duniam understands that there is a big question in my home state hanging over whether the transferable quota system—for state fisheries or extending into Commonwealth fisheries—is delivering the economic and social benefits to our community. The Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies did a really interesting report. It was released in December 2019, over a year ago. Very politely—as often happens when a research institution like IMAS, with a lot of eminent scientists, put out a report that's well researched—they very clearly rang the bell that we need to do a lot more work on this. They questioned what benefits the average Tasmanian was getting from their fishery for a number of reasons and said that this needs to be looked at, that it certainly needs to be reviewed and that they didn't have the scope to do that in their report. They raised a number of issues with the quota based system; I'll go through some of those in a second. They said: 'The database is very limited. It's really hard to find information on this. There may be better ways to give benefits to our communities.' So in this inquiry I would like to pose a question to the Senate: has this managed microeconomic system, as I described it, established around this specific set of individual transferrable quotas and permits good fishing practice that is ecologically sustainable and produces good, dynamic economic and social community outcomes?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The terms of reference, as we've set out, are quite broad, deliberately so: Would this fishing quota practice result in good fishing practice, including that it is economically sustainable? How does the current quota system affect community fishers, and how do they feel it affects them? Does the current system disempower smaller fishers and benefit larger fishing groups? How does the quota system interact with the enforceability of ecological value of the current system and the current system's relationships to the health of the fisheries? Does the current system result in good fishing practice that is ecologically sustainable and economically dynamic? What of any other related matters?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Duniam is probably aware that, very recently, the Tasmanian rock lobster industry had their AGM. Rock lobsters, like abalone, are under a lot of pressure in Tasmania. Things have radically changed in the ecosystem, and the industry understands and respects that. They want to put in place a long-term plan for their industry. They want to put in place a 10-year plan that looks at the future of their industry. It would look at a lot of things, like where their markets were going to be given the problems we've had with China recently. They're very aware of how reliant they've been on China. They want to look at environmental changes that they've seen, like the loss of habitat, the loss of reefs—not just the loss of giant kelp reefs but the loss of reefs to invasive sea urchins that are a very, very pervasive problem—and how they interact with other fisheries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, Tasmanians in this chamber will understand we've been having to translocate rock lobsters from the south of Tasmania to the east coast so we have fish to catch. We're actually moving them. But that, I'm hearing, is creating problems from the places where they're moving them from, not to mention other aspects of that that I've heard about. The industry passed a motion at their last AGM wanting their representatives to do something about issues, particularly pertaining to ownership of quotas. Quotas can be owned because they're transferrable. They can be owned by corporations and they can be owned by investors, including super funds—how many of them, we don't know. But clearly many of the quotas are owned by foreign entities and foreign interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue came up—and this is a sensitive issue; I'll give you that—when Tasmanian rock lobsters were sitting on runways in China. The fishermen said to me, 'What we don't get is that we feel like we're being punished because of the trade war,' and the wine industry said the same thing. But their understanding is Chinese interests own a considerable amount of Tasmanian rock lobster quota. They're allowed to own our public resource, our fish, yet they're penalising us on the other hand. They don't quite get how it works. So I wanted to find out more about how much exactly is owned by foreign entities, corporate entities and investors—in short, not owner-operators in the industry—and the answer to that question is: nobody really knows. Talk about beneficial ownership problems within these corporate structures and holding companies; nobody really knows who owns these quotas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some rules around maximum ownership, but this is not just a problem that Australians are grappling with. This transferable quota system that's been used in fisheries overseas has led to a concentration of ownership in fisheries, where we're seeing bigger scale operations push out smaller owners. If you believe in the free market, you can say, 'Well, that's fine; that's what the free market's dictating.' But it's having impacts. Where I have my house in Bicheno, there are only two rock lobster boats left. There used to be 40 or 50. The Sunday session there used to be the most swinging Sunday session in the state. The pub doesn't even exist anymore. We have penguin tours and other things now that are filling the gap. But my point is this: the fisheries quota system might have been successfully managing our fishery compared to other jurisdictions internationally, but there really aren't that many fishermen left. Other countries have looked at this and said that, if you want to own quota, if you want to own our fisheries, you need to be whatever the nationality is. You need to Australian; you need to be Tasmanian. Other countries, including European countries, have said that you don't necessarily have to be, for example, Norwegian, but you need to have operated here for eight years as an owner-operator. They say: 'We want to see that you've committed yourself. You've bought your boat, you're employing locals, and you're committed to the long term of this industry, to its sustainability and its future.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fishermen in Tasmania don't even know what their succession plan is. This is not just a problem with fisheries. I've seen it in the wine industry and others. They've invested their livelihoods; they've bought all this knowledge from fishing, but where do they go? Do they just sell their quota to a foreign superannuation company or a US pension fund? What happens then? Who do they bring in to operate? I think it's high time we at least explore these issues. I'm not going to pre-empt what the answers are; I don't know that. But I know there are a lot of people out there with very strong views that it's time for a review. They have very strong views that things need to change if we're going to better manage our fisheries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To me, it comes back to the long-term sustainability of the industry, both ecologically and environmentally. Clearly, if quota holders are literally trying to squeeze every last dollar out of their ownership—for example, of Tasmanian abalone or Tasmanian rock lobster; they're very short term in their focus—that's not going to be good for the long-term ecological future of the industry. To give you an example: a quota was set in abalone last year on the east coast, but the abalone industry, at their AGM, for the first time ever, voted not to catch their quota. Even though the quota was given to them, they walked away from it that year and said, 'Things are pretty tough; we're not even going to catch our quota.' That's because they're invested in their industry; they understand it's under so much pressure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is also very much about community and economics: Is there a more sustainable way? Do we want smaller fishing operators who are more aligned with their community, who have long-term futures, who can actually train people, who can invest in new fishing practices and who can upgrade their technology? All these things are being asked by fishermen at the moment. I have no doubt at all that the genuine angst that I have seen will be something that we will take on board as a chamber. It's not just in my state of Tasmania; I've spoken to senators in here who know that this is an issue around the country. All I'm asking the Senate is: let's review it. It's been 30 years since the Howard government reformed fisheries and the Productivity Commission put in place the levy and the user-pays system and brought in transferable quotas. I accept that it was definitely better managed then than it was under licensing agreements previously, but that doesn't mean we've got it right. Let's have a look at it, let's see if we've got the settings right, and let's listen to the stakeholders and their concerns and see if we can improve the management of our fisheries and ultimately the health of our oceans.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:44</span>):  This evening Labor supports this motion calling for an inquiry into the fisheries quota system. We note that Australia's federal fisheries regulatory framework is indeed world-leading in ecologically sustainable fisheries management practices. The current regulatory framework under the Commonwealth includes two acts, with additional and complementary requirements, as we know, under the EPBC Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Commonwealth fisheries are notably sustainably managed in accordance with the precautionary principle, a requirement that is legislated in the Fishery Management Act and the 2005 ministerial direction which required Commonwealth fisheries to be quota managed. We believe that quota management is generally considered good practice from both a conservation and an economic point of view. We hope this inquiry will assist industry and the regulator to better maintain key commercial stock at ecologically sustainable levels and grow the Australian fisheries industry. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Forestry and Fisheries and Assistant Minister for Regional Tourism</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:45</span>):  I too am pleased to speak to the motion moved by Senator Whish-Wilson that is before the chamber around this reference to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. I am pleased with the acknowledgement that's been given to the fisheries sector tonight around how we do things here, perhaps better than most other parts of the world. But we also do acknowledge and accept the point that Senator Whish-Wilson made in his remarks, that there's always room for improvement, and I think anyone who doesn't agree with that is kidding themselves. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do agree with the point that Australia does assume a position as a bit of a world leader when it comes to fisheries management, and that is something both successive governments and the industry have to be very proud of, given the work that's been done to bring the industry to its current standard. This is the seventh consecutive year that Commonwealth fisheries in this nation have been found to be not overfished, which is a big tick for those who operate in our fisheries and for those who manage them. Seven years in a row we have seen positive results from the management of fish stocks in solely Commonwealth managed fisheries. Outcomes like this have been supported by our quota management of fisheries and by the pursuit of ecologically sustainable development, principles which have underpinned Australia's management for almost three decades, since 1991, as Senator Whish-Wilson pointed out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The principles of ecologically sustainable development are enshrined in Australian Fisheries Management Authority legislation, which incorporates three pillars—ecological, economic and social benefits. AFMA, the Australian Fishery Management Authority, takes a strong and practical approach to the management of fisheries, such as having robust frameworks, including total allowable catches, individual transferable quotas, harvest strategies and ecological risk assessments. I do want to take this opportunity to commend the team at AFMA. They do a fantastic job, especially in recent times. I acknowledge former fisheries minister Senator Ruston as well. They have done a fantastic job, particularly throughout the duration of the COVID pandemic and in trying to adhere to the international obligations that are put upon Australia that AFMA discharges, by being supportive and incredibly responsive to industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to point out that quota management ensures that we have a very secure supply of seafood now and into the future. Management of fish stocks is incredibly important. This is not a matter of just setting and forgetting. It was a point that Senator Whish-Wilson made—industry is very adaptive, very responsive, to the conditions it operates in. The industry knows the waters better than anyone else and knows what's going on. We have heard of two examples in Tasmania where changes have been made by industry around industry conduct. And it is important to acknowledge that those in the industry are, as custodians of the resource and the environment it exists in, good managers, good custodians; hence the world-leader status.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">AFMA continually improves these processes and our country's ability to maintain a healthy marine ecosystem, with the sustainable quota system forming a key component of its approach. This not only ensures access to our seafood, which for good reason is recognised globally for its quality, safety and, indeed, its tastiness but also supports a range of community benefits with economic gains, not only jobs but also recreational and Indigenous cultural fishing and tourism as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've already mentioned, we as a government are very proud, as I'm sure many in this chamber are—whatever political background they come from—of our fishing industry and, indeed, the management practices it employs. I do look forward to all of that being well on display and demonstrated through the inquiry at the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  For the last three years, the government have presided over bushfires, climate change, mass extinction and a major waste crisis without taking meaningful action. Meanwhile, our oceans, our rivers, our lands and our country are being choked with waste. The Greens have been consistent in this parliament about what needs to be done. More importantly, we've been working with grassroots mobs and community groups fighting to end plastic pollution in our oceans, rivers and lands. Senator Ludlam in 2009 introduced a private member's bill for a mandatory cash-for-containers scheme, but those opposite voted it down in 2013. If we had a good and caring government, one that wasn't there for themselves but actually cared for country, then they would have strengthened our response to the waste crisis and addressed how we produce and consume waste, particularly plastics. Every single bit of plastic that anyone has ever used still exists, and it's choking our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are making a big song and dance about this bill, flashing it around to take some heat off them while they take a chainsaw to our national environment laws, in some instances literally, like the chainsaws that tore through Djab Wurrung country. Do not be fooled. This is the first national waste legislation we have seen in over 10 years. This legislation, if passed, will be a massive missed opportunity, as it is without substantive amendments. It doesn't address plastic packaging. Think about that. The biggest reform in a decade to go through this place about the waste that we create doesn't address plastic packaging, the actual source of the problem and why our rivers and oceans are being choked in the first place. Here we are with a dodgy bill that is all headline and no substance. That's what happens when you have a government that is led by the marketing department. A good and caring government would do something about protecting our oceans and waterways from plastics. In the absence of that government, it's up to the Greens to amend this bill to make the issue of plastic pollution a priority. More needs to be done, and we are here to do it. I urge the government to agree to our amendments, which make sensible improvements to the bills to make a real difference to our oceans, our rivers, our lands and our waters.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations people cared for country, lands and waters because we are connected to them in ways most people could never, ever understand. When this country was colonised its colonisers and settlers came in here thinking that this was their land and that they had nothing to learn from its First Peoples. It's only taken 240 years to trash, burn and desecrate our country. We lived, thrived, survived and sustained for thousands and thousands of generations. The colonisers came and you are all beneficiaries of the stolen wealth of this country, It took only a couple of hundred years for you to destroy it all, and now we've got the climate emergency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know a thing or two about managing country and looking after country. You might want to start listening to the First Peoples of the land. We know how to do it. We even have three- and four-year-old kids talking about how we need to reduce plastic. If you go to any kindergarten—in fact, you might want to learn from this—or preschool, you'll find that they're teaching our children how bad plastic straws are. I have my granddaughters FaceTiming me to show me their new recyclable straws and other things they're getting from their kindergartens, because that's where they are getting a real education. Obviously, that wasn't available to our government members at the time when they were at kinder, and that's why plastic is not a big concern for them. Listen to us and learn from us, or go to kindergartens and learn from the kids. Your first step should be agreeing to our amendments to this bill and listening to the three- and four-year-olds, who would also agree, because, if we look after country, country will look after us.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:56</span>):  In speaking to the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and related bills, this legislative monument to this government's lack of ambition, I wouldn't be able to do justice to this contribution without first acknowledging my esteemed colleague Senator Whish-Wilson, the good senator from Tasmania, or, as he's known by those who follow him on Instagram and Twitter, the 'Senator Surfer' himself. Pete's a good mate of mine. We've worked together for a good many years now, and I have to say in all seriousness that I don't think there is anybody who quite matches his passion for the oceans, his passion for our precious places and his desire to see, particularly, our rivers and oceans freed of the scourge of plastics that so choke them all around the planet. We know that the issue of plastics, including microplastics, in our oceans is of great urgency, both as something that is affecting our precious places and their livability for the countless creatures that call them home and because the presence of plastic in our food chains is leading to negative health impacts for those in our communities. We know that if we don't take action here in Australia, in the Asia-Pacific and, indeed, globally then our oceans will become choked and our precious places will become polluted with plastic. Indeed, global consumption of plastic is on track to triple by 2040.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eighty per cent of marine debris is plastic and 40 per cent of plastic is single use, with an average lifespan of just 12 minutes. It's an absolute disgrace.  It is estimated that at least eight million tonnes of plastic makes its way into our oceans every year, totalling 80 per cent of marine debris. Numerous studies have shown that the majority of plastic pollution found on Australian beaches is produced and consumed locally. We are polluting our own blue backyard. We are only recycling 16 per cent of plastic packaging as of this current moment. So what we have is a global challenge of significant proportion, one which is being, I think it is fair to say, disproportionately contributed to by the Asia-Pacific region. And we have a situation where Australia, as a member of that region, is not only failing to do its part; it is currently disproportionately contributing to the problem. In the face of this global and regional challenge we have this piece of legislation, much vaunted by the Prime Minister and often deployed, in my opinion, as a distraction from the great, howling, corporately funded void. Where more substantive environmental and climate based policy should be we have this legislation around which a big game is talked, around which the Prime Minister likes to draw great attention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some quite fine aspirations and intentions lying behind certain aspects of this bill. It is necessary that we ban the exportation of our waste overseas, and this is the first time that legislation in relation to a national approach to waste has come before the parliament in a decade. But it is very important not to be fooled by the hype and the bluster; this is a massive missed opportunity, and if passed in its current form that missed opportunity will only increase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government was serious about recycling and waste reduction, we would have seen a lot more in this bill, particularly in relation to plastics. Critically, if we were serious about both addressing this problem and doing so in a way that is socially just, putting the responsibility of that addressing fairly and squarely on those who generated it and caused this crisis most, we would see aspects within this legislation that would make corporations responsible for their contribution to this massive problem, to the work and the vandalism environmentally that they have done to our oceans and to our broader natural environment. We see none of these aspects in this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation seeks to ban the national export of waste while putting in place none of the measures needed to create and support a national recycling industry here in Australia—a national recycling industry which would create thousands upon thousands of good jobs. This is a wasted opportunity that is being wasted on behest of massive corporations that are donors to the Liberal Party—shock, horror, aghast; who'd have thunk it! But it is really worth zeroing back in on the proposition at the heart of this legislation, that being that you can ban the export of these types of waste in the absence of the setting up of an effective national structure to then manage that waste—something which is particularly egregious given that those that understand recycling and waste management have been desperately lobbying the government. Senator Whish-Wilson has informed me on many occasions of the effort and work done by the industry to attempt to get the government to the table ahead of what was a very easily foreseeable decision on behalf of countries like China to stop taking our waste. But the government refused to listen, refused to engage, and now, even today, presents a piece of legislation which doesn't really do the job.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After reaching for a way to clearly explain what is fundamentally proposed in this bill, I ask people to imagine how they would feel and what their view would be should they have complained for a decade or more about having a leaking sewer system in their house and if, after 10 years, a plumber finally comes out to their place and says: 'Oh, you've got a pretty busted pipe there. The solution, in my view, is just to shut off your access to water, shut off your access to the toilet and shit on the floor.' Now, that would not be something that folks would accept, and yet that is the proposition at the heart of this legislation—that we stop sending this stuff overseas—</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Acting Deputy President. That's the contention at the centre of this bill—that we stop sending our waste overseas and that we keep it here while doing nothing to address the core reasons that it's created and do not a damn thing, not a damn thing, to hold corporations to account for their creation of this waste, for building into the system wasteful processes that make it more difficult to care for and manage waste. You will not see a single line in this bill that talks about product stewardship, one of the central tenets of addressing waste and recycling. There is nowhere near enough emphasis on making sure that corporations that manufacture and profit from the creation of wasteful products actually do their bit in cleaning up the outcome. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to speak—and I will zero back in on this during the committee stage of the debate, with the leave of my good Tasmanian colleague—on an often overlooked element of this debate, and that is that there are folks in our community for whom certain plastic products are not a mere convenience but indeed a mobility aid. Here, of course, I talk about plastic straws and the need by many disabled people in our community to utilise plastic straws in our consumption of food and beverages and what have you. I said that rather robotically; what I should say is that sometimes you need a plastic straw to be able to go out of an evening and smash a JD with your mates! That's just the way it works. The reality is that the renewable, recyclable equivalents of straws—reusable straws, for instance—are not yet up to scratch to be able to replace their plastic counterparts. There are also challenges when it comes to the safety of some straw replacements. Metal straws, for instance, might result in harm to folks in our community who experience periodic spasmodic muscle episodes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can imagine, we in the Greens have heard very clearly from the disability community about the need to address these issues appropriately in any legislation in these areas, recognising that fundamentally, centrally, the need, the pressure—the emphasis, the expectation—to create alternative solutions should fall upon manufacturers. It should not be the responsibility of disabled people to advocate their right to be able to consume food and liquid like the rest of the community. Although we must limit the use of plastic products to the greatest degree possible, we must do so while continuing to allow disabled people to use some of them as the necessary mobility aid that they are for so many people. That is why, within the amendments being moved by Senator Whish-Wilson in the course of this debate, there will be targeted exemptions created for the purpose of allowing these products to still be accessed and used by disabled people when they need them. I shall talk in more detail about those exemptions during the committee stage, but, for the second reading period of the debate, I think I shall leave it there.</span>

We take this issue so seriously we are one of the first nations to have actually stepped out and said, 'We are going stop exporting waste; we are going to deal with it on shore.' To do this, we need these bills to pass, and I am absolutely amazed that the Greens aren't backing us 100 per cent in doing this. This legislation implements that export ban so we stop exporting our problems to other nations.</span>

They want us to stop sensible forestry in this nation, where we have a sustainable long-term forestry policy; they'd rather have us export forestry so we see massive clearing in other nations. We have to stop exporting our problems. We have to continue, in this nation, to implement policies that increase our sustainability, both for our environment and for our international obligations, and also for our industry.</span>

This legislation will also incorporate the existing Product Stewardship Act 2011, with improvements to encourage companies to take greater responsibility for the waste they generate, including through better product design and increased recovery and re-use of waste materials. What in that is going to be a problem? This legislation will lead to increased recycling and increased remanufacturing of waste materials, which will transform our waste and recycling industries, boost jobs and, importantly, provide massive opportunities for regional areas that have the space to develop waste-recycling and waste-remanufacturing warehouses and the capacity to deal with it. This legislation is good for the environment, good for jobs and good for regions. I'm still struggling to see what the problem with this legislation is.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The important thing about this legislation, when we're talking about the recycling and waste reduction components of it, is that it provides a framework for three kinds of product stewardship schemes: voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory. The voluntary product stewardship scheme drives action to reduce the negative impacts of waste from products and materials on the environment. Again, where's the problem in that? It is a good thing. It also provides accreditation of voluntary product stewardship schemes. A member of such an arrangement can use the product stewardship logo on their products to signal to the community that they are taking responsibility for the waste their product generates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The co-regulatory product stewardship scheme is a combination of industry action and government regulation where government sets the minimum outcomes and operational requirements while the industry has some discretion about how those requirements and outcomes are achieved. The National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme is a successful and well-established co-regulatory product stewardship scheme that will continue under this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mandatory product stewardship scheme can require a person, such as a manufacturer, importer or distributor of a product, to take specific actions in relation to a product. The mandatory requirements may be imposed where there is a high level of environmental or human health risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has consulted widely on this legislation. The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment have conducted this consultation over the past couple of years on these measures, including discussion papers, industry consultation and a regulatory impact statement. Now we have finally have the bills before us, and I can see no reason not to support these bills. I commend them to the chamber.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance, Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:14</span>):  I thank senators for their contributions in the debate on these bills: the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020, the Recycling and Waste Reduction (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2020, the Recycling and Waste Reduction Charges (General) Bill 2020, the Recycling and Waste Reduction Charges (Customs) Bill 2020 and the Recycling and Waste Reduction Charges (Excise) Bill 2020. They represent, across the bills, a package of legislation that implements the commitment agreed by all Australian governments, working cooperatively at a state, territory and Commonwealth level, to ban unprocessed waste exports, to strengthen existing product stewardship legislation and to provide a national legislative framework for recycling and waste reduction, now and into the future. This will enable Australia to realise the full economic value of waste and to maximise the ability of our waste management and recycling sector to recover and remanufacture waste materials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills will see significant and positive benefit through the creation of jobs, growing the Australian economy and, crucially, reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfill. The supporting Recycling Modernisation Fund, announced by our government in July, will see a $1 billion transformation of Australia's domestic waste and recycling facilities, building a sustainable waste and recycling sector to process the waste streams we've been sending offshore. As our Prime Minister has said, it's our waste; it's our responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills introduced by our government seek to turbocharge Australia's approach to product stewardship, to develop a circular economy by encouraging businesses to take greater responsibility to reduce the environmental footprint of products across their life cycle. Our government is taking specific action in relation to plastics waste. Since the waste export ban was agreed, under the leadership of Prime Minister Morrison, exports of plastics waste alone have fallen by around 5,000 tonnes per month. That is the equivalent of the weight of the Royal Australian Navy's two largest ships, each year, being saved in terms of plastics waste exports from Australia. Our government is developing a national plastics plan informed by the ideas and suggestions raised at the first ever National Plastics Summit in March. The plan will include initiatives to reduce plastics pollution by targeting every single stage of the plastics life cycle and will recognise that everyone, including governments, industry and the community, has a vital role to play in managing our plastics waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the National Product Stewardship Investment Fund, $10.5 million will be provided to support 15 projects to reduce waste and improve recycling. One of these projects, run by the Australian Food and Grocery Council, will recycle and reprocess 190,000 tonnes of soft plastic packaging per year. That's the equivalent of almost 200 billion chocolate wrappers. That's even beyond the capacity of my nine-year-old daughter or her younger sibling! Under the government's $1.1 million funded national consumer education program, the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation will deliver a series of campaigns to improve consumer and household recycling awareness and behaviours to improve the resource recovery outcomes for packaging. The Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation are also working to gain government accreditation for a voluntary product stewardship scheme for packaging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee considered the provisions in these bills in detail and recommended they be passed. I thank the committee for their work and their support and their consideration of these important aspects. The committee made three additional recommendations: first, that the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment continue its engagement with state, territory and local governments, as well as with industry, business and environmental stakeholders, in the implementation of these bills, particularly with reference to costs, penalties and the proposed 'naming and shaming' criteria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can confirm that the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment will continue to work closely with a broad range of stakeholders to implement each phase of the waste export ban and to further the product stewardship outcomes sought through this legislation. This will include consultation to ensure stakeholders understand the minister's expectations on recommended actions and time frames for products listed on the minister's priority list. Organisations will be given ample opportunity to do the right thing prior to being named and shamed. The department will also provide guidance on potential compliance action and penalties for breaches of the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the 2020-21 budget handed down in October this year, our government announced that it would defer introducing fees and charges by setting them at zero dollars when the regulation starts. This is to provide relief for businesses dealing with the economic impacts of COVID-19 and to give businesses time to adjust to the new regulations. This will mean that exporters will not have to pay for an assessment of a waste export licence or to make an export declaration for the first 2½ years of the scheme. The department will instead start recovering the costs of administering the regulation from 1 July 2023 and will prepare a cost-recovery implementation statement in 2022. This will allow for meaningful consultation with stakeholders on the proposed approach to cost recovery and the amount of any charges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should recognise that our government is proceeding with these very important reforms and measures to better ensure that Australia takes responsibility for its waste in the environment of a global pandemic. Notwithstanding the changes that the world has seen through the course of 2020, we have maintained momentum and commitment to these reforms while recognising, through that Senate committee process and as a result of the advice coming forward, that we do need to be mindful of the costs and impacts on Australian businesses as well. We need to make sure that we get outcomes in waste and recycling but not in a way that is at the expense of Australian business competitiveness and capability. In fact, we need to do so in a way that builds, as our government has sought to, jobs and opportunities for more Australians in the management of waste and recycling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second recommendation of the Senate inquiry was that the Commonwealth have a specific focus on achieving alignment of infrastructure, investment and data when working with state, territory and local governments to coordinate the implementation of the bills and broader reform to waste management and recycling. Our government is working closely with states, territories and local governments to implement a program of waste reform measures with a view to aligning infrastructure, investment and data. This includes supporting consistency around single-use plastic bans and delivering agreed national data and reporting improvements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our $190 million Recycling Modernisation Fund will leverage some $600 million of co-investment from state and territory governments and from Australian industry for critical waste infrastructure. I welcome and applaud the drive and cooperation that we are finding from states and territories and from Australian industry to invest in the types of recycling capabilities and plant capacity that are necessary for the vision and reforms we're applying to be able to be delivered and implemented in a timely way and that ensure that we do achieve the optimal outcomes of reduced waste going to landfill, reduced waste going overseas and enhanced recycling in a way that builds long-term profitable, commercially viable industries that reuse those products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The type of co-investment from the Recycling Modernisation Fund working with state and territory governments and industry will create an estimated 10,000 jobs and divert 10 million tonnes of waste from landfill. This will ensure that Australia has the necessary waste management and recycling capacity in place by 2024, when the full waste export ban comes into effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Waste Policy Action Plan also features several actions where the Commonwealth will work closely with the state, territory and local governments. These include supporting consistency around single-use plastics bans, delivering agreed national data and reporting improvements, and aligning education efforts around reducing food waste. Many jurisdictions have shown different approaches in leadership when it comes to tackling questions like single-use plastics bans. These initiatives from states and territories are important, but to ensure we get both the optimal environmental outcomes and the most efficient and effective regulatory measures in place that minimise negative impacts on the economy and maximise potential positive impacts on the economy, cooperation and national harmonisation on issues like single-use plastics bans are crucial—as, indeed, is ensuring that the sharing and knowledge that can come from enhanced national data and reporting capabilities will help to drive investment in the right sectors of our recycling industry and will help to ensure that the necessary industry advances are achieved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third recommendation that came from the Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications investigation of these bills was for the government to expedite consideration of a cost-benefit analysis of large infrastructure projects, including mandatory targets for the use of a percentage of recycled material. The cost-benefit analysis that underpinned the former Council of Australian Governments decision regulation impact statement for the waste export ban assumed $250 million of investments in new technologies and infrastructure and some $100 million to support domestic demand for recycled products. This analysis found that the waste export ban and associated investment in infrastructure is expected to see the Australian economy grow by $3.6 billion in turnover and $1.5 billion in GDP over a 20-year period. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a clear demonstration of the type of virtuous cycle that we seek to achieve through these reforms and this investment that has the Australian government taking responsibility and Australians taking responsibility for Australian waste—that we cease the practice of unnecessary export of that waste into our region and pushing those environmental and ecological pressures onto other nations in other locations and instead take back responsibility. In doing so, we seek to embrace the potential that technology provides for us to be able to reuse, recycle and generate enhanced economic outcomes as a result of that. That, of course, is the consistent theme right across our government's environmental policies and approaches—our determination to invest in technology and capability that achieves environmental outcomes in a manner that supports Australian jobs and Australian livelihoods, rather than taxes or takes away from them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth Procurement Rules, I'm pleased to advise, are being amended to strengthen the requirement to consider environmental sustainability in the use of recycled content when determining value for money in purchasing decisions. In fact, I can advise they have been amended; as finance minister I can recollect publishing those updated Commonwealth Procurement Rules at the end of last week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that there were four additional recommendations made through that Senate inquiry by the Australian Greens. I note Senator Whish-Wilson has proposed to amend the bills in the Senate to implement these recommendations through amendment sheets 1029, 1043 and 1052. The government does not agree with these recommendations and, as such, does not support the amendments flagged by the Australian Greens. The fourth amendment—that the bill be reviewed five years after its commencement—I'm pleased to inform the Senate, was already implemented through a government amendment to the bill in the House of Representatives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's my pleasure to commend these bills to the chamber. These are important reforms that ensure that Australia is well placed in terms of our ability to deliver an enhanced recycling and waste reduction regime and to do it in a way that creates jobs and enhances and delivers on our environmental commitments to the region in which we live.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:38</span>):  I'll warn senators that I might be talking for a while. It doesn't mean I won't call a quorum, so don't count your chickens! I have a number of amendments to move tonight. The government has actually made six or seven minor amendments to the legislation before us tonight after speaking with the Greens—Senator Birmingham touched on it in his speech. Senators are probably aware that it takes some time for these things to come together. We've been having discussions for a number of months with key stakeholders. We circulated our amendments that are before the Senate tonight, I would have thought, nearly two months ago. There have been some minor revisions, and we've made some changes, but we've been very conscious to make sure that everybody has seen these amendments. Two of them are substantive. I thank senators for their time, especially in recent days, going through those substantive amendments with us. We wanted to get that very clear upfront. We've circulated these with plenty of time. I understand that there may be reasons why political parties will vote against the Greens' amendments tonight, but I certainly hope they're not on the back of minor technical details, because we've put an incredible effort into trying to work through this with everyone. I want to acknowledge, again, Minister Trevor Evans in the other place. Thank you for listening to some of our concerns. As I said, there are six or seven amendments that the government has already put in. They were fairly minor, but they were nevertheless important, especially in terms of stakeholders wanting to be more confident that this is going to be a robust piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Birmingham mentioned that the government had consulted very broadly in putting this legislation together. Having been through a separate Senate inquiry, which I talked about in my second reading speech on the Greens' private member's bill which our amendments are based on, I'm very familiar with who all the stakeholders are. May I say that consultation is not the same thing as listening to stakeholders as to what they want. If you'd consulted broadly and you'd listened to key stakeholders, you would be supporting the Greens' amendments and we wouldn't be having a committee stage tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to very briefly remind the Senate of who those key stakeholders are. They're local governments around the country and local government organisations that support mandatory product stewardship schemes and support banning problematic single-use plastics. There are the environment movement and community groups, like Plastic Free July, and a whole range of groups that also support mandatory schemes and banning single-use plastics. Then, of course, there's the recycling industry, which I mentioned. Recyclers in Australia employ over 60,000 Australians. They have made it very clear in the Senate inquiry, to Senator Birmingham, and in the Senate inquiry into the Greens' private member's bill that they demand mandatory product stewardship schemes. They have been there for the last 30 years and seen the packaging industry consistently fail, under voluntary schemes or coregulatory schemes, to meet their targets. They say, 'If you want us to put money into your recycling funds, if you want us to co-invest, if you want us to upgrade our infrastructure, our technology and our processes, we need the architecture right.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth stakeholder is the packaging industry. No jellybeans for guessing who doesn't want a mandatory scheme—it's the packaging industry. However, as I mentioned in my second reading speech, those in the industry were very clear that, with the voluntary schemes that this bill enshrines in law—it takes existing ambition and says: 'These are your voluntary schemes. We're going to put them into law'—they're going to meet those voluntary schemes. They're very confident they're going to meet their 2025 targets. The Food and Grocery Council said that. Woolworths said that. Amcor said that. It's been very clear that they're very confident they're going to meet their targets. Senator Birmingham also referenced additional costs. We have to be very careful, in this environment, about imposing costs. Woolworths said black and white in the Senate inquiry that, because they're taking their voluntary scheme so seriously and they're so determined to meet their 2025 targets, there will be no additional cost to them of a mandatory scheme because they have to do the same thing anyway. That comes directly from a company that has consistently opposed any kind of government regulation around plastics. That's what they said in a Senate inquiry. I'm happy to read those things to senators or to the minister if they haven't seen those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This frames up where we are tonight. If we actually want to take real action on plastic pollution and we want to create real jobs then we need to vote for these amendments. It's very much a half-cocked approach to say, 'We're going to ban the export of problematic wastes like plastics', which puts the onus back on us to deal with them, and then on the other hand say, 'We're not going to put in place the architecture that successfully does that, that builds a circular economy so that everything is designed for its end of life.' The recycling industry are saying, for example: 'We do not have faith or any confidence that the packaging industry will meet their targets. If you want us to invest, if you want Australian jobs and if you want to fix the problem, give us some certainty.' That's what we can do tonight. I seek leave to move together my amendments on single-use plastic, which are on sheet 1030 revised.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me start by talking to these amendments. I was very pleased with Senator Birmingham's contribution, in which he talked about the need to harmonise—that's a word that has come up consistently in our Senate inquiries—a state based approach to banning single-use plastics. Back in 2017, in a world-first Senate inquiry that a number of us participated in—I was very proud that this Senate looked into the problem of marine plastic pollution—one of the recommendations was to ban certain single-use plastics. Unfortunately the European Parliament beat us. They were the first parliament in the world to look at what they found on their beaches and in their oceans. Their definition of a single-use plastic was something that had a readily available alternative so that it wasn't going to inconvenience customers or businesses. They could determine what those plastic products were—like plastic cutlery, for example—and they could say: 'We don't need that. We are going to ban the sale of it. We are going to ban the production of it. There are better alternatives.' So the European Parliament came up with this legislation that was world-beating. I was quite keen to include some of that in an amendment, but after discussions with Labor we have revised certain aspects of our other amendments to incorporate just the packaging covenant ambition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To get back to single-use plastics, the European Union have done this, so it's definitely possible. The Prime Minister claims he told the UN he wanted to act on plastic pollution. If he wanted to do one thing in this parliament, just one thing, to stop plastics going into the ocean, he would do what the European Union did—take the 10 most common plastics we find in the ocean that we've already got alternatives for and simply ban them. That would be the most important thing he could do. But that's not on the table. It's not on the cards tonight, except in a Greens amendment. No-one has been able to give me a good reason why, especially, and here's the rub, since the states are already doing it. Recently Queensland banned certain single-use plastics. South Australia led the charge, as they did around container deposit schemes many years ago. Western Australia has just put in place a ban on single-use plastics. Sadly, Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales haven't followed yet but they are very likely to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether they're the packaging industry, whether they're the recycling industry or whether they're local government—who, by the way, are also banning single-use plastics in their local jurisdictions—everybody agrees that we need a national scheme. We need harmonisation. I accept it's not going to happen overnight. That's why we have given in these bills, after consultation, plenty of time for this ban to come into place, where we actually harmonise the scheme. It's good for business, it's good for the ocean and it's exactly what the Australian public want, let me tell you. They are ready for a ban on problematic single-use plastics.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="250156" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  I would like to speak to these particular amendments because they showcase how important it is, as we legislate around these critical issues, to be engaged with all of the communities in different states that may well be affected by legislation as it passes through this place. The reality is that disabled people are very much environmentalists too. We don't want to have to, in the course of these debates, choose between the mobility aids that we need to live our daily lives and the action to protect our environment that we know is so urgently needed. We don't want to have to put our own care needs above the environment, and we have an effective solution to this that ensures that our voices are part of a process of implementing policies which interact with our care needs. This is a really critical point: to avoid ending up in a situation where you've got yourself a really damaging dichotomy, it is so important to engage with disabled people in these processes. We have done just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Whish-Wilson and I worked with the disability community over the process of putting together these amendments and it became very clear that there were a number of issues that needed to be addressed, one of which is the reality that renewable straws are not appropriate or usable by many disabled people; there are various reasons why disabled people require plastic straws and why some do not have the ability to use alternatives such as metal, paper, glass, bamboo or—indeed—silicone straws as has been proposed by some. Often these issues relate to the nature of the person's impairment. Some of the other reasons raised by the community include the fact that these options can potentially harm disabled people, and they include choking hazards and quite serious injuries. Non-plastic straws also create difficulties with being able to appropriately position and use. They can incur a higher cost and many of them are not safe to use with high-temperature liquids.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can create solutions to the massive environmental challenges that face our society while also being inclusive of disabled people, and I think this is the important point. There is work to be done in the development of renewable straws and reusable straws that do meet these accessibility requirements, and the pressure and the onus to make these developments must lie fairly and squarely with manufacturers. It should not be the responsibility of disabled people to advocate for their right to consume foods and liquids like the rest of the community. Limiting the use of plastic products to the greatest degree possible whilst continuing to allow them to be available as a necessary tool for disabled people to use to eat and drink isn't unreasonable; it is, indeed, very achievable. We have specific sections of the propositions put forward by Senator Whish-Wilson which deal with this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, we have worked closely with community to develop these solutions, and we would like to acknowledge that banning plastic straws and the conversations that often take place around these topics impact on disabled people. They're often a source of distress because being able to go out in public, to be able to drink in public and socialise and participate in community life, is really important. That is why, into this proposition, we have built in relevant exemptions. One amendment has within its sections exemptions which relate specifically to the need to use plastic straws as a mobility aid.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

It may be that we aren't able to provide support for some of the amendments that have been circulated. But, in relation to the amendments before us now, we will be opposing those amendments. It's true that some single-use plastics are unnecessary and harmful, and they should be designed out and eliminated as soon as possible. As Senator Whish-Wilson indicated, some state and territory governments already have or are planning to take legislative action to do exactly this. It really doesn't make sense for these things to happen one by one without the coordinated support of the federal government. Nonetheless, it's not responsible to try and tackle this issue through an amendment without coordinating the reform process with those states and territories, and also seeking an analysis of the impact of the approach that's selected. It's on those grounds that we are not in a position to support these amendments tonight.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do call on the Morrison government to stop abrogating what should be the Commonwealth's national leadership role. We should seek to avoid repeating what has happened with container deposit schemes, where there are different schemes and different arrangements across different states and territories. Senator Whish-Wilson referred to harmonisation. The only entity that is possibly capable of doing that is the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth should take that responsibility and commence work with states and territories on this question.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:58</span>):  I might start with a question for the minister on these amendments. Perhaps I could very quickly run through this, because it's the most common question I get asked by people: 'What does a single-use plastic ban actually mean?' The media say: 'What are you actually going to ban?' So, very quickly, by 1 January 2022, this exemption would ban lightweight carrier bags—some of which have been banned in states, but not comprehensively—and microbeads, which are still part of a voluntary scheme and haven't been totally banned. By 1 January 2023, in three years time, six-pack plastic ring holders would be banned. If you don't think they're bad news in the oceans, go onto my Instagram—I'll give myself, Senator Surfer, a plug—and have a look. There's a bit of joviality there, but the picture is very serious. It's a photo of a fairy penguin in my home state of Tasmania taken by a friend of mine, a bushwalker. He runs a big shop in Launceston and is quite well known. The penguin's been choked by one of the six rings; the other five are sticking out from around its neck. You can clearly see where this poor distressed bird has suffocated from plastic ingestion, like—and I don't exaggerate this—millions of other sea creatures. We know hundreds of thousands of birds alone die from plastic ingestion, not to mention other creatures who cross paths with a whole range of different plastics in the ocean.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we want to remove cotton buds; balloon sticks; straws; stirrers; cutlery; plates, bowls and other dishes; polystyrene food and beverage containers; and oxo-degradable food and beverage containers. I will state that, even in the recent Western Australian government ban, they highlighted the need for federal coordination at some stage. So here is my question to the minister. These are products that have readily available alternatives, and the list is based on the EU legislation. Minister, are you familiar with the directive of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment, commonly referred to as the EU directive, which was passed in March 2019 and formally adopted by the Council of the European Union in May 2019? Are you aware of the details of that legislation and the fact that they banned these harmful single-use plastics to protect the ocean?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance, Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:01</span>):  Thanks, Senator Whish-Wilson. I thank you for your amendments and, at the outset, thank you for the thoughtful contribution you made in moving the amendments and Senator Steele-John for his contribution in terms of the framing of the amendments and some of the exemptions that were considered and placed by the Australian Greens in these amendments. I thank you because I know that the amendments and, indeed, the contributions you've made come from a very genuine place in both of your instances. The outcomes that you are seeking to achieve through these amendments are outcomes that I think Senator McAllister indicated sympathy for, and they're also outcomes that the government has sympathy for in terms of seeing, ultimately, an end of use, manufacture, import and distribution in relation to the plastics that you've cited in your amendment, such as shopping bags, straws and microbeads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you acknowledged in your contribution, Senator Whish-Wilson, states are already legislating to phase out a number of single-use plastics, and the Commonwealth does look to play a supportive and, where possible, coordinating role over time in this regard. I referenced in my contribution the National Plastics Summit that brought together states, territories, industry and others in March of this year, which is outlining the development of a national plastics plan. That seeks to target the different stages of the plastic life cycle, and I think that, along with other fora that bring together Commonwealth, state and territory environment ministers, provides an opportunity for us to work towards a greater harmonisation in relation to the steps that the states are taking. We welcome that. Industry too are taking steps, and we note that there has been a substantial phasing out of microbeads. Some estimate that 99.3 per cent are now phased out, and the government will continue to work with industry along with the states and territories in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do believe at this stage that seeking cooperation and collaboration is the appropriate way to be able to build upon the gains that have been made and to maintain that goodwill in those discussions, which is why we do not support the amendments as you've put them forward. I should also thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson, for your acknowledgment of the work of Mr Evans and some of the engagement undertaken in your remarks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You asked a question in particular about the European Union's directive, Senator Whish-Wilson. I don't have details around that directive before me tonight. I am, in broad terms, aware of its existence and aspects of it and also that the nature of our parliament passing a law and its application across the country, if passed into law, is sometimes a little different to any new directive and the extent to which the 27 member states at various times or places pass those directive into law in their own different procedures and practices. I don't, as I say, have the details here, but, whilst opposing your amendments, I do acknowledge the good progress being made by many states and certainly commit that the Commonwealth, where we can, will continue to work collaboratively with states to help them on this journey.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:05</span>):  Yes, I acknowledge the obviously different parliamentary structures. However, I think we all agree that Australia is a nation girt by sea and, very broadly, we are an ocean-loving community. People who live near the coast and even those who live inland love their oceans and take these issues very seriously. I would remind the Senate that these amendments are based on European legislation which was primarily aimed at helping to reduce the impact of marine plastic pollution, but it also is recognised by the recycling industry. In fact, one of APCO's voluntary targets is to phase out problematic single-use plastics. Why? Because they can't be recycled. There is talk of different techniques for potentially recycling these plastics, but everybody knows they're problematic. They cause problems in the sorting process and they go to landfill. They need to go. Everybody seems to recognise that we need to do something about this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was particularly interested in the government's response to this because, as I mentioned in my contribution to the second reading debate, the Prime Minister went to New York to address the UN General Assembly, where he said Australia was going to lead on this issue. Yet, what I see from the European Parliament is leadership on reducing single-use plastics. Minister, I noticed in your contribution and in many contributions by Liberal senators that you talk about plans, lots of plans, to complement what we have here today. The problem is twofold. We haven't seen the detail of your plans such as your plastics plan, and plans aren't legislated. They are not necessarily going to be enforceable. I think we all agree that they're policies that will live or die at the whim of a government, no matter who is in government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recycling industry and others are saying that they want to see legislative certainty. They want us to get the settings right. They need that certainty to invest, to move us to a circular economy, to move us out of the waste crisis. Of course, those many millions of Australians who care about the impact of marine debris and marine plastic pollution on our marine life want to see this done. Minister, why haven't you released your plastics plan? When will you release your plastics plan and will there be a comprehensive strategy in your plastics plan to phase out problematic single-use plastics?</span>

In response to that, I would point out that, at the time the Prime Minister made those remarks, he had a plan to ban the export of waste. Tonight the parliament is considering legislation that gives effect to that plan, and so I would contend that leadership is clearly being displayed in implementing and working towards the plans that our government has developed to be world-leading in terms of restricting the export of waste. I also note that, in this sense, commensurate with our federation and consistent with it, we as a national government have taken leadership in the areas of our obvious responsibility—that is, how we engage with the rest of the world—and we have said very clearly that the exporting of waste is not something that Australia should do. It's inconsistent with the commitments that we think we make to the rest of the world, and particularly to our region, and that's why we as a national government are applying the ban and the commensurate steps to be able to deal with the flow-on impacts of that.</span>

It is about supporting their autonomy in a federation and also encouraging that leadership.</span>

I'm advised that consultation around the draft plan will be able to commence around Q1 next year or thereabouts and that we should be in a strong position to then be able to progress the implementation of that, just as right now we are implementing the waste export ban that we had previously announced.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:11</span>):  As someone who does care deeply about this issue and has genuinely campaigned to reduce plastic pollution in oceans for nearly 15 years in and out of this place, I can tell you it was absolutely clear the Prime Minister first said in a press conference in Sydney that his daughter had asked him to take on this issue, because schoolkids, children, care about this. They wanted him to act. He very clearly said at the UN that he would address the issue of plastic pollution in the ocean. I ask any minister to tell me how this legislation tonight reduces plastic pollution in the ocean. I'm not being facetious or not genuine in any way about what I'm saying, but a waste export ban bans the export of waste, and the Greens support that. I like the idea that we can deal with this issue ourselves in this country; we shouldn't be sending low-grade waste, particularly if it's contaminated, to where it's out of mind, out of sight. I like the idea, but how are these bills going to tackle the issue of marine plastic pollution? They exclude plastic packaging, and I would say they deliberately exclude plastic packaging.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do recognise what you said in your contribution, Minister—that APCO are going to seek to apply to become an accredited product stewardship scheme under the act, once the bills pass. That's great; I'll talk to Minister Evans about that. It was raised in the Senate inquiries, and I was glad that APCO said they were agnostic about that. I was glad when the Food and Grocery Council said that they would support that. So it's great that they're going to become an accredited product stewardship scheme, but it's voluntary. I don't need to remind the Senate of the fact that APCO have never met their targets; they've always fallen way short under the NEPM—under that alternative structure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I once again tonight recognise that I do believe APCO are doing things differently. They are genuinely saying that they're pulling their socks up, but the problem is the recycling industry just don't agree with that. They have seen this problem going on for too long, and they want it addressed. Where does a ban on exports of plastic waste intersect with acting on plastic pollution in the ocean? It could actually make plastic pollution worse. If we go down the road, as outlined in Senator Hanson-Young's second reader amendment, to just burning this stuff for energy, do you know what that's going to do?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's put aside all the arguments for and against incineration of plastic—the arguments around efficiency, toxic emissions and CO2. The problem is that, if you continue to go down this road of the lowest common denominator—and, on the waste hierarchy, waste to energy is just slightly above waste going to landfill—you are going to produce more plastic and consume more plastic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that plastic consumption, especially single-use plastic, is highly correlated with litter. That's the problem we have got with our oceans. Some of the plastics in our oceans come from maritime sources but the majority come from land based sources—from rivers, beaches, parks, landfill and a whole range of sources. If we don't change the way we consume and the way we produce and if we don't redesign for a circular economy then we're never going to solve this problem. This waste ban could be even worse if we don't have the architecture in place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I argue that a ban on the most dangerous single-use plastics, which already have alternatives and which the Australian people want to see, is very sensible. Either way we're giving everyone three years to work with the states to go through that process, which I agree is very important. Senator McAllister raised it. Yes, we need to work with the states. Western Australia even said in their statement that they want to see federal leadership on this. We're all heading in the same direction. Here's an opportunity tonight to legislate that. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got three years to work through it. We'll at least have given the Australian people some certainty that this is going to happen. The federal government has shown leadership on what I argue—putting climate change aside—is the biggest pollution issue on this planet. We all have to play our part. We all have to do our bit. Plastic is through the oceans. It's a scourge. There's a toxic tide of this stuff. It's all through our food chain. It's through everything.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to start acting right now. Tonight the chamber has a chance to do that. I urge all senators to support these amendments. You won't be surprised to know that, if we don't successfully get these amendments up tonight, we won't be giving up, because I don't think the Australian people would find that acceptable. Minister, you seem to be not in a position to provide any detail around your plastics plan, but I greatly anticipate its release. I hope you have some very detailed and comprehensive strategies for phasing out single-use plastics. We'll continue the debate after that. I commend these amendments to the chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the second group of substantive amendments I'll move tonight, following the ones we've just dealt with, which were for a ban on single-use plastics. I'm very sad that wasn't supported by the Senate tonight, but we won't be giving up. I would also mention again to the Senate that we've pulled an amendment on sheet 1029. That will not be moved tonight. That's off the menu. The reason we've pulled it is that we had some very constructive discussions with senators from Labor and other parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're doing in these amendments is very simple and straightforward. APCO, the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation, are very confident they're going to meet the targets of their voluntary schemes. They've provided that evidence to two Senate inquiries. Their key stakeholders, the Food and Grocery Council, said they were going to meet their targets, Woolworths said they were going to meet their targets and Amcor said they were going to meet their targets. They're very confident. So we said: 'Great. If you can talk the talk then you won't mind walking the walk.' Tonight we're simply going to take what's already in existence and mandate by 2025 targets that are currently voluntary, so that when you walk into a supermarket 100 per cent of all packaging will be either recyclable or compostable, and 30 per cent of that packaging will be made from recycled product.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this is absolutely critical to the recycling industry in Australia. If they had confidence that APCO were going to meet their targets we wouldn't need a mandatory product stewardship scheme as is before the chamber tonight. That allows them to invest, increase their recyclate—take plastics as an example—and know there will be a readily available market for that plastic because, in law in this country, 30 per cent of that packaging is going to have to be made from already recycled material. That's very important to the waste management associations. Their evidence was very clear. Rose Reid and Gayle Sloan spoke at two Senate inquiries and were very up-front that they wanted a mandatory product stewardship scheme. In other words, they wanted the policy certainty that their industry could invest the money and get on with the job. And that means Australian jobs. It means tens of thousands of Australian jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators don't necessarily know how potentially jobs-rich the recycling industry is. In a recent independent report on the recycling industry it was very clear that even just better washing of recycled materials could lead to 20,000 new jobs in this country. The report was from a technology centre in engineering excellence in Sydney. They were looking at the processes necessary to re-engineer products. That report is the only independent assessment of the state of recycling in Australia and of how we can build a circular economy. They're clearly saying that the recycling industry doesn't have policy certainty, and they outline that as one of the key problems with this government's approach. By the way, they're very complimentary of the government's approach in other regards. But they said that their feedback, from speaking to stakeholders, was very clearly that they didn't have the necessary confidence to invest. The recycling industry, across the board, doesn't believe that we have the policy settings right in this legislation, but they do support a mandatory product stewardship scheme for plastic packaging. Remember, they already employ 60,000 Australians, and they're the ones saying there are tens of thousands of new jobs if we get on with building a circular economy, fixing the waste process and looking after the planet. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just reiterate to senators that it's not only these key companies. I was on a fantastic hook-up that was organised by Plastic Oceans with the CEO of Amcor and other stakeholders. The CEO of Amcor, which is the second-biggest packaging company behind Visy, said on the call, and I've got the transcripts, that he supported mandatory product stewardship schemes—not just product stewardship schemes; he used the words 'mandatory product stewardship schemes'. I sometimes wonder why the government just won't do this—why they won't give the recycling industry, local governments, community groups and environment groups the certainty they need that there will finally be a policy framework so we can meet our targets. No more uncertainty—let's get on with it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, Woolworths said in their submission—and they said it while giving evidence, because I asked them very specifically—that there's no difference to their costs in meeting a mandatory scheme versus a voluntary scheme. Because they are taking it so seriously and are getting on with it—they understand this is a significant matter of public interest—it isn't going to cost them any more to have a mandatory scheme. So, in fact, there is no basis at all to this idea that somehow mandating voluntary targets are going to cost businesses more money. There are no prescriptions here about exactly how industry should meet the targets. The Senate, in this legislation, is not saying to industry: 'Here are your targets. This is how you're going to meet them.' It's saying, 'You've got voluntary targets, great. You love them and are talking them up. You don't mind if we put them in law. It's up to you how you meet them. Go away and do it. Fantastic.' We could breathe easy, knowing that, by 2025, we would have finally got on with the job of rebuilding the recycling industry, have a proper circular economy and actually be protecting our planet. That's what this is about. It's a win-win for everyone. The only group, as I said, who have opposed it seem to be a couple of the bigger packaging companies. So I really don't understand why we wouldn't support this tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go through some detail in my last 2½ minutes or so. This, essentially, asks businesses with a turnover of over $5 million to report. No small businesses in the packaging industry will be captured. There are not many small businesses in the packaging industry as it is. There are plenty, by the way, in the recycling industry that want these amendments. Packaging companies with a turnover under $5 million don't have to report to the minister. The minister, when he receives reports for those businesses with turnovers of over $5 million, can look at them. If he sees that there's a problem with them meeting their targets, he can then ask for a 'please explain'. He can then go to the process of providing a direction. If they don't comply with that direction, there's still discretion at that point as to whether the minister will actually put in place the penalties, or enact the penalties, which are in this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is based on the product stewardship scheme that already exists. There's no reinventing of the wheel here. These are very simple but extremely important amendments. If we amend this tonight, and it goes to the House, I would ask the government to consider that we've all done a good job here. We've all done our bit to try and solve the waste crisis, we've all done our bit to create Australian jobs in the recycling industry and we've all done a solid for the oceans. And the Australian people expect that. They're listening and watching tonight. I've never seen an environmental issue as big as plastic in the oceans. It cuts across everything. No-one likes it—it doesn't matter who they are—but everybody wants to do something about it. This one's very simple. I would urge senators to support these amendments. Please, let's hold the packaging industry to account; let's take what they've said they're going to do anyway, put it into law and therefore give the recycling industry the certainty they need to invest in a circular economy.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:35</span>):  Labor supports these amendments. In reflecting on the significance of the proposal before us, it just so happens that I've had a long, professional involvement with the waste and recycling sector. Quite a few years ago, I had the good fortune to work for the New South Wales EPA, where there were some very creative and thoughtful policymakers. It has been a long-held objective to actually get packaging products working in the circular economy. That has been on the agenda for many, many years. It's a decadal project. Of course, when Labor is in government, it's a project that we are keen to pursue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />We have a very strong record on effective reform in the product stewardship space. In government, we delivered the Product Stewardship Act, and these bills continue that trajectory. Labor established the first co-regulatory scheme for computers and televisions, which is a scheme that remains very successful today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was speaking about Labor's support for the Greens amendments before I was interrupted by a senator who called attention to the state of the chamber. I was saying that we have concerns about the lack of progress being made under the voluntary plastic packaging targets for 2025. We agree that the government's overwhelmingly, or perhaps underwhelmingly, hands-off, voluntary approach has not been effective to date. Only 16 per cent of plastic packaging used in Australia is then recycled. The government has pledged a rate of 70 per cent by 2025. How can we possibly be satisfied that this will happen if we don't change the regulatory framework that has so far and for so long allowed the recycling rates of plastics to remain appallingly low?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in line with the views of the waste and recycling industry, we support a stronger approach, one that would see improved recycling outcomes for packaging by ensuring that the agreed Australian Packaging Covenant targets, which are already in the National Waste Policy Action Plan, have a mechanism in place through which they can be achieved. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth noting, as I did in the second reading debate, that the forthcoming ban on the export of plastic waste will not naturally result in a serious lift in recycling and remanufacturing unless there is greater producer responsibility with respect to design for recycling and reuse, and a commitment to the incorporation of recycled content, and that is what the scheme would achieve. This is critical to realising not only the environmental outcomes that we're looking for but also the new jobs and the economic activity that would come through establishing a proper recycling industry.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance, Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:40</span>):  The government doesn't support these amendments. There are a number of existing processes that are occurring at present, and we think it would be prudent to enable those processes to run and assess progress at a future point, rather than impose another process on or expectation of industry. Some of the steps from industry at present in relation to packaging and some of the regulatory frameworks that already exist at the state and indeed Commonwealth levels are seeing real progress, and we're concerned that another layer will not necessarily be helpful at this point in time. We see that the APCO are working to implement the 2025 national packaging targets—as acknowledged, I think, by Senator Whish-Wilson—which will see 70 per cent of plastic packaging being recycled or composted by 2025, and working to gain government accreditation for their packaging product stewardship scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has already put in place a legislative framework focused on packaging via the National Environment Protection (Used Packaging Materials) Measure 2011, which I understand will be reviewed over the next 12 months, providing further opportunity. We have of course already discussed the role of the states and territories in phasing out problematic plastics, and the Commonwealth's willingness to play a supportive and coordinating role in that regard—as we've discussed the role that the national plastics plan will play in the development of various measures and initiatives to reduce plastic pollution at every stage of the plastic life cycle. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also concerned, at this rather challenging economic time—coming out of recession—that the additional red-tape requirements for or the costs that could accrue to some 26,000 Australian businesses might not be helpful. It is better to push and encourage the types of processes underway to be fully implemented than for iconic local food-manufacturing and food-processing businesses like Bundaberg, Coopers Brewery or Beechworth Honey potentially to face additional cost pressures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So at this stage the government is not inclined to support these Greens amendments but certainly, through the different steps that are underway, expects to be held to account in relation to seeing a continuing decline in the use of single-use plastics and greater responsibility in the management of plastics. I note Senator Whish-Wilson's opening remarks and I acknowledge he is nothing but persistent in relation to such matters, so I anticipate fully that, as we work through the implementation and development of that national plastics plan, we will certainly face further engagement and scrutiny from the Greens on those matters, and we welcome the opportunity to be able to outline the next steps in the progress that will be being made.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:44</span>):  I've just got one word for this notion that somehow this is going to add an extra process or cost to what's already in existence. I'm going to choose this word very carefully: bunkum. Okay? Baloney—okay, two words. We went through this ad nauseam in the inquiry. We are simply taking the existing voluntary process—no changes to that—and saying, 'Keep going, but we're going to mandate your targets.' That's it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are no additional processes for business and no additional costs. They admitted that in a Senate inquiry. They're doing this anyway. Senator Birmingham said in his last contribution that APCO, the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation, are applying to become a voluntary accredited product stewardship scheme under the act. They are going through this anyway. There are no additional costs. Let me tell you what there are: there are penalties if they don't meet their targets in 2025 if the minister at the time chooses to go down that road. But the incentive is there, and it's very clear. The Australian people and the recycling industry expect you to meet your targets this time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just a quick reminder: in 2005, the previous iteration of the Packaging Covenant set themselves a five-year target for 2010 of 30 per cent of all plastic materials being recycled—30 per cent of all packaging. As Senator McAllister said in her contribution, in 2020 it's 16 per cent, only about half of their 2010 target. While I accept APCO are a different iteration and a different group now and they're getting on with it, it's not acceptable to the recycling industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want the jobs and we want the investment, we really need to put aside this fear campaign about extra costs. There won't be any. But there will be consequences if the industry are greenwashing and full of spin and no-one's going to be there to hold them to account. APCO and the packaging industry have never been penalised for their dismal failure—by the way, a dismal failure which APCO themselves were open and honest about in the Senate inquiries that talked about this. APCO's CEO was very clear that they had failed. There was no doubt about that. They said, 'Trust us; we're different.' I'm not going to criticise them at this point, but I can tell you the stakeholders in the recycling industry aren't confident that that is the case. They want the certainty, and they want it tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I just would say to senators once again: we have the opportunity here to put up a very significant amendment that is actually very simple and very effective and will go a long way to helping fix the waste crisis. It is one of the biggest employers in this country: 60,000 Australians for one industry. That could be a whole lot larger. It's what they want. Let's give it to them. Let's get out of the waste crisis. Let's build a circular economy where everything has a value, everything's set up for the end of its life and everything's designed. Enormous innovation potential could be going into this, with research and development and green jobs. Let's vote on it tonight. I commend these amendments to the Senate.</span>

                    </a>  No, I don't need to call a quorum, but I'm really disappointed that we had a chance—I want to thank the Labor Party for supporting the amendment. Senator McAllister said that they understand how important jobs are, especially in rural and regional Australia. The recycling industry is a huge employer. It's a shame that One Nation don't know the value of jobs in rural and regional areas. They have turned their backs again on the battlers in these areas and on the industries that are going to employ them. Recycling in many cases will employ low-skilled labour, but there's huge demand for low-skilled labour.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the original legislation in 2011, when the Product Stewardship Act went through, it was considered important to have a group of eminent experts and very important stakeholders who could advise the government around its product stewardship schemes and its Product Stewardship Act. While I accept the government has a very good initiative in place with the Product Stewardship Centre of Excellence, which is an initiative by the government, which will look at how to constantly improve product stewardship schemes and how to make them work. It doesn't matter what kind of waste product or waste stream we're talking about, it could be computers, e-waste—Mr Temporary Chair, could you perhaps ask some of the senators to leave the chamber?</span>

It could be wind turbines, as Senator Roberts raised in his fantastic contribution. It doesn't matter what kind of product stewardship scheme we're talking about, the centre of excellence, I do believe from what I've heard from speaking to very informed and experienced stakeholders, is a good initiative, and I applaud the government for that. However, the advisory group is independent. It has key and eminent stakeholders. And, while this Senate removed the advisory group from the Product Stewardship Act as part of this government's war on green and red tape, I stood up in the Senate chamber—in fact, it was two Christmases ago, I remember, exactly this week, the night of our Christmas party—and I argued: 'We shouldn't remove this advisory group. They play a very important role in working with government and making sure that product stewardship schemes are independently assessed and that they have that kind of external advice which is important to the department.' So I commend these amendments to the Senate.</span>

Senator Whish-Wilson approached me this morning to discuss his amendments, especially on sheet 1134. I invited him into my office straightaway. We made arrangements. We spent a good deal of time listening to him, and there is some merit in some of the details in his amendments. We also then took a responsible position and invited the government to respond, and we asked them questions. We genuinely analysed and considered and reviewed both positions. In the end, we believe that the Greens amendments will add additional burdens that are not worthy of consideration because they will put an additional 26,000 businesses under enormous paperwork loads, and some retailers, small business people, are already burning the midnight oil. That will hurt small companies and hurt retailers. We also learned that there is a consultative process underway with the government involving state governments and other entities in this country. We will wait for that happen and let it happen properly, and then we'll assess that on its merits. We will let that consultative process continue.</span>

I won't disclose the details of our conversation this morning. May I say One Nation have had these amendments for nearly two months. We've been speaking to their office for many, many weeks, as have a number of stakeholders, speaking to their excellent advisers, who I believe supported these amendments. I don't know what your reason was, Senator Roberts, for turning your back on the recycling industry tonight and the 60,000 Australians it employs, but I hope they note your excuse that you've just given for not supporting this, that somehow you've bought the packaging industry lies and disinformation that this is going to add extra costs to business. I was very clear that industry themselves said it wouldn't. It excludes small businesses, and I went through that with you ad nauseam this morning, Senator Roberts. It's clear you've made up your mind: you've chosen to side with the big packaging companies and with the government. You've turned your back on it, and now you're trying to make excuses and work your way through. There is no evidence at all that this is going to add to the costs. We're taking an existing process and mandating it—that's all we're doing. I don't know how many times I have to explain it to you, but I'm sure no matter how many times I do it's not going to sink in. That's all I have to say.</span>

When we consult with people and when we want to influence people, when they disagree with us we don't get upset. We just accept that that they have a view and we respect that view. We know that small businesses will end up with huge, massive paperwork loads. We're not willing to have that. There are many other flaws in this. There are some points of merit, as I said, but, on balance, we are not going to support Senator Whish-Wilson's amendments. We just didn't.</span>

The government's view is that this amendment is unnecessary and duplicative, in the sense that the government has already provided amendments to recognise the advisory role of the newly announced Product Stewardship Centre of Excellence. This Product Stewardship Centre of Excellence, supported with $1 million, will play a key role in driving Australia's circular economy towards an 80 per cent recovery rate across all waste streams by 2030. The new export body will provide mentoring and best-practice guidance to both new and expanding product stewardship schemes. I understand the centre of excellence will be housed or coordinated by the University of Technology Sydney, and clearly it will provide the type of independent, excellent advice that is appropriate in these circumstances.</span>

Certainly under the product stewardship arrangements that Labor put in place in 2011 there was an independent statutory body in the form of the Product Stewardship Advisory Group, and it was taken away by the Abbott government, which, not unlike this government, had a general aversion to independent advice and oversight. While Labor was successful in getting the government to strengthen consultation through amendments made in the other place—for example, by inserting a requirement that the minister must consult with states and territories and also with the soon-to-be-formed Product Stewardship Centre of Excellence—we consider that there is real merit in the proposal before us. There's little doubt that an independent statutory advisory group would be a better and stronger source of input and assessment.</span>

The problem is: when you're talking about education programs, how do you fund them? These amendments are fairly straightforward. They require certain members of the Packaging Covenant, or potentially a new iteration if it falls under this legislation as a voluntary product stewardship scheme, to make financial contributions to help pay for raising that education and awareness. These amendments are fairly straightforward and I commend them to the Senate.</span>

We believe producers should be held responsible for ensuring that the products they manufacture can be recycled, and producers should be expected to shift towards circular and sustainable use of materials. That is how we will achieve better outcomes for waste and recycling, and that means better environmental outcomes, less resource depletion and new manufacturing opportunities. However, without any expert analysis of the impacts and the benefits for plans such as those proposed in these amendments, Labor can't support these amendments. It's not really clear that this is the best way of achieving the change that's intended, and there has not been sufficient engagement with producers and other stakeholders.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are essentially on stronger labelling. These amendments propose labelling requirements for certain plastic products to alert consumers to the potential harm of the product to the environment. These are required by January 2022—so in a couple of years time. The packaging of the following products must state that the product is harmful to the environment if released or incorrectly disposed of: sanitary products, wet wipes, balloons and cigarette filters.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the single-use plastics ban, the biggest criticism I got tonight for putting up the ban on single-use plastics—the amendments which, sadly, were voted down—was that it didn't go anywhere near far enough. This was from people that have been campaigning in this area for decades. For example, they wanted a ban on single-use plastics to include helium balloons. They wanted cigarette filters banned. For those people who don't know, cigarette filters are plastic. If you put them in water and you leave them for a few months and come back, you'll see the water is full of plastic filaments. Of course, cigarette butts are the most common item that we find on our beaches in Australia. They make their way into the water. It doesn't take them long to decompose, and then you have millions, if not billions, of pieces of microplastic in the ocean from cigarette filters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Filters are something we would have loved to have banned, but we knew that was going to be very problematic. We wanted to stick to items that had readily available alternatives that people could use; that doesn't disadvantage business. But we did want to at least have stronger labelling that lets consumers know that when they buy balloons or cigarettes, these things, if not disposed of properly, will be extremely harmful in the ocean. While we've worked on balloon releases—we know that it's becoming very politically incorrect to release balloons at public events. Sadly, there are still balloons being released at some events, but most people understand now that they go straight into the ocean. Every balloon you saw in the old days at the MCG was going straight into Port Phillip Bay or even further in the ocean. At least we've cracked down on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the best we can do without going too far. That's not something you'd normally hear from me or from the Greens, but this is our version of compromising. I suppose what I'm saying to the Senate is: it's not a big deal but it's important, so please support it.</span>

When it comes to lifting waste and recycling, as I've made clear all through this evening, the current labelling regime falls a long way short of what's required. But this is a complex issue, and it can't be fixed by forcing plastic manufacturers to apply some form of warning message on their product that risks further complicating a current mess of labelling features. Poor product design—and it is about design—means that, for some packaging, only certain elements of the product are recyclable. That forces us to use very complicated labelling that makes it very difficult for consumers to understand what they are supposed to do with the product in their hand—a conversation I have with my family on a very regular basis. We would like to see a comprehensive review of label packaging. We think that's necessary to determine what kind of reform would be sensible and effective. We call on the government to undertake a full review of product labelling that would drive change through consumer choice and greater transparency, increase proper sorting and disposal, and allow responsible producers to be recognised for making sustainable product decisions.</span>

Industry has delivered strong uptake of the Australasian Recycling Label. Over 400 APCO members are now committed to its use, and those numbers continue to grow. As I've noted before in this debate, industry has also delivered on phasing out microbeads, with 99.3 per cent of use now phased out. For these reasons we don't support these amendments by the Greens, which would apply regulation onto industry when, in fact, government working cooperatively with industry is already achieving significant outcomes.</span>

Funnily enough, the aspects of this legislation that deal with the product stewardship scheme are very similar to the 2011 scheme that was brought in by Labor. There's a bit of fiddling around the edges and some rejigging. There's not a lot that is new there, but one thing that is new is a priority list. The minister can add a packaging stream, like plastic, to the priority list.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments put plastic packaging on the next priority list. So, once this legislation is passed tonight, the minister can go through a process where they can put any packaging stream on a priority list. When it's on a priority list, what is different about it is that the minister can name and shame an organisation, a company or a member of the Packaging Covenant for not meeting their targets. Right now, I'd rather see a mandatory scheme that provides penalties for businesses that don't meet targets. But this allows the minister to stand up in parliament, under quite restrictive conditions, may I say, and name and shame a business that doesn't do the right thing. There are a number of free riders in the packaging industry. That's why they've never come anywhere close to achieving their targets. There are a lot of businesses that actually need a bit of a gee-up. This allows the minister to put them on a priority list, which essentially puts them on notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's pretty straightforward. We want to mandate tonight having plastic packaging put on that priority list. It's kind of a halfway house between a voluntary scheme and a mandatory scheme. It says, 'You're applying for voluntary product stewardship accreditation, but you're on the priority list now. You've got 12 months to show some progress; otherwise, the minister can go into the chamber and name the companies that are free-riding and causing problems.' I ask the Senate to support this simple, logical motion that helps to fix the problem.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:40</span>):  Labor supports these amendments. In relation to amendment (1), we moved a similar amendment, in fact, in the other place. It's a shame that the government didn't support it over there and we hope that they will support it here. To give an example of how little has been achieved when it comes to waste outcomes for packaging, at present the recycling rate for plastic packaging is only 16 per cent. Without further regulatory action, it is pretty difficult to see how the government's target of 70 per cent by 2025 could possibly be achieved. We are a month away from it being 2021 and we should stop kidding ourselves about the lack of progress. Amendment (2) basically requires the statutory review of this act to be undertaken by an independent body rather than the department. This is very sensible. The statutory review of the Product Stewardship Act, which was due in 2016, wasn't delivered until this year. It's plain that we need an independent body to engage in this task.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  I'll use the adjournment time allotted to address a few concerns that I've had for a long time. They're challenged in this chamber almost every day, particularly by the members of the Australian Greens. I want to put on the record something which you'd be very familiar with, Mr Acting Deputy President Brockman, and that is the contribution of the mining sector to the Australian economy and the contribution of the mining sector in particular to monetary amounts and the contribution to employment in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do know, from our good friends at the Parliamentary Library, that iron ore and concentrates exports were worth $102.7 billion in 2019-20 and accounted for 26.9 per cent of the total value of Australia's merchandise exports. We know, once again from the information from our good friends at the Parliamentary Library, that coal exports were worth $54.6 billion in 2019-20 and accounted for 14.3 per cent of the total value of merchandise exports. And we know that natural gas exports were worth $47.5 billion and accounted for 12.4 per cent of the total value of merchandise exports. Those things cumulatively add up to a significant chunk of the nation's exports and earnings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the Parliamentary Library—because you ask the question and they diligently provide the answer—that there are significant numbers of people employed in each one of those sectors, and those discrete numbers add up to really high employment figures right around the country. As the mining sector has changed and become fly-in fly-out or drive-in drive-out, people don't actually live around the Surat Basin or the Pilbara or the other gas exploration areas, so we know that each and every electorate in this country comprises people who, either through mining and energy or through technological services to the mining industry, earn their bread and butter, feed their families, educate their children and pay their mortgages through that connection with the very vital mining sector. This is not rocket science.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I hear people say, 'dirty coal' or, 'Let's get rid of coal,' or, 'Gas is too expensive,' or, 'Gas is burning the planet,' I don't really understand what the people who advocate those positions are saying to the people in the sector. In the absence of any grand plan, I think they're threatening their employment opportunities and threatening their livelihoods, and they will take the appropriate action: they won't vote for you. It's fine to be a member of the Greens political party, because I'm certain that their motto should be—to channel Whitlam's 1967 speech—'Certainly, the impotent are pure.' You can be ideologically pure but you'll never have to make a decision. You'll never have to have the honest approach to government where you have to make difficult decisions. You can be in opposition forever, and I compliment the Greens on their strident advocacy for never being in government because they should never be allowed anywhere near the wheels of government. Certainly, their ideology will continue to make them impotent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got to get to an Australia where it's not adversarial—save the planet, ditch the worker. If the market is what I believe it is, a successful capitalist market will make prudent decisions based on investment, on technology and on what's coming down the pipeline. The argument's fairly clear, with ageing power infrastructure. Why would you invest in an ageing power plant powered by coal if you can get away with a switch-on switch-off gas opportunity? If it's dearer, someone's got to pay for that. We know with renewable technology that when the wind stops blowing and the sun stops shining you've got to crank something up quickly. Coal is probably a bit too slow for that. The batteries are not there yet. Gas is. Gas is turn on, turn off—and it's significantly more expensive than coal. I accept the market will make decisions like that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we can't tell people engaged in industries which are vital to Australia's economic prosperity that we don't care about them, that we don't value their contribution. If we do tell people that, then we're never going to get elected. The Labor Party is never going to get elected. We need to have a strategy for the people in the Hunter Valley, the Surat Basin and the Pilbara. People don't live in just those areas; they live all over Australia. If we're going to be a party which is closer to the Greens than I would like, I want it on the record here tonight that I don't support that. I support climate change. I'm not a denier, but I'm not about throwing out a livelihood in which people have worked hard, from which they've fed families, in which they've earned good money and through which they've contributed well to the economy, because of some Kyoto protocol or whatever. This has got to be pragmatically and carefully worked through. I can be labelled a heretic on my side—I'm not really fussed about that—but I'm not going to endure in this place notices of motion calling on climate emergencies which threaten the livelihoods of 650,000 Australians involved in mining and mining services in this country. I'm not going to stand by and let that go through to the keeper. I'm going to oppose it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think you can do a number of things very well in this country. You can manage your attitude towards climate change and you can manage your income and your attitude towards mining and mining services, because we've done it for a century or more. No-one wants to destroy the environment, but we do have to have economic prosperity. I think I even agreed with Senator Roberts that if you haven't got an economic system that delivers prosperity you're not in a position to make any decision. You're usually begging. We are prosperous. We are smart. The Chief Scientist is on the ball. He recommends a way forward. Other people are saying, 'No, no, it's all got to be one way.' It hasn't all got to be one way. Government is really difficult. To those who want to be ideologically pure: don't go into government. There are tough decisions in this space that can and should be made, and I for one want it on the record here that, whilst I'm not a climate change denier, I'm certainly not walking away from the mining industry. I think it's delivered very well for this country. It's underpinned the prosperity of regions, states and the entire country. Every time I see one of these notices of motion encouraging us to throw people under a bus, I get pretty angry about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to take that few minutes tonight to say that. I also wanted to put on the record that I try and actually drill down. I know I come from the state with the highest level of renewable energy—solar, wind and the like; solar on the roof. But I also know this: I just built a new house, and with $6,000 I can put a respectable amount of kilowatts on my roof and diminish my bill. But the pensioner on my street can't do that. They're paying a higher infrastructure charge. The government is spending a billion dollars a year subsidising solar, which is wonderful. But what about the people who can't afford those panels? What about the people who are paying higher infrastructure charges because they have no option? I've got an app on my phone. It tells me my house costs $3.50 a day to run. My house is brand new, it's insulated and it's well built. It's the latest green you-beaut design and it costs $3 or $4 a day. There are pensioners in my street who are paying much more than that because their houses are not well built. They're not built for the climate, they're not insulated and yet we go out and subsidise wealthy people like me to put solar on their roof. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I drill down into this and I get quite angry at times. We are all wedded to saving the planet, but there seem to be some pretty obvious gaps in all of this. What are we going to do for the workers in sections of the economy that people threaten? Threatening people will guarantee one reaction: they won't vote for you. If you're not clear on your strategy going forward, I suggest you don't advocate it. And if you have a strategy going forward, it's got to include a transition plan. I've not heard about a transition plan. You just say, 'Coal is going to disappear.' That's a lot of crap; the coal industry had $47 billion last year in exports. A million tonnes of coal go out of Port Waratah on trains and there are people repairing those trains. In conclusion, I want to put this on the record because I am pragmatic about this space.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:00</span>):  Online dating apps have changed how an entire generation meets and how they connect with each other. Dating apps like Tinder and Bumble have become part of young people's lives. They allow them to meet people in their area who share their interests in a way that is convenient, accessible and affordable. These platforms have had a transformative impact on our lives, and for the most part this transformation has been emphatically positive. But like most platforms they also impose harms on the community. Those harms have taken time to become obvious, and it is taking longer for regulators and law enforcement agencies to adapt to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dating apps have also proven to be a useful mean for predators to target young people and to commit a range of offences known as 'technology facilitated sexual violence'. A number of recent cases demonstrate what is meant by this. The most shocking is that of a 13-year-old girl who was in the care of the South Australian Minister for Child Protection. This girl was a user of the MyLOL dating app, which is aimed at teens, and she was targeted by a 35-year-old paedophile. She was impregnated and subsequently underwent a termination. Despite the heinous offence committed against someone in the state's care, the minister was not even aware of the case until a guilty verdict was returned in August this year. I contacted the minister three months ago seeking information about what action she would be taking to protect other minors in the state's care, and incredibly this correspondence has gone unanswered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another case relates to a 56-year-old man whose body was found in February this year. The body was found bound and abandoned in bushland near Batemans Bay. Police have alleged that the man arranged a meeting with a 17-year-old through the Grindr app. Whilst the circumstances remain unclear, the 17-year-old, along with two others, has been charged with the man's murder. A third case relates to a Melbourne man known as the 'Tinder rapist'. This man used Tinder and other apps to arrange meetings with his victims before committing acts of sexual violence against them. Incredibly, the man continued using Tinder even after he was charged with sexual assault. He was able to set up multiple accounts using fake names and continued to try to lure women. The man subsequently pleaded guilty and received a sentence of 14 years and nine months. He has shown no remorse for his actions or for the trauma he caused his victims, and tragically one of his victims took her own life before the man was sentenced. The judge presiding over the case said the online world 'provides a fertile landscape where predators can roam'. These cases demonstrate the truth of that claim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key point here is that the apps don't recognise they have any duty of care to protect their users from predators—no duty of care. An investigation by the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Hack</span> programs revealed that apps like Tinder often failed to act on user complaints. When complaints are made, users often receive little more than an automated response. It is not clear whether the platforms actively investigate complaints, whether they take action to block users who are accused of wrongdoing or even whether they report wrongdoing to police and other agencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The investigation also revealed that police and other agencies struggle to make contact with these apps in the course of an investigation, which is simply unacceptable. It could be argued that such apps even facilitate predatory behaviour. With lax registration requirements and features like Tinder's 'unmatch' facility, which completely erases the message history between users, effectively a predator can register on Tinder with nothing more than an email address and a burner phone. Once they have committed an offence, they can unmatch with the victim and it becomes virtually impossible for police to trace the offender.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, every business providing financial services is required to comply with know-your-customer obligations. Platforms like Tinder should be subject to similar obligations so that perpetrators can be easily identified when an offence is committed. Every platform should also offer a simple way for law enforcement agencies to contact them and access information about users, including their message histories. Simply publicising a basic level of cooperation could be enough to deter many predators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, the Australian Institute of Criminology published a report into dating apps and violent offending. Although dating apps facilitate only a small proportion of sexual assaults, it is clear that users of these apps have a greater risk of victimisation than non-users. That report noted research which found that around half of all dating app users had experienced some form of harassment—over half!—and such experiences were even more common among LGBTIQ+ users. It is not clear whether the app developers are aware of these experiences. If they are, it does not appear they are taking action to clean up the behaviours of users. Few apps publish safety guidelines or provide users with information about what constitutes an offence and how they can take action when an offence is actually committed. A user's only recourse is to report wrongdoing in the app and hope that someone actually sees or acts upon the report. As the law currently stands, there is no legal obligation for these apps to remove or block sexual or violent offenders from using these platforms. The criminal history of users is not screened. This enables predators, and very much needs to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The businesses which develop and profit from these apps need to be accountable. Their products have facilitated a great number of relationships, friendships and marriages, and developers should rightly feel proud of the good they have achieved, but—and it's a big but—they should also be held accountable for the harms which they have indirectly facilitated. It is unfortunate that businesses have not been proactive in providing greater protections for their users. It is because of this failure that the government needs to step in and protect the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A year ago, the Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts announced the government would legislate a new online safety act that would help to deliver the protections the community expects. The minister said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The internet offers significant economic and social benefits, but these benefits will only be fully realised if Australians can engage confidently and safely in the online world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="text-decoration:none underline;" />I agree with those comments entirely. As part of the announcement, the government circulated a consultation paper, at the end of last year, which included a proposal for basic online safety. This would provide minimum standards for apps and platforms to meet. Although I was unsure whether these expectations would be enough to protect users, I felt it was very much a good start. Incredibly, there has been no action since the consultation closed in February. <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">Admittedly, the pandemic has made it more difficult to consult and to develop policy, but it has also forced more people online more of the time. There is even greater need for these protections to be developed and legislated in the current environment. I urge the government to recognise online safety as a matter of urgency and a legislative priority, and I ask the minister to commit to introducing legislation to this effect in the first sitting of 2021.</span></span>
