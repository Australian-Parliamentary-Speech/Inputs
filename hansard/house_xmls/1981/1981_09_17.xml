       Their anger and condemnation at the Fraser Government's decision to abolish all Community Youth Support Schemes on 31 October 1981.

       Community Youth Support Scheme
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Victoria respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That the serious youth unemployment problem is a direct result of the community's failure to create sufficient jobs.
      </para>
      <para>
       In these circumstances the decision to abolish Community Youth Support Schemes (CYSS) is a socially retrogressive step. The CYSS Projects provide valuable support services and work training for many young unemployed.
      </para>
      <para>
       We the undersigned are concerned that the closure of CYSS Projects may lead young unemployed to become involved in anti-social behaviour such as crime, vandalism, prostitution, rebellious behaviour and mob action. There is the even more frightening prospect that many more young people will give up hope of obtaining a job, become idle and even contemplate suicide.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government reverse its decision to abolish CYSS Projects and provide sufficient funds to enable the various CYSS centres to continue their valuable work with the young unemployed in the future.

      </para>
      <para>
       (i) that the action of the Government in terminating the Community Youth Support Scheme will have serious effects upon the life possibilities of a significant number of young people who, through circumstances totally outside their control, are not able to find any form of paid employment,

      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) that the failure to provide such supports will place many young people in a position of high vulnerability to crime, violence, vandalism, drug abuse, and even suicide, and that the incidence of homelessness and family breakdown will be further aggravated.

       Trans Australia Airlines
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans-Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans-Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.

       Tertiary Education
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. The proposal to introduce fees for higher and second degrees will mean that access to post-graduate and recurrent education will be limited to the rich; Australian research and ability to cope with technological change will suffer; this proposal must be seen as a step in the direction of the introduction of fees for all tertiary students.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. The proposed introduction of a loans scheme for students will mean graduating with a heavy debt or being denied a tertiary education if loans are refused because a student is seen as a ''poor risk'' (particularly affecting women and those doing non-vocational courses); only the rich will be able to get a tertiary education without course restrictions and the burden of indebtedness.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. In regard to the proposal to restrict eligibility for TEAS and the foreshadowing of reviewing TEAS levels only in the light of the availability of loans, it should be noted that any further downgrading of TEAS, which is already inadequate, can only further limit access to education.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. The proposed restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance to those needing qualifications for employment will severely restrict access to a full high school education and necessary bridging education to tertiary education for those who left school early.
      </para>
      <para>
       5. The proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education if they are not rationalised is an attack on teacher education. This attack will create teacher shortages in the mid 1980s, restrict access to education now and endanger the future quality of teaching available to Australian children.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) post-secondary tuition fees not be introduced for any courses or for any category of students;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) that the TEAS scheme be extended so as to more fully meet the real financial needs of students.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) that a comprehensive loans scheme not be introduced.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) that there be no restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance.
      </para>
      <para>
       (v) that the proposal not to fund 30 CAEs unless they are rationalised be rescinded.

      </para>
      <para>
       (i) The financial situation of students enrolled at Australian post-secondary institutions is already extremely difficult (as indicated in the Commonwealth Department of Education's 1979 survey of student incomes and expenditure) and any substantial increase in the financial commitments of students would gravely worsen their financial difficulties.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) The imposition of post-secondary tuition fees of comparable levels to those imposed prior to 1971 would force many currently enrolled students to discontinue their studies and deter many persons willing and able at present to undertake post-secondary study from doing so.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) Those students and potential students from social groups currently under-represented and disadvantaged in the post-secondary education system would be most severely affected by the reintroduction of fees for post-secondary education.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. post-secondary tuition fees not be re-introduced for any courses or for any category of students

       Plant Variety Rights

      </para>
      <para>
       1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.
      </para>

Is one of the Minister's grounds for this proposed application that the BLF, in the industrial field, acts improperly, will not adhere to agreements and cannot be trusted?

         —As I was saying, the kind of action we have seen the BLF take against Costain is typical of the kind of industrial behaviour which has caused so much havoc in Victoria and other States around Australia. Costain has been in touch with me about the action taken by the BLF. I am meeting Costain in Sydney this morning. I take the matter very seriously. The BLF, trying to be smart on what it calls a tit for tat basis, can do so much harm to this company. I expect after the discussions that I have with Costain this morning we will be able to do something to deal with the BLF. I add that there are many companies which necessarily will be named in the papers to be lodged in the court in regard to deregistration. I wonder whether what we have seen from the BLF up to now is a forerunner of what the BLF might attempt to do against all those companies which are prepared to come forward and give evidence in relation to the conduct of that union.

         —The very severe drought that eastern States have suffered over recent months fortunately has diminished although parts of New South Wales currently are still under drought. New South Wales has quite a remarkable story in respect of drought assistance. At one stage during the very severe drought months earlier I had to bait the New South Wales Premier to give any drought assistance at all. All I wanted him to do was to match the generous assistance being given in Queensland for carriage of stock, fodder and water and assistance in the form of carry-on loans to farmers and small business. Mr Wran was not prepared to do that and he took his time in giving any assistance at all. Finally, by some miracle, he produced a $40m drought plan that we have yet to see even today. He said he had $40m to spend on drought assistance. It is interesting to note that in the election campaign in New South Wales, the Premier is claiming that New South Wales spent $70m on drought relief.

Although clearly the privileges of this Parliament cover us from that restriction, it seems to me to be a gross abuse of privilege for Ministers of the Crown, knowing there is a restriction on every other segment of the electronic broadcasting media in dealing with election material, to use the broadcast of this House during Question Time to make statements which are prohibited on every other part of that media. I suggest, sir, that you as Speaker should indicate to the House that on this matter, having regard to the general restrictions which the Parliament has imposed on all other levels of the electronic media, there is a moral obligation on the Parliament, and on Ministers particularly, to comply with the laws which the Parliament insists every other section of the broadcast communication industry has to comply with.

The honourable gentleman will know from earlier indications that have been given in the Parliament since Tony Joyce was shot in November of 1979 that representations to the Zambian Government have been made on a number of occasions. I wrote to President Kaunda on the day on which news of the shooting was received seeking information. Subsequently, the Acting Foreign Minister wrote to his Zambian counterpart to establish the outcome of investigations undertaken by the Zambian authorities. Tony Joyce was a fine man and a credit to his profession. His death was a great loss. We were all concerned, naturally, to know how and why this tragedy occurred. Earlier this year President Kaunda wrote to me personally about the matter. The President pointed out that Zambia was under attack at this time from Rhodesia. As a result Zambian military and security units were deployed to guard economic and strategically important installations throughout the country, working under highly explosive and very difficult conditions. Movement within the country was restricted and under security control. Investigations conducted by Zambia have not identified the individual or individuals responsible for the shooting. There are different accounts of what happened. It seems unlikely, because of the difficulty and uncertain circumstances prevailing at the time, that the issue will ever be fully resolved.

        In his letter to me President Kaunda very sincerely expressed his regret that Tony Joyce, who was merely carrying out his normal duties, was caught up in this unfortunate situation and lost his life on Zambian soil. I spoke to Mrs Joyce at the time of Tony Joyce's death and conveyed the Australian Government's condolences and my deep personal regret. Since I received President Kaunda's letter I have spoken to Mrs Joyce again and conveyed the sentiments expressed by the President. Tony Joyce's death has been a matter of great sorrow for his family and his friends and I am sure that all honourable members would join with me in expressing again our sincere sympathy to Mrs Joyce.

Nevertheless, industrial unrest and duress by some trade unions will very adversely affect industry confidence and the capacity of industry to plan ahead. I must say that the notorious strike record in New South Wales does little to sustain that confidence. It is a matter of fact that Sydney today is the strike capital of Australia. The Premier of New South Wales cannot stand aside from responsibility for that sorry record. New South Wales, under its present Government, is leading the rest of Australia in industrial disputes. In the first five months of this year almost 60 per cent of the working days lost throughout Australia were lost directly in New South Wales. In the recent week the fact that not one tonne of coal was exported from New South Wales is typical--

However, this question specifically dealt with whether any particular State was leading a manufacturing recovery. I would have thought that an answer to such a question would involve a discussion of the statistics of production. What we are getting is a discussion of days lost through strikes, which is a completely extraneous matter to that question.

Has his attention been drawn to Telecom Australia's forecast overall increase in business of 13 per cent during the current year with a planned increase in productivity of 7 per cent? In the circumstances, will staff reductions imposed by Telecom as a result of the Government's restraints and inadequate borrowing levels imposed on Telecom by his Government result in increased delays in providing services, increasing congestion and an increased level of unsatisfied demands for new services? What action does the Government intend to take to overcome these deficiencies which have been caused by his Government's past and present policies?

The extent to which the improved borrowing program of Telecom has enabled it to launch by far the largest capital expenditure program ever undertaken by that organisation needs to be recognised. The amount of money available to the Telecommunications Commission this year is obviously a significant increase on the amount that was available last year. It is an amount which will enable Telecom, by judicious use of its funds, to provide for the reasonable expanding needs of the communications requirements in the telecommunications field throughout the nation. In addition, of course, the Commonwealth will shortly announce the terms and membership of an inquiry into the services of Telecom designed specifically to extend its capacity to provide services by, I hope, utilising the private sector to a greater degree. Certainly it seems that in the inter-connect or the add-on market, where there are many new technological devices capable of facilitating communications, there is a role that the private sector can play. It is my view that with that there will also be a significant increase in Telecom's ability to meet the requirements of the Australian people.

        It is true that there are a few areas where there are either problems in obtaining an early phone connection or in achieving access to a distant exchange because of the volume of traffic. I instance, for example, the Gold Coast, northern New South Wales, the western suburbs of Sydney towards Penrith and the coastal areas of Queensland where Telecom significantly has provided an increase on funds that were provided last year. I believe Telecom should be able both to reduce the necessary time for telephone connections and meet the requirements of the Australian people. I believe there are significant problems in some areas.

Does this restriction exclude the prime tenderer's alternative contractor, which was based in Denmark? Does it also exclude at least two other of the final tenderers on the previous occasion because partial or significant contractors were located in Sweden or other European countries? Will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, have a clearly definitive statement prepared on the sources which will be available and setting out whether the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation area is included, as I understand certain Department of Defence officials are alleging, or whether only firms within the restricted area stated by the Minister in this statement are, in fact, included?

         —If one looks at objective and independent measurements which have recently become available of the level of home ownership, the answer to that question would have to be a resounding no. The research department of the Reserve Bank of Australia has carried out a survey. On occasions the Reserve Bank is not reluctant to disagree publicly with the Government if it thinks it ought to do so. The latest Reserve Bank statistical bulletin for August 1981 contains the results of that survey, which indicate that by 1980 the level of home ownership in Australia had reached 71.6 per cent, having risen from 66.7 per cent in 1976. That figure of 71.6 per cent compares with Canada, 62 per cent; England and Wales, 50.1 per cent; France, 47.1 per cent; Switzerland, 28.5 per cent; Sweden, often invoked with affection on the other side of the House, 38.9 per cent; the United States of America, 64.8 per cent and West Germany, 33.5 per cent. I think those figures indicate that home ownership is very much alive in Australia and doing a great deal better than in the rest of the Western world. Having said that I do not for a moment disguise the difficulty that many Australians are experiencing at the present time as a consequence of higher interest rates so far as their housing repayments are concerned. Without using extravagant language I think it is fair to say that there are some hopeful signs that we have started to turn the corner on the interest rate front. There has been greater activity so far as the sale of Commonwealth bonds in recent days is concerned. Information to be released in the normal fashion by the monetary authorities this afternoon will confirm that.

        I am very pleased to inform the House-I am delighted in fact-that there is no evidence to suggest that the level of home ownership in my home State of New South Wales is any lower than it is anywhere else in Australia. There is a very good reason for that. The authority for that reason is none other than the Premier of New South Wales. Does the House know what he said? The reason for it is very simple. In a speech in 1977 the Premier of New South Wales stated an obvious fact. I agree with him 100 per cent. He stated:

As I understand it the terms of reference cover adequately the types of allegations that have been made so that the royal commissioner is not prejudiced in any way in bringing down his report. I point out in addition that the Victorian Government has mirrored the terms of reference set by the Federal Government even though earlier-I have read this in Press reports-it was seeking to widen the terms of reference. But in point of fact when the matter was put to study by the Victorian Government's own law authorities they were satisfied with the terms of reference that were to be put down by the Commonwealth. At this point of time the Commonwealth and Victoria have mirror terms of reference for the royal commission.

        I make the point also that, whilst I have heard words of comfort from Queensland and New South Wales about co-operation, we have not yet received, as far as I am aware, any confirmation as to what action Queensland will take in respect of the royal commission. We have received nothing from New South Wales either. I expect to receive nothing anyway from New South Wales until after next Saturday when the Premier will probably back off further than he has so far even in terms of co-operation.

         —Mr Speaker, is any work being done anywhere in the Parliament at present, in Standing Orders committees or some other similar reform committee, to change the rules so that we do not have a repetition of the abuse of Question Time that we have witnessed in this chamber today from Government members and Ministers?

          —The honourable gentleman used the term 'abuse of Question Time'. I do not think he is entitled to use that term because the Standing Orders are being complied with. As the honourable gentleman quite correctly observed at the commencement, it is the Standing Orders that require amendment. Therefore I do not regard it as a reflection on me, although it could be so interpreted from the words used by the honourable member for Adelaide. Many of the Standing Orders should be changed. Indeed, the Standing Orders Committee has met and reported to this House, not on this specific issue but on other issues, and the reports of the Standing Orders Committee just have not been dealt with. A number of reforms of the Standing Orders should be bought into account, and one of them is the question of relevancy. A more stringent definition of relevancy may be considered by the Standing Orders Committee.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         While I am on this topic, another matter which disturbs me is that petitions are read at the commencement of the sitting. During anything from five to 12 minutes of petition time there is constant noise and conversation which I think should not occur but under the Standing Orders I have no power to prevent it occurring. A lot of issues should be considered by the Standing Orders Committee. If it were approached on a strictly non-party basis we could have advantage in a reform of the Standing Orders. The period I have been here has demonstrated to me that whoever is in government-during the period I have been here there has been government from both sides of the House-there is always an attitude towards the Standing Orders which relates to the particular position of the person at the time, whether he is on the opposition side or on the government side. It is remarkable how quickly attitudes change with a change from one side of the House to the other.
        </para>
        <para>
         If the honourable gentleman wishes to pursue the matter with his own party and with the representatives of the Standing Orders Committee, I certainly would be glad to hear suggestions from the Opposition in relation to Standing Orders. Likewise, I would be very happy to hear suggestions from the Government. I will at all times stand ready to call a meeting of the Standing Orders Committee for the purpose of considering them.

         —Mr Speaker, I express sympathy for the difficulty of your position because of, firstly, the limitations in the Standing Orders and, secondly, some deficiencies in the general conduct which cannot be provided for under Standing Orders. There is a need, as there is outside in the community, in relation to ethical or proper conduct for people to accept that there are certain standards of obligation. I cannot help contrast what I saw on some recent visits to the House of Commons, where a genuine effort is made to respond to questions with relevant information, with the procedures here. I will refer very quickly to a General Business item I have on the Notice Paper that goes to the very heart of this matter. I say to you, Mr Speaker, seriously that it seems to me that there was a sort of Gilbert and Sullivan quality to the whole atmosphere this morning. It is not a unique experience in this House. Perhaps if we accept this across the chamber on both sides instead of trying to apportion blame we may ultimately add to the dignity of this place by improving the general standards. It became low farce and a rather crude parody.

I believe that there is a need for some tightening of the general procedures in this House and a greater display of dignity. I would be the last to claim that I have been immune from dereliction from time to time in that respect. I am sure that the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), in a moment of weakness, would make a similar confession. Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence because I believe this is an important matter. It is particularly appropriate that we discuss it now. The atmospherics are such that it has come to the fore with the intervention of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) and your own obviously concerned response. Is Question Time to be a serious search for information? We have a problem. Some serious questions were put up on economic matters this week. Responses slid right around them and were totally irrelevant. One finds that some of the commentators on this matter--

        Let me conclude on this, I hope, succinct point. So many of the procedures in this House belong to a much earlier age, perhaps measured in centuries distant from the present time. They are irrelevant in many important respects to the things we have to consider and the way in which our society wishes to proceed. There is, as Laurie Oakes very correctly observed, at least in this respect, a great burden of frustration upon the shoulders of so many intelligent and able members of Parliament who wish to be diligent. The present procedures stand in the way of what could be many instances of valuable productive work. The proposal I have put forward, which is quite comprehensive, is that a joint committee of the Parliament should exhaustively explore the way in which the Parliament functions.

          —In responding quickly to the Leader of the Opposition, let me make this point: Politics enter into this chamber inevitably. The honourable gentlemen, in his search for a change of the rules, cannot search for the elimination of the politics. If we cannot eliminate the politics the next thing to do is give the chamber all the dignity it can have while discussing political issues. I must draw the honourable gentleman's attention to this point: The House of Commons, to which the honourable gentleman referred in an applauding fashion, for over a century has adopted the practice of the continuity of an independent Speaker. I have been pursuing this matter for a long while. I have no doubt that the honourable gentleman ought to consider it very seriously. It certainly would be following a precedent which has proved to be good in the House of Commons. Apart from that, I ought to point out to the honourable gentlemen that from my observation of the House of Commons there are occasions on which the noisiness and the interjections are even worse than they are in this House.

        —On Tuesday, 25 August, during the tributes paid in the House to the late Honourable R. T. Pollard and reported in Hansard at page 683, I used the following words:

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In 1979 a number of us, including Gough Whitlam, Frank Wilkes and Clyde Holding, made strong representations to the Council for the Order of Australia that Reg Pollard should be given the Order of Australia in recognition of his 37 years as a member of parliament and six years as a Minister. I do not think we received even an acknowledgement.
      </para>
      <para>
       I used similar words in a letter published in the Melbourne Age on 1 September. The Official Secretary to the Governor-General, Mr David Smith, has written a letter of complaint to me in which he points out that the representations of Messrs Wilkes, Holding and myself were acknowledged in writing and that of Mr Whitlam was acknowledged orally. He asked me to make a withdrawal in the House. I asked Mr Holding whether he had received an acknowledgement and he said 'No'. That was also my recollection. I checked my office to see whether there was an acknowledgement on my files and was told 'No'. However, Mr Smith is correct and I am wrong. I had neglected to take the acknowledgement to my office in St Albans and put it on file. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports had handed me his acknowledgment and I had mislaid that too, together with the original reply to me. I apologise for inadvertently misleading the House. However, Mr Smith's letter does not touch on the major point made in my reference, namely, why it was that Mr Pollard's 37 years as a member of parliament and six years as a minister were not considered worthy of recognition.

       (a) notes that the resumed Tenth Session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea decided on 28 August 1981 that the next (Eleventh) Session of the Conference, to be held from 8 March to 30 April 1982, is intended to take final decisions on the provisions of the text, so that a Convention can be opened for signature at Caracas, Venezuela, later that year; and also notes that the United States review of its Law of the Sea policies will soon be completed;

       (b) reaffirms its commitment to the basic objectives of the Conference in working for the conclusion of a comprehensive and widely-accepted Convention on the Law of the Sea which would lay down a balanced and equitable regime, both for the use of the seas by all people for all legitimate purposes, and for the management and use of the resources of the seas and the seabed;

      </para>
      <para>
       For some time I have had a motion on the Notice Paper relating to the law of the sea. As a result of some discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) it has been agreed that this House will consider a further motion which is an amendment to the one originally proposed by me. It reaffirms our commitment to the basic objectives of the law of the sea and it emphasises Australia's vital interests in having an early conclusion to those negotiations. Most importantly, it expresses the hope that the United States will decide to join with the rest of the international community in working to a successful conclusion of the work of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea at its eleventh session. At the outset might I thank the Minister for agreeing to the terms of this today and also for the constructive attitude that he has taken in respect of this matter. I appreciate it. It is very pleasing that there can be a bipartisan approach to matters that are very significant to Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       I remind the House and those who are interested in this matter that the current law of the sea negotiations represent the greatest attempt at international co-operation since the founding of the United Nations. If these negotiations are successful they will provide a treaty which will peacefully regulate two-thirds of the world's surface, a treaty which will provide mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes arising between nations concerning their maritime boundaries and their activities on the high seas. We need look no further than the recent incident between Libya and the United States involving the Gulf of Sidra to realise just how important such mechanisms can be.
      </para>
      <para>
       Because the negotiations are important, tremendous efforts have been made over a period of nine years by representatives of 150 countries-virtually the whole international community. We have a vital interest and a vital role in these matters. We have played a very leading part successfully concluding a comprehensive and widely accepted convention. I thank our career representatives who have taken part in these negotiations. It is not only in Australia's interest but also in the interest of the international community. Let me reiterate what it means to Australia at the national level. It means that we acquire an extended territorial sea of 12 miles over which we will exercise full sovereignty. In addition, we will acquire a 200-mile economic zone which will give us effective, if somewhat limited, sovereignty over an additional one million square miles of territory off the Australian coastline. This territory is rich in mineral, hydrocarbon and marine resources. We are also guaranteed freedom of passage for our own merchant fleet and our navy through international straits and archipelagic waters, internationally regulated and ordered exploitation of the resources of the high seas and the deep seabed which will be not only to our advantage, but also, most importantly, to the advantage of many of the poorest countries in the world. We are also guaranteed the protection and preservation of that environment.
      </para>
      <para>
       For many developing countries, including a number of our Pacific island neighbours, the greatest single resource is the living and mineral resources of the 200-mile zone which the law of the sea treaty will give them. Our Pacific neighbours and developing countries do not want to be relying on handouts. What they want is to have their own resources developed and to be self-supporting members of the international community. The matter of the law of the sea, more than any single item on the current international agenda, provides the opportunity for them to achieve that goal. In two weeks' time the Commonwealth heads of government will meet in Melbourne. They will address themselves to the issue of North-South dialogue and the importance of a more equitable share of the world's resources with the nations which are now struggling to feed and clothe their people. But while many suggestions have been made, many proposals considered, the hard fact is that the major proposal on the international drawing board which would give practical help to the vast majority of these countries is the successful conclusion of the Law of the Sea Treaty.
      </para>
      <para>
       To its credit Australia has recognised this fact and has played a key role, but we have reached a crucial turning point-a point at which the greatest single power in the world and our ally, the United States, has thrown the success of the project into doubt. The most recent round of negotiations concluded late last month. The next round commences early next year. The Conference has decided that it will be the final opportunity to reach agreement, but unfortunately at this point the United States has made no commitment to attend the final session. I sincerely hope that it will do so, and the point of this motion is to impress upon the United States how important this issue is as seen from the Pacific region.
      </para>
      <para>
       I had discussions recently in respect of the law of the sea negotiations with the Foreign Minister of Mexico, the Foreign Minister of Canada, and the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Fiji. There is a strong feeling of support for this issue and concern at the failure of the United States to agree to a successful conclusion. When I spoke to the Prime Minister of one of the leading countries in the Pacific I asked him what the position in the Pacific would be if the United States did not co-operate. He made this point: The United States would not have a friend left in the Pacific. The Opposition does not want to see that happen and I know that the Government does not want to see it happen. The purpose of this motion is to convey our concern to Washington in a most sincere spirit of friendship and co-operation.

        —I second the motion. The Government supports it in the bipartisan spirit which has characterised the approach of successive Australian governments to the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The motion refers to Australia's vital interests and to the early conclusion of the law of the sea negotiations. This is a point I have made frequently both inside and outside this House. In a statement I made to the House on 26 May, as honourable members may recall, I said that Australia, as an island continent with extensive off-shore areas and heavily dependent on international trade, had a vital interest in the issues before the Conference and that it was an objective of the Australian Government that the international law of the sea should be cleared of the doubts and uncertainties that now exist.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       To this end successive governments of Australia, both on this side of politics and the other, have taken the view that our substantial interests in the law of the sea would best be protected by the early adoption of a comprehensive and widely accepted convention. It is not just our national interests but also our membership of the international community which provide strong grounds for maintaining the bipartisan spirit with respect to the Law of the Sea Conference. International agreement on a regime to cover all the resources of the sea and all the uses to which the sea can be put would be of enormous significance to the international community. It would represent a triumph of co-operation over conflict and of dialogue over dispute.
      </para>
      <para>
       I take this opportunity to inform the House briefly of the most recent developments at the Law of the Sea Conference whose resumed tenth session ended, after four weeks work, on 28 August. Firstly, on specific issues a wide measure of agreement was reached on the sensitive question of how maritime boundaries should be drawn between adjacent or opposite states. In addition, the Conference decided that the proposed international seabed authority, the body that will regulate mining activities on the deep-sea bed beyond national jurisdiction, would be located in Jamaica and that the Law of the Sea Tribunal would be located in Hamburg in the Federal Republic of Germany. But perhaps the most significant achievement of the session was that the Conference survived the strains arising out of the continuing uncertainty over the future participation of the United States in its work. That nation was given the opportunity of discussing the concerns it has with the present draft convention in preparation for the United States Administration to decide its future course.
      </para>
      <para>
       As stated in the motion before the House, we hope that the United States Government will now decide to join with the rest of the international community in working for the successful conclusion of the work of the Conference at its eleventh session which is to be held in March and April next year. It is a hope that will be widely shared around the world. I expect that a number of countries may be making their views known to the United States authorities. The Forum island countries of the Pacific have suggested that the Law of the Sea Conference be discussed at the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. I welcome the opportunity that this motion provides for this House to make its views known on a subject which has such special importance for us as a major trading nation and as an island continent.

        —I join in this debate very briefly as I was Minister for the Environment at the time we were involved in these discussions. A number of factors were involved. We were concerned that with unrestrained exploitation the environmental threats could have an effect on everybody, not just those countries that border the sea. If the ocean is damaged or the ecology of the ocean is in any way harmed that may have very harmful effects on us all. After all, we draw a lot of living resources from the sea and that is the danger. We need only to look at the effect of unrestrained whaling to see what I am talking about. Of course, the large enterprises in America that are already geared up to develop these resources in the sea wish to proceed straight away and do not want to be restrained by anything.

       My fear-which obviously is implied in this motion-is that the American Administration appears at this stage to be bowing to those commercial pressures and not paying due regard to the concern of the rest of the world, including, I suggest, the long term interests of the United States of America. For those reasons it is a very significant fact that we have managed to evolve a bipartisan approach to this problem. Without the law of the sea we will be confronted with enormous problems. It is extremely important that a satisfactory conclusion be drawn to the negotiations that have gone on for years, and to which the Americans have been a party. Sadly, the new regime appears to have failed to take into account this long and painful development and it is too readily bowing to pressure from narrow commercial interests in the United States. For that reason I certainly support this recommendation.

         —There could be no more important matter in the world today than the survival of the world. The purpose of this discussion of a matter of public importance is to condemn the Government for its failure to pursue policies which would lead to the eventual peace and stability of the world. I know that for some time the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has made speeches on the matter but the question is: What happens following those speeches? In fact, in the period between speeches we get nothing other than a further escalation of armaments. This situation occurs in relation to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America and a number of intermediaries that are very busily engaged in the production of weapons. Unfortunately and tragically those weapons are being used every day, every hour, and every minute for the death and destruction of human beings. We cannot just step aside and say 'it will not happen to us'. Once we come to the nuclear threshold-we have now reached that point-we are all involved. As we are all involved we have a vested interest in making our point of view known.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        A very good forum for this would be the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting conference which is about to take place in Australia. What the heads of government assembling here can do to convince the super powers and the other powers in the world about what must be done to bring about a cessation of the arms race and de-escalation of weapons-ultimately, the removal of all weapons-ought to be the number one item on the agenda. I am well aware that there has been a build up of weapons between the super powers. But it is also very significant that in Australia we are rather silent about condemning what is happening. We are prepared to condemn the Russians, and so they should be condemned when they invade Afghanistan and threaten Poland. Everybody accepts that situation. But we seem to be very soft on the issue of the deterrent build up of arms in the Western countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        I find most ridiculous the suggestion that we can support the concept of the neutron bomb. That suggestion is put on the basis that the United States must have the neutron bomb to match the Russian tanks that are assembled on the western flank of Europe. Admittedly, the Russians have a lot of tanks there but we must also think about their eastern flank. If honourable members want to put a case from the point of view of numbers-surely it should not be left to that-there are probably more tanks behind the North Atlantic Treaty organisation forces than the Russians have. For sheer arithmetical calculations we do not just look at whether one country has 4,500 tanks and the NATO forces have perhaps 1,500 and then exclude from that count the number of tanks that, for example, France or the United Kingdom have and the question of other supporting arms. I think it is ridiculous to say that we must have the neutron bomb concept to counter the tank concept. The reasoning is not valid. We are not going to get a limited nuclear war. The neutron bomb is a nuclear weapon. In fact we are fast approaching the neutron bullet, a weapon that can be used in action by every soldier. Once the nuclear capacity is used in warfare there is no limit to the extent to which it will eventually be used. If we brought all the nuclear missiles of the two super powers into play they would exceed 20,000. The pair are evenly balanced. The United States said that at the moment it cannot find any way to eliminate them. Perhaps we can understand that if the question is approached on the concept that what the Soviet Union has must be matched. By the same token, the Soviet Union says that it cannot see where it can give ground because of the concentration against it. That is a valid argument in a number of areas, not the least of which is the United States policy to build up China as a third force to counter any Soviet expansion.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is Australia about? Surely, as a third party involved in this area, we could say that we do not applaud the neutron bomb. Yet the Prime Minister has said that he can understand the reasons for it. At the same time, have we deplored other matters that relate directly to the future of Australia? Why are we saying that there is nothing wrong with a concept of giving arms to China? Why is it that we make no protest when the Chinese fire an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific and say we understand it, think it is reasonable, and thank them for giving us notice in advance? Does that do anything for peace and stability in the world? Why is it that we think it is reasonable to suggest that Japan could be re-armed on the basis that it also will act as a deterrent to the Soviet Union? In the process of talking about our region, why is it that we make no condemnation of the fact that Mr Holdridge, a senior United States diplomat, said when in China that there was no reason why there should not be military pressure put on Vietnam? There was no objection at all from this Government.

        At the present there is military action in Afghanistan, a civil war perhaps in Iran, and certainly a war between Iraq and Iran, conflict is still raging in Lebanon in the Middle East. At least 200,000 Lebanese are living in this country. They are wondering when the Government will say something about the future of Lebanon. There has been plenty of discussion about a peacekeeping force for Sinai. But there has been no Government discussion at all about the future of the Palestinians and the West Bank. The fact that that matter has not been solved has brought about the virtual destruction of Lebanon. This is, of course, a crucial issue for the Lebanese people. They cannot understand why the peacekeeping force has to be limited to one segment of that area when their country is being destroyed and when thousands upon thousands of Lebanese have died. Their next of kin in Australia are wondering when the Government will raise the question of peace and stability in that region.
       </para>
       <para>
        All armaments used in these conflicts are supplied by either the Soviet Union or the United States. They produce billions and billions of dollars worth of weapons, not for their own defence in many cases, but for sale. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute says that the Soviet Union is doing very well, thank you. It supplies about 30 per cent of arms sales to the Third World. The United States, not to be outdone, provides about 45 per cent. In the past 10 years arms sales to the Third World have totalled $US60 billion. So, there is a race between the two super-powers. They run the most profitable business in the world-selling arms to others. We, in Australia, have not officially condemned what is happening.
       </para>
       <para>
        In considering the question of de-escalation of the arms race, Australia should adopt some of the initiatives that have been adopted by other countries. I recommend to the Government that it seek membership of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues. The Commission recently held its third meeting in Vienna. In simple terms, its idea is to prevent armament and to guarantee progress towards disarmament. It has a distinguished membership. Members include the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Mr Ramphal, who will be leading the secretariat of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne in a few days time; the former Prime Ministers of Sweden, Norway and Holland; Mr Cyrus Vance, the former United States Secretary of State; Dr David Owen, the former British Foreign Secretary; Mr Arbatov of the Soviet Union and others. That membership shows that at least there can be an assembly of people who can talk how to save the world and how to bring about peace in the world. Unless that is done we are heading for a holocaust no matter how we try to avoid it. In a speech to the United Nations on disarmament in 1978, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said:

We need methods to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons among nations which currently do not have them. We need to study the relationship between disarmament and the developing needs of the poor countries and we need the creation of reasonable arms control arrangements such as an Indian Ocean zone of peace.
       </para>
       <para>
        We applaud all that. What has happened to those concepts outlined in the Prime Minister's speech in 1978? Washington has failed to make progress with the SALT agreement. It has abandoned it. Whilst it may be claimed it abandoned it because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, I remind the House that I knew well before that that it would not be done because United States senators took a view in which they did not agree with President Carter. They had no intention of endorsing SALT two arrangements. It is no excuse to say that there were difficulties over Afghanistan that prevented the United States from going ahead with that agreement. The United States has opposed the creation of a comprehensive test ban treaty. Far from preventing the spread of nuclear weapons among nations the policies that are now being adopted encourage their proliferation, not the least of which policies would offer an encouragement to South Africa to become very active, particularly in relation to Angola. It is thought that the South Africans have a capacity for building armaments with a nuclear potential. Do these policies do anything to encourage Japan, which also has a nuclear potential, to increase its defence forces? This Government said nothing about that. The introduction into Australian territory of the B52 bombers, obviously with a nuclear capacity, does nothing about safeguarding us in the immediate future. Talk about a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean does nothing when we have the B52 bombers operating in that sphere.
       </para>
       <para>
        We can applaud the United States for suggesting that there ought to be zones of peace in the Middle East and the Pacific Ocean. We would like to extend that zone of peace to the Indian Ocean. We commend those things. The Reagan Administration does not seem to be doing anything about the need to study that relationship. 'Zone of peace' is just an expression. When we talk of disarmament and the poor countries being involved in war we seem to be going in the other direction. There seems to be this feeling in the Reagan Administration of not really being interested in the North-South dialogue. That is a matter of great concern. I notice that it has been made clear in the Reagan Budget that foreign aid to the poorer countries has been reduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the context of this matter of public importance which we are putting to the House this morning let us look at the facts as they are now as against what the Prime Minister expressed them to be-facts with which we agreed in 1978-and then let us look at what has happened from our point of view. Let us look at this question of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We have abandoned the requirement of consent before reprocessing. Let us look at what is happening in relation to weapon capacity and sales. Does it do anything for peace and stability to suggest that we will encourage the United States to sell some $2.25 billion worth of equipment to Pakistan? Pakistan also has a nuclear capacity and could well be involved in a nuclear confrontation with India. What does India do? It immediately decides that it too has to escalate its ability to provide a nuclear capacity. We can look immediately to our north, where a concentration, use and encouragement of weapons could lead to a situation where, if disaster breaks out, we would get the residue. If there is military action between China and Vietnam we will have to deal with the millions of refugees; nobody else will.
       </para>
       <para>
        What sort of policy is the Government adopting when it encourages no aid to Vietnam? In fact, it wants to bring Vietnam to its knees. Of what value was it to wait until yesterday to protest to Pretoria about the invasion of Angola by the South Africans? They know that they need not care any more about apartheid because the United States Administration said: 'Do not worry about it; we will give you full support'. Certainly we oppose communism. The great threat to the world is the fact that communism is failing. There could be encouragement by the Soviet Union if it were suggested that it adopt military action to prop up some of these failures, whether it be in Poland or elsewhere. If in that process there is escalation of the fear that the United States and other countries are also building up their weapons, where is the deterrent? If some country thinks it will fail in a confrontation, it might fire the first weapon.
       </para>
       <para>
        We want to see in Australia an independent approach to this issue on the basis of what can be done for the world. Our role is not to remain silent. We should not just run along with what everybody else thinks ought to be the situation. There are too many troubles now. They relate to the Middle East. They relate to South East Asia. They relate to the African continent. They relate to Latin America. Every one of those areas is using armaments. What are these countries being encouraged to do all the time-to contain the philosophy of communism? That is no way to do it.

         —The Government welcomes this opportunity to put on record its policy on nuclear disarmament and arms control generally. The Government has pursued consistently and vigorously a policy of nuclear disarmament and strongly supports the goal of non-proliferation-the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons. At the Special Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on disarmament held in New York in July 1978 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-this is a quote additional to that given by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen)-said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The first focus of the program of action for arms control and disarmament must be on issues of nuclear arms control. My Government's position is clear and unequivocal. We oppose further escalation of the nuclear arms race. We oppose the spread of nuclear weapons.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the Special Session the Prime Minister outlined the Government's approach to nuclear disarmament. He stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        First, the nuclear weapons powers must take effective action to limit and reduce their nuclear arsenals. Second, there must be an end to nuclear testing in all environments. Third, the international non-proliferation system must be strengthened.
       </para>
       <para>
        In practical terms this approach has meant Australian support for the strategic arms limitation talks-that is SALT-process. That process is essential to the limitation of the vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Government has also been a leading proponent of the drawing up of a comprehensive test ban treaty-the CTB. This is essential to action designed to meet the objective of an end to nuclear testing in all environments. The Government's unwavering support for the non-proliferation treaty regime has played an important part in shoring up measures against horizontal proliferation.
       </para>
       <para>
        It must be recognised, though, that the current international climate is not favourable to the successful negotiation of disarmament and arms control measures. The reason for this is the Soviet Union's armaments program and the instability and anxiety it has created by such actions as its invasion of Afghanistan and its support for Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea. The willingness of states to enter into successful arms control and disarmament measures depends upon a degree of mutual trust and confidence. It is tragic that Soviet actions and Soviet policy have jeopardised that trust and confidence. Notwithstanding this international political climate the Government is and remains determined to maintain its strong support for the goal of disarmament and the negotiation of balanced and verifiable measures of arms control.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a statement to Parliament on 24 March I stressed that either 'inadvertently' or 'deliberately' there 'are always some, while they find it possible to remain silent in the face of huge military efforts on the part of the Soviet Union, raise the cry of war mongering whenever the West shows any signs of matching that effort.' The fact remains that as the United States reduced or stabilised its military forces over the last decade the Soviet response has been an unrelenting and threatening build-up in all theatres.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Reagan Administration has emphasised that there is a direct relationship between arms control and disarmament measures and the maintenance of general international security. Both President Reagan and Secretary of State Haig have pledged the United States to continuing support for balanced and verifiable disarmament and arms control measures. They have, however, made it clear that any such measures are bound to fail unless they are linked to restoration of the strategic balance and strengthening of the security of nations. For its part, the United States has made it clear that it is determined to redress the strategic balance with the Soviet Union. This is consistent with United States' security and supports Western security generally. The government has no doubt that the United States will continue to exercise its global responsibilities to the benefit of peace and security in the world. Indeed, Secretary of State Haig has indicated that he will be meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko later this month to discuss the resumption of United States-Soviet negotiations on the limitation of theatre nuclear forces in Europe. It is hoped that those negotiations will resume towards the end of this year. We support this positive development.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision by the United States Government to manufacture and stockpile the enhanced radiation weapon-that is, the neutron bomb-must be seen in its proper context. The previous United States Administration gave consideration to the manufacture of that weapon but decided to defer such a decision. It is a matter for deepest regret that subsequently the Soviet Union did not respond positively to that decision. Instead, it continued with a massive and threatening armaments program with particular impact upon the European theatre. It is in response to that Soviet policy that the United States Administration has now felt it necessary to proceed to manufacture the neutron weapon. That weapon has as its main purpose the deterrence of Soviet armoured capability in Europe. No decision has yet been made on the deployment of the weapon, which is a matter for consideration between the United States and its European allies. I would also recall that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics itself is reported to have tested a neutron weapon and that France has tested a weapon and intends to pursue studies and research into the possible development of the weapon.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite contrary to what might be inferred from the wording of the issue before the House, Australia is an active participant in the major international bodies concerned with disarmament and arms control negotiations. It has played a prominent role, particularly in the United Nations Committee on Disarmament and in the First Commitee of the General Assembly where arms control and disarmament matters are considered. Australia's efforts in this regard have been recognised internationally as strong and helpful. There can be no doubt about the Government's deep commitment to nuclear disarmament and to the cessation of the global arms race. As my colleagues are well aware successive Australian Governments over a long period have followed a policy of rigorous control over the export of arms and warlike stores. Applications for the sale abroad of such material from Australian sources are subjected to close and rigorous scrutiny.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is opposed to private traffic in arms. With regard to governments, a commitment is required of the importing government that there will be no resale to third countries without the prior approval of the Australian Government. The controls imposed by the Australian Government on the export of arms and warlike stores are fully in keeping with those applied by like-minded governments on countries possessing comparable weapons manufacturing industries. The controls we apply serve both Australia's national interests and the broader courses of world peace and stability. The Government remains concerned, however, over the magnitude of international trade in armaments. It is committed to assist in the development of any effective measures which might reduce the magnitude of that trade. It is also fully aware, however, that the surest and most enduring way to reduce trade in arms is for all governments to pursue policies, consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, which respect the independence and security of all States. It is only when States are able to feel secure and have confidence in their dealings with other States that the recourse to arms will be reduced. I repeat: It is the policies of the Soviet Union which constitute today the chief source of insecurity and mistrust between many nations in both the developed and the developing world.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has emphasised the importance it attaches to the North-South dialogue, to an improvement in practical co-operation between the developed and developing world. This is an issue of major international significance. That priority is one of the chief victims of aggressive and hostile foreign policies. Equally, progress in the North-South dialogue would be greatly assisted by progress in disarmament and arms control measures. For our part, we are committed to playing the most positive role possible on both of these fronts-arms control and disarmament measures, and the maintenance of the North-South dialogue.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, in the light of recent reports of the possible use of lethal toxic agents in Laos and Kampuchea, I would like to stress that the Australian Government is unequivocally opposed to the use of chemical and biological weapons. The Government notes with concern, however, the increasing number of reports of the use of such weapons in recent years, not only in Indo-China but also Afghanistan and elsewhere. Such means of warfare are banned by the 1925 Geneva Protocol for the prohibition of the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of bacteriological methods of warfare. The development of biological agents or toxins as weapons is specifically prohibited by the 1972 Convention on Biological Weapons. Australia is a party to both these conventions. At last year's session of the United Nations General Assembly, Australia co-sponsored a resolution which led to the establishment of a group of qualified medical and technical experts to investigate reports of chemical weapons use. The report of this expert group is expected shortly.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia is an active participant in discussions in the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva of a proposed international treaty for a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons. I am sure that my colleague would support the need for the rigorous investigation of all reports involving the use of chemical weapons and, should they be substantiated, would join in condemning their use.

        That the Bill be now read a second time.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill makes a number of unrelated amendments to the Defence Act 1903 and consequential amendments to the Defence (Visiting Forces) Act 1963. The most pressing of the amendments are those made by clause 6 of the Bill, which are intended to provide a means of protecting the livelihood of Defence Force reservists who suffer long term total incapacity for work as a result of compensable injuries received during Reserve service. Publicity was given some time ago to the fact that some Reserve units were taking out commercial insurance policies, at their own expense, to meet this situation. The Government takes the view that it is not appropriate that reservists should have to pay their own premiums to protect themselves against events occurring outside their normal civilian occupations, when these events are related to voluntary national defence training in their spare time. The Government accordingly decided, as I announced on 30 June this year, that legislation should be brought down to amend the Defence Act to bring the entitlements of totally incapacitated reservists more into line with those of totally incapacitated regular servicemen.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act 1971, employees totally incapacitated through their employment receive normal weekly earnings for up to 26 weeks and then statutory weekly payments not exceeding a prescribed amount per week, with extra amounts for dependants. In the case of regular servicemen, their normal military salary and relevant allowances continue while they remain members. If such a member's service is terminated and his incapacity is assessed as more than 60 per cent in relation to civil employment, he becomes entitled to a class 'A' Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits invalidity pension of 76.5 per cent of his normal military salary.
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 58B of the Defence Act empowers the Minister for Defence to determine financial conditions of service for members of the Defence Force. Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 58B to empower the Minister for Defence to determine the payment of additional compensation to reservists to whom compensation is payable under the Compensation Act. It is intended that a determination be made entitling a totally incapacitated reservist, after the first 26 weeks of incapacity, to an addition to the amount payable under the Compensation Act to bring his total weekly entitlement to 76.5 per cent of his average civilian weekly earnings or, if he was previously unemployed or a student, to 76.5 per cent of his reserve military salary. This determination will, in common with all other section 58B determinations, be subject to tabling in, and disallowance by, the Parliament, and will be drafted in such a way as to give the reservist a right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against decisions made under the determination concerning the amount of additional compensation payable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 9 of the Bill marks an interesting new development, namely, the necessity to legislate regarding control over members of the public using defence lands for recreational purposes where general access for that purpose is permitted. There is an increasing use by the public of defence property for recreational purposes where this is compatible with defence requirements. This is a matter of interest to State authorities from at least four aspects, namely, the availability of such areas for use by their citizens; the development in such areas of recreational facilities such as barbeques and camping areas; the conservation of such areas; and the maintenance of law and order in such areas. The authorities of the States concerned have been most co-operative in this matter. I thank them for that co-operation. However, the States lack the power to make the legislation required to provide the necessary controls.
       </para>
       <para>
        Adequate power to control the activities of members of the public on defence property is normally provided by the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971, the Crimes Act 1914, the Defence Act 1903 and State criminal law. However, these powers and common law powers are not very suitable where persons are permitted to enter for recreational purposes, particularly where large areas are involved necessitating the employment of rangers. Where the ecology of the area is fragile, as at Garden Island in Western Australia, it is essential that there be practical powers of control over such matters as camping, the lighting of fires, the use of off-road vehicles and the removal of plants.
       </para>
       <para>
        The nature and extent of the problem will be appreciated when I mention that some of the defence properties are quite large. Garden Island in Western Australia is about 1,200 hectares in extent, of which the public is allowed access to an area of about 950 hectares. Beecroft Peninsula at Jervis Bay is even larger, comprising about 4,600 hectares. We are faced, in effect, with a situation similar in a number of respects to that presented by the control of national parks, and the solution adopted is to pass legislation based, to the extent appropriate, on the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 of the Commonwealth. Clause 9 accordingly inserts a new Part IXB into the Defence Act which provides for such matters as the declaration of the relevant parts of defence lands as public areas; the appointment of rangers; their powers of arrest and search; and offences such as impersonating or assaulting rangers. The legislation also empowers the Minister for Defence to make by-laws relating to the control and management of public areas. All by-laws will be subject to tabling in, and disallowance by, the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provision is also made permitting the continued operation of State and Territory laws. This will permit the operation of laws such as those relating to the declaration of high fire danger. On the question of defence lands, I mention finally the Naval Establishments (Public Areas) Regulations. These were made at the end of 1980 as an interim arrangement pending the preparation and passing of the Bill now before the House. The regulations are necessarily limited in their scope. They cannot apply to all defence lands but only to those which fall within the definition of 'naval establishment' in the Naval Defence Act 1910, nor can they encompass all the matters dealt with in the new Part IXB of the Defence Act. The regulations will be repealed in due course.
       </para>
       <para>
        The remaining provisions of the Bill may be dealt with more briefly. Clause 8, taken in conjunction with Part III of the Bill, which amends the Defence (Visiting Forces) Act 1963, in effect transfers certain provisions from the latter Act to the Defence Act. The operation of these provisions is not restricted to visiting forces and their inclusion in the Defence (Visiting Forces) Act 1963 was done as a matter of expediency, as the House was informed at the time. The provisions in question relate to attachments of personnel between the Australian Defence Force and the armed forces of other countries, mutual powers of command between such forces and the arrest and disposal of illegal absentees from the armed forces of other countries. In the main, the differences between the new provisions and the existing provisions are of a drafting or clarifying nature.
       </para>
       <para>
        Significant changes are the provision of additional safeguards where illegal absentees from the forces of other countries are held in custody by the Australian authorities. The Bill requires the person who has custody of the illegal absentee to cause an authorised officer to be informed and to ensure that the person in custody understands his right to request his release. The power of an authorised officer, who is appointed by a Chief of Staff, to hand the arrested person over to the authorities of his own country is abolished and this power is to be vested in the Minister for Defence. One other significant change has been made where an officer of the armed forces of another country is given command over Australian forces. The Chief of Defence Force Staff is empowered by the Bill to limit the scope of the powers of command and discipline that may be exercised.
       </para>
       <para>
        The remaining amendments of any consequence are made to the regulation-making powers in the Defence Act. These clarify the power to make regulations on four matters. Firstly, in addition to providing for the forfeiture of salary and allowances of members of the Defence Force who are absent without leave, provision may be made for the suspension of the payment of salary. Secondly, in addition to providing for the establishment and operation of Service canteens and messes, provision may be made subjecting them to Commonwealth, State and Territory taxes, other than income tax. Thirdly, provision may be made for compensation by the Commonwealth for loss, injury or damage by reason of anything done under the Defence Act as, for example, the exercise of control over building heights in the vicinity of defence airfields. Fourthly, in addition to providing for the appointment and procedures of service courts and boards of inquiry, provision may be made under which a witness may be compelled to answer a question although the answer may be self-incriminating, and a witness may be provided with protection against the use of the answer in proceedings against him before a Service tribunal or a civil court.
       </para>
       <para>
        This last matter calls for further explanation. Boards of inquiry are held, not infrequently, to investigate such matters as the loss of an aircraft, a fatal accident involving the use of service weapons or equipment, the grounding of a ship or a failure in the operation of a ship's navigational or propulsion equipment, as well as deficiencies in, loss of or damage to stores. The primary purpose of a board of inquiry, particularly if there has been a serious or fatal accident, is to ascertain as quickly as possible what, if anything, went wrong and to prevent a recurrence. It may be that the board of inquiry's investigation will reveal some dereliction of duty and result in subsequent disciplinary action, but this must not be allowed to negate the primary purpose of the inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        In order that the truth be established without delay, it is essential that witnesses give their evidence frankly. In the case of possible equipment failure, for example, which could result in, say, the grounding of aircraft, a witness who is provided with adequate protection against self-incrimination would probably be more ready to admit that the failure was caused by error on his part and not by any inherent defect in design. The law relating to boards of accident inquiry under the Air Navigation Act 1920 and to royal commissions, contains similar provisions. I commend the Bill to honourable members.

        —The Opposition is not opposing these Bills which apply State taxes to the Australian Capital Territory, apparently in some instances at the behest of the State governments concerned. However, it is our intention to move an amendment because we are not satisfied that the application of State taxes as an automatic consequence of State government activities or State government representations is acceptable to a significant portion of the Australian population. Australian Capital Territory residents are the only group within Australia which is denied any say in local and State type taxes applied to their area and is also denied the right to fix its priorities on where those taxes should apply and what concessions would apply to that area.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Opposition will move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Australian Capital Territory Taxation (Administration) Amendment Bill. The amendment sets out a position which should be acceptable to the Australian Parliament because it outlines some degree of acceptance of the fact that people are entitled to express opinions and to have representations when taxes are applied. That argument is not valid in respect of national taxes or those taxes which are applied generally throughout the Australian community on behalf of the Australian Government as revenue measures. We may or may not object and the members who represent this area may or may not object to those Commonwealth revenue measures. We have a right to express an opinion in this place and to vote directly against these measures. Those taxes which are a consequence really of providing a tax framework which is comparable with those in the States and the Northern Territory are at the behest of those governments for their revenue needs and are framed in such a way as the representatives of the people in those areas, in isolation from the rest of the Commonwealth, wish to apply their taxes.
      </para>
      <para>
       Because the Australian Capital Territory has no form of self-government or municipal government and is dependent on this Parliament for its basic decision making process, we believe it is necessary that prior to the application of additional State type taxes the Parliament should have before it a comparison of State type taxes and other related matters as they apply in the various States and Territories. For instance, whilst payroll tax is not part of this Bill, the Australian Capital Territory applies payroll tax on the basis that it is applied in New South Wales and Victoria. That is the justification for payroll tax in the Australian Capital Territory. It is a Commonwealth revenue item and the revenue raised may or may not be returned to the residents of the Australian Capital Territory as part of its State tax support and for the support of those programs in this area which would have derived from State Budgets. But those taxes are raised without the same considerations which go into the taxes in the States. For instance, if the Australian Capital Territory, which is subject, as I understand it, to taxes on payroll similar to New South Wales-and certainly not at a lower rate-were in fact applying the taxes under the New South Wales State Act which applies to all the areas which surround the Australian Capital Territory, and which I think it is reasonable to say is as a general consequence in competition with the Australian Capital Territory in respect of say, private development capital for business activities, then those taxes would be subject to certain concessions which are not available in the Australian Capital Territory. Certainly, in Victoria, such concessions are available. For example, in Geelong in my electorate which would seem to be reasonably comparable-it is not quite as large though it is a single provincial city-a 50 per cent deduction in payroll tax is available to decentralised industries established in that area. In Ballarat and Bendigo in Victoria a total exemption from payroll tax is available to decentralised industries. This may or may not be an advantage. It may or may not be something which the residents of the Australian Capital Territory would wish as one of their priorities on taxes. But it is not an option open to them. They are, in fact, dependent to some degree on pressure from States which are seeking to make the Australian Capital Territory less attractive for business and other activities than their own competing interests. The States have a vested interest in that respect. They are also seeking to have applied, without any consideration of the priorities which the residents of this area would apply, taxes which may or may not have been chosen as revenue measures had this area made its own determinations.
      </para>
      <para>
       This legislation applies taxes in respect of a number of matters. I believe we are entitled as a parliament to have before us a comparative statement in respect of taxes which are applied in the Australian Capital Territory, the revenue measures available in the Australian Capital Territory. I think it is also essential-and this is especially so with regard to vehicle registrations-to have before us some indication of the priorities which would exist if members of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly were, in fact, determining which concessions would be available. For instance, whilst probably it is proper for this Parliament to look on diplomatic registrations as a reasonable exemption from motor registrations-it is probable that applying these registration fees would break an international convention-it is not a priority which I think the people of Victoria, New South Wales or Tasmania would accept as reasonable for forgoing revenues. The Australian Capital Territory licensing and registration revenues are, in fact, deductible by those amounts. There are varying forms of concessions on taxes and registrations in the different States. I believe that we cannot at this stage create a situation whereby Australian Capital Territory determination of these concessions is involved because the whole financial structure of the Australian Capital Territory is, to say the least, unclear and it is certainly tied up in Commonwealth revenues to an extent which makes it almost unextractable. Therefore a proper picture of input and expenditure does not exist. For those reasons the Opposition moves:
      </para>
      <para>
       That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
      </para>
      <para>
       'consideration of the Bill be deferred until (a) the House is provided with detailed comparisons with overall localised taxes and revenue measures applied in the States and the Northern Territory, and (b) the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly is consulted on the application in the Australian Capital Territory of state related taxes and that the Assembly be requested to provide a list of priorities for concessions from state type fees and taxes, in order that the Australian Capital Territory will have comparable rights to choose its own priorities as enjoyed by the States and the Northern Territory'.
      </para>
      <para>
       I move that motion because it expresses what I believe are the basic rights of the people of the Territory. They are entitled to know what in fact the financial structure of the area is, what charges and costs are applied, and whether those charges and costs are being applied in a way in which they would if this area were part of a State or were a self-governing Territory. I believe that in the priorities for exemptions, the people of the Territory should not be worse off than those of the States merely because they are governed by the Australian parliament. It is normal for the State governments, especially at times of elections, to make concessions in a number of areas where they are popular. I point out to the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) that in New South Wales, for instance, motorised wheel chairs are exempt from registration. I am not sure whether that is the case in the Australian Capital Territory. In New South Wales totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners have a concession of approximately 75 per cent. I am not aware whether that concession exists in the Australian Capital Territory. It may be that the Australian Capital Territory has different priorities-I have mentioned the matter of diplomats-but I believe we are entitled, if we are to continue to deny the Australian Capital Territory the right to determine its own concessional rates, to ask the Australian Capital Territory elected representatives for their opinions on these matters.

        —I would like first to comment on the amendment. I do not believe that anybody has any worries in the sense that figures ought to be available so that the Australian Capital Territory revenue and expenditure on State-like matters can be looked at in comparison with its needs and in comparison with what occurs in the States. It seems to me, however, that the amendment ought not to be supported because of the fact that at present it merely seeks to defer the collection of revenue which is an integral part of the Budget. Further, the present anomalies which are being removed are anomalies whose existence I do not believe would be argued by anybody. In other words, the amendment is not going to the root of any possible differences when the total cost comparisons are looked at; it merely seeks to correct some things which, in the eyes of any fair-minded people, ought to be corrected. They are some of the more obvious cases. Perhaps I will get a chance shortly to discuss why they are more obvious than some others.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I believe that the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) raised in an earlier debate relating to similar Bills flowing from the Budget as it affects the Australian Capital Territory this general question of where Canberra stands. Is Canberra better or worse off than the rest of Australia in terms of indirect tax collections, stamp duties and charges which are made on a State-like basis? We do not know. In the views of the Australian people, Canberra is a feather-bedded place, but I agree we do not know. I think I may have mentioned in this place that the late Senator Knight was always saying in private to me that the perception in Australia of Canberra's position in relation to charges is quite wrong. He never was able to show me proof of that, but I think the fact that he and the honourable member for Corio are prepared to say it shows that this comparison ought to be carried out. It will be carried out. I understand that the best body, the Commonwealth Grants Commission, will review this question in 1982. The Grants Commission is still looking at State relativities, and that is something that flowed from decisions made a few months ago. As soon as that State relativities examination is complete, the Commission will become involved in the Canberra question. It seems to me that rather than talk about deferral of present matters until that stage we ought to say: 'No. Let us get these more obvious things sorted out, and then, in a bipartisan spirit, let us look at what the Grants Commission tells us after its review of the Canberra situation in 1982'.
      </para>
      <para>
       The honourable member for Corio raised another important matter of principle, and that is what sort of judgment the Government ought to make on the Canberra charges question when we have a dichotomy of views. First, Canberra ought to be independent. The people who live in Canberra ought to have decisions made in respect of their revenue according to the specific requirements of Canberra. That recognises that any group in Australia ought to be regarded as a group in which specific decisions ought to be made. In other words, just because there is a specific charge in Western Australia there need not necessarily be the need for the same charge in Canberra. I recognise that. There are special needs and special circumstances in Canberra.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, Canberra is in the middle of New South Wales; it is completely surrounded by New South Wales. People cross the border, as they may in a federation, without any impediment and use the services of Canberra. That gives rise to the other point of view. How much special consideration ought to be given to the needs of Canberra when it is surrounded by New South Wales? It will be a matter of judgment. No doubt the best solution is some sort of compromise between the two conflicting aims. Certainly, in my position as representing many of the people who live in the surrounding areas of Canberra, I can say that the general view in my electorate is that charges ought to be the same. I have mentioned this matter in the House before. Since the present Government came to power in 1975 there has been a breaking down of the differences. I have instanced a number of areas previously in this place. I do not propose to refer to them again. Certainly insurance stamp duty and stamp duty on the transfer of motor vehicles are two areas in which the anomalies can create problems-perhaps not only for my area but also for the Australian Capital Territory.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is well known that a number of people who live in New South Wales contrive to have their motor vehicles registered in the Australian Capital Territory even though their place of residence in not in Canberra. When one considers the $2 in $100 stamp duty on the transfer of motor vehicle one can imagine people perhaps looking at ways and means of contriving in this fashion. It seems to me that we may as well call a spade a spade, regularise the procedures and not invite people, to break the theoretical law of New South Wales by going ahead with this. In regard to life insurance matters, I think it is fairly obvious that the people who work in Canberra or in the surrounding areas such as Queanbeyan freely move about. If they live in Queanbeyan today, they are quite likely to live in Canberra next year or vice versa. From that point of view, why have different charges for fundamental arrangements that people enter into such as life insurance? I just say that these things are fairly obvious anomalies that need to be corrected.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, one cannot run away from what flows from that, namely that the Commonwealth has a chance to increase its revenue. Of course, there are in New South Wales some charges that I could not advocate under any circumstances for the Australian Capital Territory. In New South Wales there are some quite heavy imposts. The honourable member for Corio has already referred to the payroll tax situation. In New South Wales there is now a surcharge for companies with payrolls of over $1m. That might sound harmless enough, but I can assure the House that there are in Queanbeyan companies which have payrolls of over $1m and the payrolls of some of the larger employers, such as the Queanbeyan Leagues Club, are extremely high. That one per cent surcharge by the New South Wales Government on payroll tax can cost a lot of money. One per cent of $1m is $10,000 and one per cent of $2m is $20,000. It is not peanuts. That is the sort of thing I do not want to see introduced in Canberra. If anything, I believe the Federal Government ought to be trying to give the lead on the payroll tax question towards the eventual total abolition of what I see as an iniquitous tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       I recognise-my position on this is quite well known-that if a tax of one sort is reduced or cut out by a State or Federal government without cutting back on programs, which is not usually possible, that forgone tax has to be raised in another way. Certainly I recognise that if payroll tax were cut out, taxes probably would have to be imposed in some other manner. It seems to me that, with payroll tax, the wrong people are being charged at the wrong point and that that militates against employment, especially at this time when employment is one of the most important issues in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       I want to raise a couple of other matters very briefly. First of all, the imposition of any new sales tax, which these Bills refer to, is in a sense a slight movement in the direction of a different mix of tax. This has been a hobby horse of mine, despite the fact that I recognise that in the community there is a perception that a change in the tax mix towards a higher proportion of indirect tax may impose problems for people on lower incomes. I do not agree that that proposition is right, if the situation is handled in a gradually phased way. On the other hand, I believe a mix of tax involving higher indirect taxes can to a very large degree give people greater discretion. One could say that if there are indirect taxes on clothing, that is not discretionary because one must clothe oneself. But that argument is not quite right. There are points in one's preference patterns where one will decide to buy an extra lot of clothing, a motor car or fruit or some other commodity. In our generally affluent society in Australia we have at present over-consumption of many of the things that were previously called essentials. I see anything in the tax system which gives individuals a discretion as a move in the best direction. Of course, on top of that-I do not want to canvass all the arguments-there is the other very substantial argument that wherever there is an indirect tax, many of the people who live in a cash economy, and there are plenty of them in Canberra, at least pay some tax. That is not a facile thing to say and it has been very forcefully put by such people as Professor Mathews.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another matter to which I hope the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) can address himself shortly concerns the anomalies with respect to workers compensation across the New South Wales-Australian Capital Territory border. The previous Minister for the Capital Territory addressed himself to a problem which occurred when Palmdale Insurance Ltd collapsed. A number of my constituents in Queanbeyan were very hard hit by that because they were employed by companies which had insured through Palmdale. There was a great problem because there was no supplementation fund, as exists in New South Wales, for the payment of workers compensation to people who were insured with a company which just could not pay out. The previous Minister corrected that anomaly by setting up a supplementation fund. That was largely due to the efforts of people like me. But a number of other anomalies, both with respect to the substantive nature of workers compensation payments in the Australian Capital Territory and with respect to procedural arrangements, need to be completely reviewed. A number of lawyers in my electorate of Eden-Monaro have pointed this out to me. They are the practitioners who found problems for New South Wales citizens who suffered injury when working in the Australian Capital Territory. That is an area to which I hope the Minister can address himself. I understand, certainly from a communication I received from him dated 7 August, that he will be doing that. In this legislation we are overcoming some of the anomalies that ought to be corrected in the interests of people in New South Wales and, I think, in the interests of fairness and an equitable system of taxation which, as much as possible, heads in the direction of treating people in this country on an equal basis.

        —On the AM program this morning and again in a report tabled in the other place a few moments ago there have been suggestions, conclusions and allegations related to my ministerial role with respect to the subsidiary of the Australian Dairy Corporation known as Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd. Paragraph 9.38 of the report comments, in part:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Committee concludes that on the balance of probabilities, Mr Sinclair's recollection of the events was not as reliable as that of Mr Webster. In other words, it appears to the Committee that on the balance of probabilities, Mr Sinclair was told of the terms of the compromise which necessarily involved a continuing breach of GATT.
      </para>
      <para>
       That statement is not true. I wish to advert very briefly to the reasons why that is a misrepresentation and an incorrect conclusion. The first is that I think it needs to be noted in this chamber that the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations is about propriety. Yet repeatedly letters, announcements and even this report have been pre-released to the media either prior to dispatch by the Chairman or prior to release to the other place. Indeed, Simon Nasht this morning on AM released the contents of this report. Yet until its release a few moments ago by the Chairman of the Committee, it was, of course, a privileged document. It is worth noting that the principal adviser to the Committee was moonlighting as a journalist with the Bulletin newspaper while employed as a full time member on the staff of the then Opposition Leader in the Senate. He is now, and has continued, in a role where one can only presume he has very close connections with the media, and one can only condemn whoever was responsible for these prior releases.
      </para>
      <para>
       Secondly, I think it needs to be said that with respect to this whole affair successive reports have been forwarded to the Australian Federal Police for inquiry relating to activities within Asia Dairy Industries. The matter was referred promptly by me and by my colleague the present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) to the Australian Federal Police, as was indicated this morning by my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman). While some reports have been received, I understand that a final report has not yet been received by the Minister. I only hope that the Commissioner of the Federal Police will now accelerate the conclusion of his report so that aspects relating to reference to some matters appertaining to the then Chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation can be concluded. If the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) believes any action should be taken, I hope that that too can be initiated at an early time.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think it needs to be said, however, that aspects of the references related to some allegations made regarding certain activities by the then Chairman. It is that Chairman's evidence that has been preferred in this report to that of the First Assistant Secretary of the Department of Primary Industry, Mr Wallace, whose evidence is presented on pages 170 to 173 of the report. In an analysis of that report any lawyer would be concerned at the way in which that evidence was taken and the cross-examination was conducted. I believe it is critical that, in the proceedings of committees before this Parliament, witnesses are treated with proper respect and that propriety is observed. It is interesting to note that Mr Wallace's recollection concurred with my own.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr O'Bryan, another senior officer-the then Assistant Secretary of the Department of Primary Industry-was also called on to give evidence. His evidence is found at page 170 of the report. It is of interest that Mr O'Bryan was also a member of the Australian Dairy Corporation Board. Part of his concern was that the then Chairman reported inadequately to the Australian Dairy Corporation on the activities of Asia Dairy Industries. Mr O'Bryan was, of course, also the principal adviser in the dairying area and he equally concurred with my recollection of events. So the conclusions to which I referred, that is, those contained in item 9.38 of the Committee's report, have been reached in spite of the evidence of the First Assistant Secretary of the Department of Primary Industry and the evidence of Mr O'Bryan, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Primary Industry. Mr O'Bryan has since retired on the grounds of invalidity. He was also the Government representative on the Australian Dairy Corporation. The conclusions are contrary also to all the minutes and documentation that were available to the Department of Primary Industry. In correspondence to the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, in an attachment which is included in the report at pages 152 to 156, I commented:
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not recall any discussion with Mr Webster on the nature of the outcome of the negotiations with HOMPI on the rebate following his return from Manila. Certainly, no evidence was provided to me to indicate that the A.D.C. share of the credit in the rebate account was being used to continue the rebate in breach of the GATT minimum price. Such an arrangement, if known about, would have been totally unacceptable to the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       I confirmed that evidence before this House by way of personal explanation on 7 May 1981. I refer honourable members to the House of Representatives Hansard of that date where I am reported as stating:
      </para>
      <para>
       I assert to that honourable gentleman and to the members of the Senate Committee that I believe the evidence given to them is totally correct and has the substance of my being a Minister and giving it in this place.
      </para>
      <para>
       And it would not differ-and I add these words-were it to be by way of statutory declaration or an oath. However, on that occasion in the House I said:
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not believe there is any reason why there should be a statutory declaration given to confirm formal correspondence entered into by me as a Minister in this place, to a chairman of a Committee in another place.
      </para>
      <para>
       I strongly support the contention that action should be taken by a government with a chairman of a statutory corporation or a subsidiary of a statutory corporation if it finds there is a breach of an international arrangement. Such action was undertaken by me immediately evidence came forward to that effect. The conclusions reached, however, in paragraph 9.38 of the Committee's report are inaccurate and against the evidence. I believe, therefore, that the report needs to be put straight immediately.

         —While the Opposition does not oppose the Australian Capital Territory Taxation (Administration) Amendment Bill and cognate Bills before us, nevertheless we have grave reservations about the underlying financial structure of the Australian Capital Territory. Accordingly, I have seconded the amendment put forward by my colleague the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). Since the Budget it has become more and more apparent that the Government is interested only in extracting as much revenue as possible from Canberra without providing a firm and reliable commitment to Canberra's future growth and development. When the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) spoke earlier he dealt with the problems that Canberra faces in relation to Queanbeyan and the need to look at the Australian Capital Territory and Queanbeyan on a regional basis. I wholeheartedly endorse that view.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I would like to make the very important point that if we are to have the same financial responsibilities as people in New South Wales, which I believe we should have, at the same time we should have the same systems of government and the same sorts of rights. Currently we do not have those. The people of Canberra have taxes and rates imposed on them without having any way of appealing against it. At the same time as having the same responsibilities as the States we should have also the same rights. That is where I think the Government has failed. At the same time as having these taxes imposed-which I have said we do not oppose-we believe we should have responsibilities. The Government has failed to give us a firm decision on the Commonwealth Grants Commission's proposed inquiry into the finances of the Australian Capital Territory. The Grants Commission has not yet been given its reference and the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) has not given us an assurance that the Grants Commission will begin this inquiry this calendar year. It is essential that it begin this inquiry as soon as possible. I believe that the sorts of vague assurances that we have been given are just not good enough.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is levying greatly increased charges on the people of Canberra and it is collecting more and more revenue without telling us how it is to be spent. The Budget has resulted in increased charges for a wide range of municipal services. Rates have gone up by an average of 13 per cent despite the fact that there is a surplus of approximately $6.8m in the municipal account. Where is the justification for this large increase when such a large surplus is in the account? I have heard the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) reply previously on this. He claims that there is not such a surplus. Yet the amount of money is quite clearly stated as appearing in the municipal accounts. It highlights the great problems we have in the Australian Capital Territory in coming to grips with our finances. The Government increases charges but does not explain to people why there is a need for the increases except to say 'the States pay it' or 'other local councils pay it'. But we do not have any say in determining those charges.
       </para>
       <para>
        The recent Australian Capital Territory Stamp Duty Amendment Bill increased charges for financial and business transactions on the grounds that these charges should be brought into line with those in the States. There is no argument with the proposition that Australian Capital Territory residents should pay a fair share of taxes similar to those which apply in the States. But we must remember also that the people of the Australian Capital Territory have no form of local or State government and no input into the municipal decisions which directly affect their lives. Every community throughout Australia has a local form of administration which is responsive to community needs and which can promote its interests. But not Canberra. Instead of that we find that the time of this Parliament has to be taken up consistently with debating whether we should have an increase in charges in the Australian Capital Territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        Canberra residents pay their taxes along with all other Australians yet they do not receive the 2 per cent of income tax collections made available for local government. Where does this money go? Nobody knows because there never has been a full examination of the financial arrangements for the Australian Capital Territory. Looking at the responsibilities of people to pay their taxes, if we did a breakdown of the figures I think we would find that the 68 per cent of people in the Australian Capital Territory work force who are Commonwealth public servants pay a much higher percentage of their income to the Australian Government because they cannot practise the tax avoidance and tax evasion which is practised by so many other Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Grants Commission inquiry is urgently needed to provide an independent assessment of Canberra's finances. Most of us expect that such an investigation will show that Canberra is indeed paying its own way. I wish more members of this Parliament were here today to hear this proposition because I get so sick of people saying to me: 'Look how well Canberra is going'. The truth of the matter is that Canberra pays its own way and these increased charges and levies only add to that burden. Nevertheless we are constantly told: 'Look how well off you are in Canberra'. That is why I think it is absolutely urgent that we have such an inquiry. I am not scared of the results and I am sure the people of Canberra are not scared of the results. But we need to have an examination. This Government is still dragging behind in getting this reference to the Grants Commission. We need the Grants Commission inquiry now, not at some indefinite time in the future. Why is the Government afraid to put it to the Grants Commission? Certainly the people of Canberra are tired of paying up, of having important financial decisions forced on them without having any input into those decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bills before us today are a further unnecessary impost on the people of Canberra as it appears that their primary purpose, along with the earlier stamp duty Bills, is to raise revenue for the government coffers. The people of Canberra probably would not mind paying that money if we knew where it was going or why these duties are imposed on us. But we do not know that. The purpose of the Australian Capital Territory Tax (Vehicle Registration) Bill is to tax all new registrations and transfers of existing registrations at a rate of $2 in every $100 or part thereof. This will mean that on an average a second-hand car worth $4,000 a tax of $80 will have to be paid before the vehicle can be registered, and on the cost of a new car of, say, $7,000 the tax payable will be $140. This tax will be imposed without any examination of other recent decisions concerning vehicle registration in the Australian Capital Territory. For example, the infamous razor gang decided to abandon the system of annual independent inspections. No reason was given why that should be done. There is no possible philosophical basis for lowering road safety standards-at least I hope not. There is no saving of government expenditure as the vehicle testing stations at Phillip and Dickson are specially designed and equipped buildings which cannot be converted for any other use. The Canberra community has been shocked by this callous disregard for public safety which has been displayed by an ad hoc decision, and that this is what is was.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not just the people of Canberra who have been amazed by the razor gang's decision. I have heard from many people who live in other parts of Australia and who admired the safety precautions we took in Canberra. They are amazed to find now that those precautions are to be abolished for no good reason. The Canberra public has expressed total opposition at every opportunity to this decision. Thousands of people have signed petitions which have been presented in this Parliament. Many have written letters to newspapers, phoned talk-back radio programs and written to members of parliament. Everywhere one goes in Canberra it is obvious that there is a strong consensus of opinion about the need for independent vehicle testing in the Australian Capital Territory. What can people do about it? Nothing can be done because this decision was taken by a group of Ministers who have no responsibility for the Australian Capital Territory. I know that the Minister for the Capital Territory was not involved in the so-called Lynch razor gang committee. But I ask him to put the case for Canberra to the Lynch committee to try to get a reversal of that decision, which I believe was based on no firm foundation.
       </para>
       <para>
        We now find that this Parliament once again is making decisions for the residents of Canberra, completely disregarding strongly held views in this community. Canberra has been the envy of other States in relation to road safety standards. Up to now we have had an effective independent vehicle inspection system, free of the problems experienced in other States where there can be a conflict of interest when local garages do inspections. The cost to the motorist must also be considered. Currently, Canberra motorists pay $213 a year to register their cars, irrespective of engine capacity, and $238 if it is a new registration. We find in the Budget estimates that these charges are about to be increased again, despite the fact that the independent inspection of vehicles will no longer be carried out. The Minister has been unable to provide us with the cost of the inspection component in the registration. He has also been unable or unwilling to reduce registration fees by the amount of the inspection component when this service is finally removed. Not only are Canberra motorists facing high registration charges, which are about to be increased, according to the Budget, but also we now find that on top of this we will have to pay $25 or $30 to a local garage to get an annual inspection carried out. Local garages do not have the specialised equipment or staff to do this properly. This will mean that Canberra motorists will pay the highest registration fees in Australia but at the same time will have lost the services of independent vehicle inspectors. We are facing a serious erosion of public safety standards as a result of this short-sighted decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        We also find that the Bills before us will tax Canberra motorists even further. The Canberra community has borne the brunt of poorly conceived government decisions this year, both in the razor gang report and in the Budget. The transfer of the motor vehicle inspection functions to the private sector is one of the worst of these decisions. I urge that this decision be reviewed in the interests of public safety and in response to the wishes of the Canberra community.
       </para>
       <para>
        The revenue to be raised from the new vehicle tax is considerable. Last year there were approximately 20,000 new or transferred registrations. The revenue from the new tax, at approximately $100 a vehicle, will be at least $2m a year. This money will be incorporated into Consolidated Revenue. There has been no guarantee that it will be returned to the Australian Capital Territory in the form of increased services or, more particularly, applied to the promotion of improved public safety standards. The Australian Labor Party position on this matter is clear. We do not believe that there should be any new taxes imposed on Canberra residents until a full investigation of the financial situation of the Australian Capital Territory is undertaken by the Grants Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of the insurance Bills, the amount of revenue to be collected is enormous. Under the new provisions tax will be imposed on insurance premiums received in the Australian Capital Territory. Whilst the Bureau of Statistics figures available do not provide a detailed break-down of the various categories of insurance, we can get a general idea of the amount of revenue to be collected. In 1980, $162.3m in premiums was collected in the Australian Capital Territory. If tax were applied at 7 per cent, this would generate $11.4m in revenue. These taxes, along with those collected from the vehicle registration Bills, will go straight into Consolidated Revenue. Canberra is being taxed heavily but there is no accountability to the residents as to how their money is spent.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to the Australian Capital Territory Budget figures, $23m is collected from the rent on government housing. Where does this money go? Is it disbursed back to the Australian Capital Territory in improved services? We do not know because there are no clear financial arrangements for the Australian Capital Territory. These are only just some of the examples. Canberra residents have had to fight hard to get the ordinary concessions that apply, for example, to pensioners in other States. Again, if we pay the same taxes and the same levies as people in the States, we should get the benefits. Every time people here want a benefit they have to fight for it. I refer to a matter with which I was involved, getting electricity concessions for pensioners. We fought for that for two years. We got it. It was a promise by this Government in the last election. I am pleased to see that that has now come into effect. The sorts of battles that we have to put up every time we want to get these rights I believe should not have to happen. In this Budget I am pleased to see that we have special concessions for age pensioners in the motor vehicle registration area. But as I highlighted yesterday-I hope the Minister has taken note of this-certain categories of age pensioners now administered through the Department of Veterans' Affairs have been excluded. I hope that the Minister will refer to that matter when replying because I believe that those general categories of age pensoners should be taken into consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        These decisions on municipal benefits for Canberra citizens are made by Cabinet, not by a local representative administration. We are still well behind the States in the provision of transport concessions for our pensioners. These issues are properly the concern of the local community and should not have to be a subject on the agenda of the national Government. We can see how many people are really interested in this Parliament by the number of people here today. But it is a matter that really dramaticaly concerns the people in my electorate, the people of the Australian Capital Territory. It is a matter for their elected representatives. However, it will be essential to have all the information on the Australian Capital Territory's finances in order to have a sound basis for the extension of local services and concessions.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is apparent that the decision to transfer the functions of land development to the private sector has been made without any analysis of the implications for the financial basis of a future local government. Until now profits from the sale of land leases, both commercial and residential, have been absorbed into Consolidated Revenue. Under the new arrangements whereby the private sector takes over land development, profits will be accumulated in private hands and will be unavailable for disbursement in the form of improved municipal services. Further, it is clear that Canberra home buyers will be paying higher prices for their homes as a result of this transfer of a Commonwealth function. This is a recurring pattern in recent Government decisions imposed on the people of Canberra. Higher charges, prices and taxes are being imposed while, at the same time, the Government stalls on the question of a full investigation of the financial arrangements for the Australian Capital Territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1931-I repeat that for the Minister's attention; in 1931-the Federal Capital Advisory Council asked the Federal Government to give a detailed report on the financial arrangements for Canberra. Fifty years later we are still waiting. What we want from the Minister is some action on it. The Government is still trying to fob off the residents of Canberra. It is not prepared to give them an honest answer about the funds spent on national and municipal functions. I would like the Minister to stand up and tell us, not that it is going to the Grants Commission at some time in the future, but when it is going to the Grants Commission. I would like him to tell us when we will have answers to the questions I have put to him today. If we have to pay the same taxes we want the same rights. I do not think that is too much to ask for the people of the Australian Capital Territory. I believe it is his reponsibility to try to provide answers to those questions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, the Grants Commission inquiry into the Australian Capital Territory finances can provide the answers. I hope that it can provide all the answers but answers to some questions, at least, will be a start. But the Government has to give the Grants Commission a reference before further taxes and charges are imposed on the Canberra people. I urge all members to support the amendment, which will provide for a full investigation of the financial arrangements for the Australian Capital Territory and will give the people a fair go. We want to be treated equally. I hope that a first step towards equal treatment will be an immediate reference to the Grants Commission.

         —I congratulate the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) on her spirited address. But may I take one or two moments to correct a couple of matters. As much as I might wish to have control of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, the honourable member will find, if she checks, that the Commission operates under the purview and portfolio of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman). I have made representations to the Minister. Indeed, the honourable member knows this. She pays me the greatest compliment of my political life by virtually implying that I have a capacity, almost overnight, to resolve an issue that has been rampant in the Australian Capital Territory since 1931. I reminded the honourable member in an earlier debate that in 1931 two things happened. Firstly, there was a request for a review of the finances of the Australian Capital Territory with a division between national capital expenditure and municipal expenditure. Secondly, a Labor government at that time told the people of the Australian Capital Territory that they would have self-government within one year. I make the comment in passing that the question of self-government, the question of representation and the question of taxation have been current issues in the Australian Capital Territory for at least the last decade, but one could even go back for 50 years. The honourable member's party, the Australian Labor Party, made a firm commitment prior to the 1972 Federal election to give self-government to the Australian Capital Territory. Three years later self-government had not come about. In 1981, whilst I am delighted that the attitude of the honourable member is somewhat different from that of some others in her party, there is an approach in respect of self-government which I hope will be fruitful.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        With the geatest of respect to the Opposition, the amendment is not acceptable to the Government. It does not advance the issue. The fact is that the review which has been promised will occur. It is not years down the track, as was suggested by another honourable member last week. The review is only months down the track. The Commonwealth Grants Commission is currently undertaking the review of State relativities. I have every reason to believe that as soon as that relativities review is completed the Australian Capital Territory matter will be the next reference to it. But I must add one further comment on behalf of the Chairman of the Grants Commission, Mr Justice Else-Mitchell, and the hard working members of the Commission. I do not think anyone would disagree with me when I say that the Commission is overworked and is under-resourced. It is a matter of ordinary, plain common sense that applying oneself as the Commission does and as the Chairman, in particular, does to the very onerous duties upon them, there is a limit to what can be done and the time in which it can be done. Having said that, I repeat that it is my belief-it is a belief which I state quite responsibly-that the review will occur in 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are three expenditure aspects. There is the national capital component of expenditure in the Australian Capital Territory, there is the State-type expenditure and there is the municipal-type expenditure. It is a matter of conjecture where those figures will come out in the ultimate. Whilst the honourable member says that we would like the 2 per cent of personal income tax collections for municipal services, that request might be quickly withdrawn if the figures showed that 2 per cent of personal income tax would represent about 60 per cent of the current revenues being made available. In other words, we are a little in the dark. The suggestion of 2 per cent, I think, is not likely to be picked up until people have a few more figures down the track. There is no $6.8m surplus in the municipal account. I again invite the honourable member, if she does not understand, to take the matter up again with the Secretary to my Department or, if she wishes, we can have a full scale debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I take the point of the honourable member in relation to motor vehicle testing. I will convey her remarks to ministerial collegues. It is simply not correct to say that the matter is not subject to review. If, for example, an ordinance has to be amended, it will be very much subject to review by comment both in the House of Assembly and in another place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Lastly, I ask the honourable member in an absolute spirit of friendship and co-operation not to jump up and down on the question of land development. This is a golden opportunity for the private sector to put its money into the national capital and to make a contribution to the economy, which desperately needs the input of private enterprise. I invite the honourable member to attend to the details, while admiring the spirit with which she puts her case on behalf of her constituents.

         —To their eternal shame Government members in this House, who are here purely to represent and to protect the people who elected them, are gearing up to use their numbers to support a Budget which again, following the infamous razor gang cuts, hits at the weakest in the community. During my time in this Parliament I have watched the Government as it tries to anaesthetise the community with its mumbo jumbo inside this chamber and out. Those on lowest incomes have been hurt so badly that nothing can kill the pain. While Australians are told that they have to be content with just the crumbs the Government trumpets to the rest of the world what a prize, resource-rich plum we are, ripe for the picking-a lucky country. It all too often seems that the rest of the world gets the plum and Australians are left with the pip. How long will it be before the Government understands that average Australian workers are not wanting more of the national cake; they are just wanting to maintain the same portion?

       <para>
        The Government has used and abused the so-called boom. At election times Government politicians puff up with rhetoric about the boom; after the election they lower the boom in no uncertain fashion. The myopic commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to the pursuit of monetarist policies at any price is now firmly established and evidenced in this Budget. The price for that ideological commitment is also abundantly clear-the people are the ones who will be paying. They will be paying cruelly for the ideological servitude of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to his master and benefactor, the Prime Minister. The victims of this Budget will be the people who can least afford to pay. As the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) has already said in this House the Government does not apply the principle of the user pays; the principle is the loser pays. The loser for the past six years and again this year are the pensioners, the sick, the unemployed, particularly the young unemployed, home owners and those who wish to buy their own homes, the average family, supporting parents, small businessmen-every Australian on low and middle income levels-and, of course, the retailer who now becomes the Government's tax collector for its billion dollar sales tax scandal.
       </para>
       <para>
        One cannot isolate the effects, the flow on, of this tax. It is paid irrespective of one's taxable capacity or means, and nothing, save perhaps the Bible, seems to have escaped the sales tax net. There is a growing list of organisations and people who could normally have been expected to be Government supporters but who have given up whatever confidence they might have had in this Government. Take note of the Queensland Premier, the Queensland Liberal Party leader, the Liberal Party Premier of Western Australia, the Victorian Liberal Party Minister of Housing; note even the honourable member for Kooyong who has shown us that birds of a feather do not necessarily flock together. Who else apart from the ordinary Australian worker has criticised this Budget? It is a very impressive list; it does not just come from Opposition ranks. It includes the Master Builders Association, the Bank of New South Wales, the Australian Automobile Association, the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, the Australian Taxpayers Association, CRS, the Confederation of Australian Industry and Mr Kerry Packer. The executive director of the Housing Industry Association, Mr Bill Kirkby-Jones, said that the industry regarded the sales tax increase as the 'final straw'. The President of the Master Builders Association said that the tax 'would spell disaster' for many home seekers. A statement released from a meeting of leading executives of Alcoa of Australia Ltd, James Hardie and Co. Pty Ltd, the Stegbar organisation, Australian Consolidated Industries Ltd, Taubmans Industries Ltd, Berger Paints (Australia) Pty Ltd, CRS, Monier Ltd, Ready Mixed Concrete Ltd, John Lysaght Australia Ltd, and Rheem Australia Ltd reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        Decent housing underpins the social fabric of this country and we will not allow it to be eroded. Quite apart from the attack on the living standards and housing aspirations of ordinary Australians, the penalty, if allowed to stand, will lead to further unemployment in an industry which is presently facing serious difficulty.
       </para>
       <para>
        I quote that article from the Australian of 29-30 August. The number of homes built last year fell by almost 5,000, and it does not take a prophet to forecast a further fall this year. If ever there were a Budget specifically designed to end the Australian ownership dream this is it. Not only will the increase in sales tax add to the cost of homes and renovations but also the credit squeeze which has been applied and the Government's glaring and deliberate failure to stop the inflow of speculative foreign capital and its refusal to ease the pressure on or regulate interest rates or make home loan interest repayments tax deductible will ensure that the climate for borrowing for home loans becomes chillier and chillier and the obligation of loan repayments becomes harder and harder. This sacrifice need not have been made because the policy direction of the Government is all wrong. It seems that the Government's money supply strategy is predicated on the disputable theory that scarce money will compel employers to resist employees' wages demands. Of course, anyone with an element of common sense could explain to the Government that, by its very nature, the Budget compels workers to seek wage increases to redress the fall in living standards represented by this Budget. An average family of four is worse off by approximately $20 a week as a result of this Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from the inflationary and regressive sales tax, what are the other features of this year's Budget strategy? Payments to the States are up 7.7 per cent. It is very little wonder that the Queensland Premier's spouse in the Senate has had a few cross words to say about that. The figure of 7.7 per cent compares with an expected double digit inflation figure for the coming year, an 18.9 per cent increase in personal income tax collections and an overall increase of 15.2 per cent in Commonwealth expenditure. Unemployment is expected to rise as a direct result of the Budget strategy. This has been admitted by the Treasurer himself. Offsetting this, the Government has announced an increase of $4.65 a week in unemployment benefit. That is on a par with inflation, which leaves people receiving that benefit as far below the poverty line as they were before. It is unforgivable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Meanwhile, of course, the under 18-year-olds remain on $36 a week-a full $50 under the poverty line-which will lead inevitably to an increase in youth crime and youth homelessness, which is a blot on our society as it is. The Victorian Liberal Party Minister for Youth, Sport and Recreation said the very same thing the week before the Budget. Apparently his advice fell on deaf ears. There are 53,000 people in the under 18 category. This is not just a figure; there are 53,000 young people without jobs. Not only was there no increase in benefit for them but also, to its eternal shame, the Government has cut the only real, tangible, direct and effective unemployed youth support program that it had-the Community Youth Support Scheme. It was small-minded and criminally amateurish for a Government with a $1,542m domestic surplus this year to scrap a paltry, in money terms, $14m program which helped some of the most defenceless people in the community-the young unemployed. The money allocated to the Community Youth Support Scheme was arguably the best $14m the Government has ever spent.

         —As the honourable member says, it is better than the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Now for the good news: After five barren years without a rise the Government will be increasing family allowances but the increase is for a third child and later children only which, in fact, means no increase at all for more than 70 per cent of Australian families. I hardly think that parents of one or two children rushed to the bedroom the moment they heard the Budget news to cash in, as it were, on the Treasurer's little bonus. With the birth rate declining and the trend to smaller families this must be seen in the naked light of day for what it really is-a confidence trick. So much for the good news on family allowances! What about the good news on pensions? About the only thing that can be said is that supplementary or rent assistance will be increased by $3 to $8 a week, and even that is not all that it seems. Everyone in this chamber can imagine going out with $8 in his hand and hoping to get even the most meagre type of accommodation. True to its form of giving with one hand and taking with the other, the Government has established a minimum rent for which assistance will be payable. This maginificent supplementary assistance was the one gift the Government had for pensioners this year. That is how barren it is. Pensions as a proportion of average weekly earnings will fall one per cent below last year. When the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) said that the Government was maintaining a steady course, he was dead right. The Government is steadily undermining pensioners. What else will the Department of Social Security be doing as a result of the Budget? The Government will penalise the spouse and children of a person engaged in an industrial dispute by rendering the spouse ineligible for unemployment benefit. That is another fine example of the Government's respect for families. It is a sad irony that the Department charged with maintaining social security should be responsible for creating so much social insecurity.

        The patient contribution to pharmaceutical benefits scheme drugs has increased by 113 per cent since 1975. The Government has increased the price of oral contraceptives at a time when the allocation to the Family Planning Association of Australia has fallen by 10 per cent. It is illogical. Families will pay $2 to $11 extra per week for compulsory health insurance. Expenditure on job training schemes has fallen 44 per cent below the 1975-76 expenditure in real terms yet, as we all know, unemployment has risen by 54 per cent in the same period. There has been no increase in Aboriginal affairs expenditure, and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) would have expanded on that issue yesterday if he had not been gagged by the Government during Question Time. In that disgraceful abuse of Government numbers, justice was really miscarried.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other areas have suffered under this Budget. Environment and conservation expenditure has been cut by 17 per cent in real terms; roads expenditure has been cut; tourism has been cut by 35 per cent in real terms; spending on migrant programs has been cut at a time when immigration will be increasing; air navigation charges are up, which means air fares will increase; urban and regional development spending has plummeted by 28.3 per cent; the Commonwealth Public Service has been cut by another 9,000; health expenditure is down by 21.3 per cent, as indicated in Budget outlays, and the burden for hospital funding has been dumped unsolicited on the State governments. The only thing going up is the cost of living. At a time when people are struggling to manage, we have a Government which cynically cuts any benefits going back to the public which elected it.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worth noting that in the International Year of Disabled Persons, when one might expect at least a few generous gestures from the Government, there has been no increase in the handicapped children's allowance. It is a farce. There are 25,371 people in that category. The sheltered workshop employees' incentive allowance, after having remained at the same pitiful level for six years, has been boosted by the awesome amount of $3. This entire allowance costs a crippling $1.4m. The Government really makes Scrooge look like Santa Clause. The promised $225m three-year housing program is $110m less in real terms than the previous program. At a time when the percentage of senior citizens has grown within our community and their housing needs are expanding, the Government is reducing the supply of public housing. For those few who are lucky enough to score public housing, future supplementary assistance will be abolished. The same illogical response is indicated in the Government's commitment to senior citizens' centres. The allocation has remained static at $4m for the last five years. Who else in the community would put up with having his income pegged? Certainly no one in this chamber. Surely I need not explain to Government members that that is a fall in real terms of the order of 60 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The personal care subsidy paid towards facilities for the frail aged in hostels has not been increased from $20 a week to the $32.50 a week recommended by the joint working party on hostel accommodation. The subsidy to Meals on Wheels has not beein increased, despite that voluntary association's invaluable service in the face of inflationary costs. The home care subsidy has been reduced from $2 for $1 to $1 for $1. This places an intolerable burden on State and local government, church and voluntary agencies to fill the gap. This year's children's services program has fallen by $20m in real terms below 1975-76 spending levels. Of course, it does not matter for how long we search in the Budget for a reference to women's refuges. The fact is that they are not there because the razor gang recommended them as one of the gifts the Federal Government should hand quite gratuitously to the States. Fraser co-operative federalism, as it is sometimes called, means that the Federal Government leaves the baby on the doorstep of the State governments. If those State governments do not have room for any more Federal babies, they are entirely abandoned. The Community Youth Support Scheme is the latest baby conceived and raised by the Federal Government to be so abandoned. In education, which is another crucial area the importance of which the Federal Minister for Education (Mr Fife) just does not comprehend, the total funding will be cut in 1982 from $452m to $479m, or by more than 10 per cent in real terms.

        How does this Budget add to the impressive list of broken promises which constitute the record of this Government? Employment will fall this year, but last year, the election year, we were told that the Government's policies and the boom would strengthen the labour market. We cannot believe a word the Government says. Interest rates are soaring through the roof, but it was not long ago that the Prime Minister said that they would fall and keep on falling. That prediction might better apply to him. What about the total abandonment of the fundamental 1975 and 1977 election promise of tax idexation? We now have one-third indexation. Of course, the promise to retain Medibank was broken long agon into a thousand pieces. Where in the Prime Minister's 1980 election speech, was the Government's request to the Australian people for a mandate to increase sales tax? Much was made during that campaign of the Opposition's capital gains and resource tax proposals which we frankly acknowledged and which the Government distorted to cause unfounded fear. The Government's decision to increase the amount of sales tax revenue by almost $1 billion must have been written in the policy speech between the lines and in invisible ink.
       </para>

        How do Government members rationalise the real increase in Government spending when they were pledged to reduce it? Spending is a flat rate of 13 per cent above that of last year. What about the myth of the low tax, low profile Liberal Government? Not only will this Government rip off more in income tax, but also every time a consumer enters a hardware store, a camera store, a clothes shop, a shoe store or a furniture store the Government tax collector will be waiting to relieve his pockets of hard earned cash by way of this deceitful indirect impost of sales tax.

I am fed up with a government which is here to represent the people continually trampling on those people. The new sales tax which has been imposed has put into the luxury class many items which people on lower incomes are forced to go along with and support with their money. The Government is putting a sales tax on the woman who stays at home, struggling on one income to rear her family. Her husband has to put his hand in his pocket to pay the extra tax every time she wants to wash the dishes with detergent or wipe the dishes with a teatowel. The same situation applies if she is an income earner and perhaps can afford a dish washing machine. Items which are essential to everyone, including the poor, have been attacked by the Government through the sales tax.

The Australian community will be greatly reassured to know that the parts of movable toilet pans or chemical sanitary units will now receive exemption status, although the toilet pan, seat and cover will be taxed.

         —I support the Government in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1981-82. The honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) who spoke before me finished her speech by quoting Shakespeare. She said 'performance is nothing'. I would say that that applies to her speech. With the greatest of respect, she put her heart on her sleeve and criticised the Government for the expenditure cuts it had made and the new programs it had introduced. We did not hear from the honourable member one positive idea or solution to the problems that Australia faces today. That goes for the Opposition overall. There is always negativism. We never see anything positive. We never see any progress or thought for the future. I am convinced, after listening to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) speak on the Budget, that the Labor Party certainly has not learned the lessons of its past period in office when unemployment, inflation and taxes rose dramatically. If the Australian Labor Party-heaven forbid-were ever to govern again that would happen again. The Labor Party is committed to big spending and big deficits. It lacks ideas about how to control inflation and promote sensible and sustained economic growth. It believes that government can run people's lives and industry better than people can organise their own lives and better than industry can conduct its own affairs. I am confident that in the future the majority of Australians will reject that socialist approach.

        From listening to the honourable member for Lilley one would hardly think that the Government had done anything previously. We need to refer to the Budget to remind honourable members opposite of what the Government has done. It has a most creditable record of its concern and help for people. Social security and welfare outlays, the largest single item in the Budget, account for almost 28 per cent of government expenditure. They are estimated to be $11,357m, an increase of 14.5 per cent. To listen to honourable members opposite speak one would think that we had not spent anything at all on social security and welfare. We have increased family allowances for the third and fourth child.

We get no credit for that from honourable members opposite. We get no credit for the $12m increase in expenditure, to $58m, for aged persons accommodation. We get no credit for the increase of $2m in expenditure on crisis accommodation which will start a program for families in distress. We get no credit from the opposition for the increase in unemployment benefit for people aged 18 years and over without dependants. That benefit will be increased from $53.45 to $58.10 a week from November.

        I now turn my attention and the attention of the House to the record of this Government. Whilst the Budget document is looking forward to the future, let us reflect for a second on the past and the very creditable record of the Government. In 1980-81 private business fixed investment grew by more than 20 per cent in real terms. That is the largest growth for 30 years. It was a creditable performance. In the same year private dwelling investment continued to grow firmly with a real increase of about 11 per cent. That was a magnificent achievement. People who are criticising the Government at present about interest rates and the problems that people face in relation to welfare housing and in the purchasing of new homes fail to recognise the excellent performance of the Government in this area. I refer to the Government's performance in controlling inflation. As measured by the CPI, last year the inflation rate was 8.8 per cent-almost 2 per cent below the rate of the previous year. That is creditable. Average weekly earnings in the last financial year achieved the largest increase in real terms for six years-almost 4 per cent. We never hear Opposition members citing those figures or giving the Government any credit for its excellent performance. I have set the stage by dealing with the Government's performance in the past. It has made substantial economic progress. That does not mean that there are no problems to be solved in the community today. We are not denying that there are problems. Of course there are. We are applying our policies in a most sensible way to solve them. I welcome in the Budget the move to indirect taxation by the imposition of sales tax.

         —The honourable member for Perth said that the Labor Government did nothing in office. It did nothing at all. Let us not forget that the Liberal-National Country Party coalition has done more to stop tax avoidance than any other government in the history of Australia. We have now taxed the cash economy. We all know that there is an underground cash economy in Australia. The imposition of sales tax has meant that we are taxing transactions in the community. The Government has made an excellent move in that direction. I personally would have liked to see a tax at the retail level. I feel that manufacturers and wholesalers in large part act as the tax collectors and have to fund the revenue. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know the sales tax Acts provide that sales tax has to be paid within 21 days. That was all very well in the days when sales tax Acts were first enacted. People probably paid their accounts within that time. Today people pay within 30 days, 60 days and even up to 90 days. At some stage the Treasurer (Mr Howard) ought to consider extending the time of 21 days for payment for manufacturers and wholesalers. He also ought to look at the added burden being put on wholesalers and manufacturers in having to pay extra staff in some cases to administer the collection and payment of sales tax. I hope he will instruct the sales tax department to be as helpful as possible to those who have to pay the tax.

        There are obvious difficulties in planning the implementation of sales tax in a Budget context. The more a government plans, the more people know, and the more chances there are of a Budget leak and the secrecy of the Budget being broken. There are a number of anomalies. I mentioned in the House the other day the problems that the Kit Kat and other chocolate biscuits and confectionery involve. In the construction industry where sand, gravel and other items are used it is hard to know whether the end use is exempt from taxation. Some discretion and good will should be used on behalf of the Commissioner of Taxation in administering the new legislation. I hope that in considering the legislation some of the anomalies will be worked out before it is in place.

        I now refer to the Community Youth Support Scheme. The honourable member for Lilley and other Opposition members have criticised the Government; they say that it is being heartless in relation to unemployed youth. It is completely hypocritical for honourable members opposite to criticise the Government in relation to the Community Youth Support Scheme. I remind this House and honourable members present today that when CYSS was introduced the Labor Party was critical of it. I think it called the scheme cuddle therapy.

         —That is on the record. The Labor Party was against the Community Youth Support Scheme when it was introduced. Members of the Labor Party realise that it was an initiative of the Government but for narrow political advantage they refuse to recognise that we have increased expenditure by 23 per cent in the employment and training area for young people. They fail to recognise the new programs which have been put in place. There is a 67 per cent increase in the school to work transition scheme for young people. But not a word of that do we hear from members of the Opposition. Are they trying to say that we do not care about young people? How can a government be accused of not caring if it increases expenditure by 23 per cent overall? As I say, in the school to work transition area, that very important time for people in the youth training area, we have increased expenditure by 67 per cent. Yet members of the Opposition have the hide to get up in this chamber and say that we do not care about young people. I am pleased to say that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) has said that he has an open mind in relation to Community Youth Support Scheme projects and that if, because of geographic location, people are unable to attend these projects, or if people currently participating in those projects are unsuited to the new training schemes or the expanded training schemes, he will develop new programs to meet those needs.

I am confident that, at the end of the day, those few people who are unable to take part in the new expanded program will have their needs met by this Government. I stand here and say that quite firmly and proudly. I think I have the support of my colleague the honourable member for Perth (Mr McLean) when I say that at the end of the day, when all the kerfuffle has died down and the Opposition has stopped screaming and stopped failing to recognise what the Government has done, the positive initiatives which have been taken, better schemes will be in place and young people will be much better off.

        I move on to the area of taxation. One of the concerns I have about the Budget is that it is still, I think, a big government Budget. I take the view that no person should have to pay more than 50 per cent of his or her earnings in taxation. I give the Government credit for cutting the rate of growth of government expenditure but we still have to bite the bullet of where we cut programs. In the community today there are great demands on government. People want the Government to do this or that. They ask why the Government has not done this or that. On the other hand, there is a great demand for and a need to reduce taxation. When people come to me with an idea about government involvement and say that the Government ought to do this or that, I say to them, as I say to the House today: 'Please tell me where you want to increase the taxation to pay for that program or where you want to cut government expenditure to pay for that program'. We cannot have new government programs without either raising taxation or cutting expenditure. People like the honourable member for Lilley fail to recognise that fact. I think that is perhaps a weakness of this Budget. There is still too large a commitment to big government and to the public sector. I would like to see government expenditure cut. Similarly, I am disappointed that we did not cut that expenditure so that we could give some tax relief because I believe tax relief is urgently required in the community today. But I want to give credit to the Government-we never get credit-for the substantial changes it has made to the personal taxation system. It introduced the three-tier, the three steps, collection system, yet it gets no credit for doing so. We have made credible advances in the area of taxation relief but I believe we still have a long way to go.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now address myself briefly to the area of wage demands. I think the Budget is predicated on an approximately 13 1/2 per cent increase in wages. I am confident that that will prove to be an over-exaggerated figure. I have confidence in the arbitration system and in the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I think we have to look to the Commission. There were a lot of newspaper headlines and hoo-ha when indexation was abandoned by the Commission. People in the media were saying: 'Oh, look, there is no indexation. The arbitration system has broken down. What will we do?'. We have the Arbitration Commission in place. We have respected judges and respected commissioners on that Commission. The Commission still sits. It is still working. It is still functioning. It is still hearing cases. Under the relevant Act it has to take into account the effects on employment and inflation of its decisions. We are going through a new stage of decision making by the Commission. I believe it is successful. In fact, I am very optimistic that wage increases will be held down during the next financial year. That, of course, will affect the Government's Budget figure and will affect inflation. It will reduce inflation. I think all of us on both sides of the House have to back up the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It is working well. Let us look at what is happening in the market place. The demand for an extra $20 that the transport workers were seeking by strike action has not flowed on throughout the community. Where it has flowed on, it has been handed to workers under terms and conditions; it is to be used as a credit for any subsequent increase that is granted. I think we are entering a new era of restraint and sensibility in relation to wage increases in the community. In so saying, I pay some credit to the Australian Council of Trade Unions in that regard. It may surprise some honourable members opposite that I am prepared to do so.

         —We can only hope, can we not? We have been criticised in relation to rising interest rates in the community. I was delighted this morning to hear the Treasurer (Mr Howard) say that he thought we had started to turn the interest rate corner and that there had been some promising signs in the government bond market. Let us look at the question of interest rates. It is of concern to me and to other honourable members on this side of the House that interest rates are inhibiting people from buying their own homes or are adding to the costs of people who are buying their own homes. But let us give the Budget a fair go. Let us give it a chance to work. Last year we had an excellent figure for private dwelling investment. Such investment is increasing. If interest rates can be moderated and can turn the corner, if we can get them on the downward path, we can restore people's ability to finance their home purchases.

        We have budgeted for a domestic surplus. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that means that the Government is not going out to compete in the market place with the private sector for money. We are trying to give the private sector room to breathe. Money, like any other commodity, reacts to supply and demand. The greater the demand for money in the community, the higher the interest rate. That is the reason for the Government's high domestic surplus and I believe this strategy has to be given a chance to work. It is silly and futile for honourable members opposite to get up and say: 'You have a $1.5 billion surplus; give some of it here and put some of it there'. I point out to the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) that every bit of that surplus that is taken away adds to interest rate pressure. So every time the Opposition says that we should use some of that domestic surplus in an area of expenditure it is in fact advocating higher interest rates for home owners. I think that fact ought to be recognised and pointed out. I think we have to recognise also that this Budget is another Budget for economic growth, another Budget that is healthy for the Australian economy. I am delighted to speak to it today. I am pleased to be able to support it, and I will vote for it and work for it in every way possible.

        These strident remarks are a desperate attempt to cling at straws in the face of overwhelming evidence that Fraserism has been a total failure. In this speech, I hope to demonstrate that there is indeed a clear and coherent philosophical alternative to Fraserism, which presents a vision of a much better society. This rejects the need for widespread human suffering and a culture of gloom and despair, as embodied in this Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        But first I want to expose a remarkable act of sophistry by the Australian newspaper. It does not deny that Fraserism in practice has been a serious failure. Indeed the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is attacked in the same editorial for being 'a big taxer and spender'. The problem, we are told, is that for six years the Prime Minister has not practised Fraserism-and if only he would, our problems would be solved. The common man, the average Australian, is suffering reduced living standards and oppression as a result of the policies of the Prime Minister which continue to be reflected in this Budget as in every previous Fraser Budget.

         —Now it is very little consolation to this average Australian, to workers and their families, to be told that the gospel according to St Malcolm is actually correct, even if he does not practise it himself. One can understand the feelings of ordinary people when they treat such a suggestion with contempt. And in so doing they would be right. For how can Fraserism be divorced from the policies and actions of the man who pompously claims to have formulated that so-called philosophy. In my maiden speech earlier this year, I argued that the Prime Minister is using talk of liberal principles and social justice but that his real purpose and real philosophy are entirely different. This unstated real philosophy is consistent with this Goverment's actions and policies.

       <para>
        But look at its consequences. They have been devastating for this nation and its people. The real Fraser philosophy is based on dividing this nation between the rich and the poor, the privileged and the oppressed. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) pointed out in his Budget reply, the Government will collect record taxes from the Australian people of $37,769m. Yet spending in all the major areas of need has been reduced in real terms since 1975; in education, health, transport, communications and housing. Urban and regional development is down 89 per cent. At the same time, grants and concessions to big business are up 56 per cent to $1,000m. In view of this situation, how can rational people-I include the editors of the Australian here- defend the real philosophy of Fraserism?
       </para>
       <para>
        In earlier speeches on this Budget my Labor colleagues have analysed in great detail the detrimental consequences of this Budget on the Australian people and the inhumane values on which it is based. Their criticisms have been echoed by millions of people in this nation, the big majority of whom are opposed to this Government and its policies. Indeed, a national survey in Monday's Age shows that 73 per cent of Australians believe that they will be worse off with the Federal Budget and only 2 per cent believe that they will be even a little better off. So much for the claim that the Government's Budget fulfils the aspirations of Australian society today.

         —That is true. The Prime Minister's friends will be better off. Nevertheless there is something in the challenge which the Australian newspaper has thrown out with its claim that there is no alternative to neo-conservative philosophies such as Fraserism. This is because the economic and social problems which we face in Australia are fundamental and the challenge before us is a serious one. It was raised succinctly in an editorial on the Budget in the Canberra Times of Saturday 29 August, entitled 'What Has Gone Wrong?' The newspaper asks how is it that one in five Australians are living in poverty. The editorial states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Two thoughts immediately suggest themselves. The first is that there may be a great deal more hardship and poverty in Australia now than there was 10 years ago. The second is that much of the government spending that has occurred in the interim has been misdirected or, alternatively-dare it be said?-that the public sector's spending as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product should be even higher to accommodate greater social security and social welfare spending . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        That probably is the most pertinent question that could be asked after Australia's experience during the past decade, for it encompasses the debate about the size of the public sector, the relative importance of traditional monetary and fiscal policies compared with incomes policies, and the debate about who is going to benefit from the resources boom. And until it is answered properly, and the implications of the answer understood, the lessons of the 1970s will remain unlearnt, the mistakes are likely to be repeated, and their damaging and divisive effects on Australians will be compounded to the diminution of all of us.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is clear, that a new philosophy needs to be articulated in these depressed times when the Liberal Government has squeezed every ounce of hope from the people of this nation. This philosophy presents vision of a new future and a much better society for ourselves and our children. This philosophy is the new democratic socialism. It is the philosophy which, with increasing momentum, is being articulated from within the Australian Labor Party and in the democratic socialist parties throughout the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are four major features which this democratic socialism would embody within the Australian context: First, a war against poverty in order to achieve a more equitable distribution of wealth; secondly, a substantial expansion in the provision of services to the people through the public and communal sectors of the economy; thirdly, a complete overhaul of the taxation system to make it more progressive and to include the introduction of a capital gains tax; and, fourthly, a substantial extension of public ownership in the economy, including especially the introduction of enterprises jointly owned by the public and private sectors.
       </para>
       <para>
        I proceed now to outline these features in more detail and some of the concrete reforms necessary to implement them. First, a continuous war against poverty aiming to wipe out the ugly phenomenon referred to in the editorial from which I have quoted. This poverty is especially serious for our Aboriginal people and we stand condemned in the eyes of the world for it. But it is also present, in a less obvious yet insidious fashion, in our big cities and towns. The cause of this poverty is, firstly, the blatantly unjust and unequal distribution of wealth in this country and, secondly, the continuous plundering of the wealth of this nation by foreign interests, especially the foreign corporations. A war against poverty thus requires a struggle for a more equal distribution of the nation's wealth and an immediate end to the traitorous rip-off of Australia's resources by foreign interests. Such a war against poverty is not only the task of the Australian Labor Party; it is the duty of all Australians who believe in social justice, including all those who call themselves Christians. They must stand up and be counted. They must resist the Fraser Government's continuous attempts to make the rich richer at the expense of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people. They must also work for, and help achieve, the substantial and fundamental reforms which will be necessary if this war against poverty is to be won. Reform policies for the alleviation of poverty must be based on the recognition that the social security system in itself has not succeeded in resolving the problem. This is so notwithstanding the increase in total outlays for social security from 14.3 per cent of the Budget in 1969-70 to 24.7 per cent in 1979-80. I ask leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard figures provided by Dr Manning of Melbourne University.

         —I thank the House. These figures contrast the actual payout in social security for 1979-80 with that predicted a decade ago. Three figures stand out here. Age and service pensions were predicted to be $2,241m but were actually $4,034m, nearly double. This was not just due to the increase in payments in real terms which occurred during the term of the Whitlam Labor Government. The figures also reflect the fact that Australia has an aging population, with a greater proportion of persons in this category.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        On the other hand, child endowments and family allowances were $470m less than predicted, that is, reduced by 35 per cent. This reflects the Government's policies of reducing allowances in real terms. Third and most important, the predicted figure for unemployment benefits was for only $70m. The actual figure was $1,105m, a rise of over 1,000 per cent. This, of course, reflects the dramatic increase in the number of unemployed persons over the decade. Furthermore, and very significantly, if one discounts the increases above the expected level for unemployment and old age recipients, which total $2,828m, we see that this accounts for almost all of the increases beyond the predicted level. So much then for the claim that the Government is being much more generous with its social security dollars now than it was 10 years ago. The increased spending was forced on it because, through bad policies, many more people are receiving benefits than was originally predicted. Yet, the level of benefits remains well below the Henderson poverty line, especially for those on unemployment benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        What of solutions? As Professor Henderson remarked years ago, a war on poverty requires that all persons receive a guaranteed minimum income to at least the poverty line. This can be done by either a negative income tax or by increasing social security benefits to that level. The method is not of immediate importance; it is the result which counts, that is, ensuring that all persons have a minimum income to provide those things which they must buy through the market economy. But while such a guaranteed income for all people is a necessary condition for eradicating poverty, it is not in itself sufficient, for it needs to be supplemented by the provision of a large number of services through the public sector. There are two kinds of services which are necessary here: Those which are provided for the specially disadvantaged, such as the handicapped and the chronically ill, and those which are provided universally to all. The extension of this latter group of services is an essential feature of socialist philosophy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second feature is a large increase in the number of services provided to the people through a reorganised and revitalised public sector of the economy. The provision of services in education, health, welfare and the arts is something which people should consider not a privilege but a basic right. The public sector should also provide for greater access to housing, better roads and transport systems, decent planning in urban and regional development, and the protection of the environment. It is necessary to put an end, once and for all, to the extraordinary myth that the quality of life and the standards of living of people somehow increase if they have to find money to pay for these things through their own pockets. To provide communally for the basic material and cultural needs of people is not, as the Prime Minister would have us believe, to reduce peoples' freedoms. It is in fact to provide the preconditions for people to exercise genuine freedom and genuine choice. Just as the child who has received a decent education has many more opportunities for self-development than one who cannot read, so the citizen who has been provided with the basic material and cultural needs will be able to flourish and to make a much greater contribution to society. Indeed, the failure of this Government to provide for the basic needs of people, even when they cry out for help, as is the case with the young unemployed and the women in refuges, exemplifies the inhumanity of Fraserism.
       </para>
       <para>
        In pursuing the goal of reducing the public sector, both within the Federal Government and in the States, this Government turns a blind eye to the tragic human consequences. Thus it has tried to make a big business out of the health and welfare of individuals, claiming that we should make people bear the burden. But I ask: Is a person who is so ill as to be hospitalised or a person who turns to a social worker because of the trauma of a broken marriage not sufficiently burdened? Does he or she also need to be further burdened by this Government's stringent financial policies in health and welfare? Is it any wonder that even many Liberals have branded this Government as one totally lacking in compassion? The problems regarding health and welfare can be generalised to all the areas of human needs services I have mentioned. By refusing to expand public services, this Government is not increasing freedom, but keeping people locked in chains of ignorance and poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        But there is a further factor which the Government dogmatically refuses to face up to. In the economy, it is this area of public services which is most labour-intensive and in which growth in employment can take place-if it is allowed to do so. The legacy of the Fraser Government is that, at the time when there is an unprecedented demand for government services, many of the people who can provide those services, such as teachers, are unemployed. Yet the dogmatic claim that the private sector will provide decent jobs for all these people has been exposed as nonsense. At this juncture the Federal Treasurer (Mr Howard) and many members opposite are likely to object: Where is the money coming from? That is a reasonable request and it deserves a considered reply. I do not deny that such a program requires an increased level of public spending-and a substantially increased level at that.
       </para>
       <para>
        What I deny, however, is that this will require increased taxation on workers and their families, for the only way to fund a decent level of public services and to provide a guaranteed minimum income for all is to implement the third aspect of democratic socialism; which is the complete overhaul of the taxation system, including the introduction of a capital gains tax. It has become increasingly clear to the people of this nation that workers and their families are bearing a disproportionate burden with the existing taxation system. This can be easily shown from the estimate of Budget receipts for 1981-82. The biggest contribution to taxation is by far the taxes paid by employees under the pay-as-you-earn system-a total of $17,255m. In addition to this, however, a further $2,913m will be paid in sales tax, including the new tax of 2 1/2 per cent on clothing, books, building materials and many other items. Excise taxes on beer, spirits and cigarettes will be a further $1,859m. Finally, and most importantly, taxes on petrol and related products will be $4,396m. Nearly all of these indirect taxes-amounting to $9,163m-are passed on to consumers, most of whom are workers and their families. On the other hand, companies-I remind the House that many big businesses are foreign owned-are paying only $5,170m. Thus working people are paying more than four times as much in taxes as big business.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government has talked a lot about the possibility of tax reform, but all proposed reforms have been merely to change from direct to indirect taxes. There have not been any reforms which would in fact shift more of the tax burden onto the shoulders of the wealthy and the big corporations. If anything, the Government's abandonment of tax indexation has shifted more of the burden onto families with average or lower incomes. It is therefore necessary to change the distribution of the tax burden in a radical way. The most important reform required here is the introduction of a capital gains tax. Such a tax would prevent the situation whereby many wealthy individuals make handsome profits through the sale of property, shares and assets, but do not have to pay any tax at all. Most Western nations, including the United States, have such capital gains taxes, and the introduction of these to Australia is now an urgent necessity. Such a tax is also very necessary if tax avoidance is indeed to be wiped out, for the ability to represent income as capital gains is by far the major loophole in the tax system, and will be eradicated only when capital gains taxes are introduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Labor Party proposes also to introduce a resources rent tax, and this will also ensure that those resources companies which are making super-profits will pay reasonable taxes on that income. If these measures are introduced, it will be possible to remove the sales taxes imposed by the Government in this Budget and to give some income tax relief to lower and middle order wage earners. These moves would restructure the tax system so that big corporations and wealthy individuals would bear their fair share of the burden. It would also allow a Labor government to present a balanced Budget, if this was considered appropriate fiscal policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, while the above changes to the tax system would allow for moderate extension of public services, the complete program of guaranteed minimum income and major extension of services and public employment outlined earlier requires a further feature: A substantial extension of public ownership in the economy, including especially the introduction of enterprises jointly owned by the public and private sectors. Australia has one of the lowest sectors of public participation in profitable enterprises in the whole Western world. The Government, of course, foolishly believes that it should sell off such profitable enterprises to the private sector, thereby depriving itself of a major non-taxation source of revenue. To do this would be to impose further tax burdens on ordinary Australians, for the lost revenue has to be made up. The Government has not given a single viable reason why such enterprises as the Bendigo Ordnance Factory, the Government bookshops or Trans Australia Airlines should be sold to private enterprise. Strong, profitable public enterprises are essential if we are to provide sufficient public revenue on a long term recurring basis to fulfil the needs of our people. In the Australian context there are two sectors of the economy in which such public enterprises can profitably invest; the resources sector and the high technology sector.

         —I support with pleasure the Budget that has been brought down by this Government. I will refer to a number of specific issues within this Budget that affect this side of the House, the mass of the Australian people and, in particular, those who are resident in my electorate of Calare. Before I do so I congratulate the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) because he is one of the few Opposition speakers who have endeavoured to point out from where the additional revenue would be raised to pay for the principles of democratic socialism that he has been espousing. I do not recall whether the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling), who spoke earlier, endeavoured to say at any stage from where these programs would be funded. If I recollect correctly, at one stage she criticised Government members for being party to increasing expenditure and increasing taxation, yet at the same time that was exactly what she was advocating. I think it has been most interesting and edifying for those people who are listening to this broadcast that they have had confirmed three times in the last 20 minutes that the Australian Labor Party stands for the introduction of a capital gains tax. The coal miners in the Lithgow area earning their $600 to $700 a week, investing in real estate and providing for their retirement, will be very interested to know and to have it confirmed that the Labor Party stands for the introduction of a capital gains tax and that it stands also for the reintroduction of a resources rent tax on super-profits. I ask the honourable member for Burke on the very criteria that the Opposition has proposed for a super-profits tax, how many coal companies would actually be paying a super-profits tax right now? The answer is only one-the Utah company. It will be a long time before significant revenue will be forthcoming from such a tax. The Opposition seems to forget that nasty private enterprise, nasty so-called big business, is very nasty also in that it employs people! The vast proportion of the people of this country are employed by the private sector. I thank the Opposition again for announcing to the people of Australia that it is out to cripple the private sector through a capital gains tax, a super-profits tax and whatever. I would like to know also--

Perhaps they will have an opportunity to speak later during the adjournment debate. A major achievement has been that the deficit has been wiped out. That means that we are now in a position to ask members of the Australian community what options they want. If they want more expenditure then they will have to pay more revenue, more taxes. I imagine that most pay-as-you-earn taxpayers would welcome this Budget when they think about it because they are the people who have been complaining for years, and rightly so, that they are paying an increasingly high proportion of government revenues. For the first time we have spread the tax base across a much broader section of the community than in the past.

         —This dilemma is highlighted in the campaign by the Australian Hotels Association, the publicans, those interested in brewing and associated with the beer industry and, of course, the drinkers. They campaigned against any increase in beer excises and, to a lesser extent, excise on cigarettes and tobacco products. Those excises did not go up in the Budget. It would be interesting for people to realise that during the Whitlam Government period beer taxes went up to be in excess of 4c in every dollar of Government revenue raised. At present, despite the protestations of the honourable member for Burke on behalf of his workers, beer taxes are 2 1/2c in every dollar of revenue raised. Basically, this means that beer drinkers and smokers are paying less of the total tax bill whilst others are having to pay more. They have to realise, as every taxpayer has to realise, where their tax dollars go. The tax dollars are swallowed up by welfare which is largely committed to age pensions, housing, family allowances, unemployment, payments to the States, defence, education, health and interest on government borrowings. That is why as far as the Government is concerned, it is important not to expend more than it is earning.

        I will deal now with some specific measures. Firstly, in the health area the Opposition and some of its colleagues in the States are crying that the health measures that have been introduced will penalise a large mass of the Australian community who will not be able to cover themselves for health insurance costs. This is blatant rubbish. My colleague the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) has pointed out that only one in four Australians will face more expensive health insurance under the new proposals than under the old proposals. Under the new health scheme it is cheaper, or else it is free, for nearly three quarters of the people in Australia. This is largely a result of the expanded coverage for people eligible for free health care, and the introduction of a tax rebate of 32c in the dollar for the basic insurance premium. Opposition members are quiet. It must be because they are in agreement. The New South Wales Government has attempted blatant deception in its advertising of health changes. The Minister for Health in New South Wales, Mr Stewart-I will quote him directly in case some of our more academic friends would like to correct me-stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result of changes to Federal Government legislation affecting health funding . . . free hospital treatment in New South Wales has ended for all, with some exceptions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Stewart then goes on to point out that health care will be available for migrants and refugees in the first six months in Australia as if that is a State initiative. It is not; it is solely Commonwealth. The second point in the New South Wales Ministers' pamphlet is that those on unemployment or special benefits within certain income limits will be eligible for free health care. That is nothing to do with New South Wales; it is entirely Commonwealth. In an advertisement the Minister goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The New South Wales Government will not see sick people denied help because of the Commonwealth's lack of concern for the sick.
       </para>
       <para>
        What the Minister does not say is that 85 per cent of pensioners in New South Wales are already getting free health care under the Commonwealth's programs. Yet Mr Wran and his candidates have the hide to attempt to take credit for that. Over one million pensioners, veterans, low income earners, unemployed and those on special benefits are receiving free health care from this Government. Let us look at the hospital situation. Mr Wran has claimed that through a reduction in health funds for public hospitals he is having to close down public hospitals or change their role and function. Again, what rubbish! The Commonwealth's contribution to public hospitals in New South Wales has increased consistently every year from 1976-77, when it was $315m, until 1980-81, when it was $474m. On top of that the Wran Government should have available to it an additional $51m that it can put into its various health schemes. It acknowledges that fact because it is now saying that it has more funds available so that it can provide free health care for this 15 per cent of pensioners who are not covered by the Commonwealth. Where does that money come from? Mr Wran has also very proudly claimed that he has not had to put up taxes and charges in New South Wales. He has been able to do all these things because of his economic management and economic wizardry. Rubbish! That is largely due to the generosity of the Commonwealth and the tax-sharing formula that this Government introduced which provides for a rebate of personal income tax revenue to the various States.

        In my electorate is a village of Carcoar which has a hospital that has been there for many years. It has been told that it will have to close its doors between the hours of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. but that does not matter, it can still operate as a hospital. That is a hospital that closes at 11 p.m. and opens at 7 a.m. Recently there was a move-it was deferred because of the election-to close its doors from 5 p.m. to 7 a.m., to make it a hospital which operates for 10 hours a day, despite assurances by the New South Wales Minister that the hospital's role and function, particularly its acute care facilities, would not be changed in any way. Honourable members can well imagine how happy the people of Carcoar are when they realise that funds from the Commonwealth have been increasing every year that the Fraser Government has been in power.

        I now turn to some claims made about roads. I was fascinated to see some campaign material from the Australian Labor Party. It was dropped into my letterbox. It claims that in this current Budget the Commonwealth's contribution to roads in New South Wales was $213m and the Wran Government's contribution was $590m. The Commonwealth's contribution is correct; it is $213m. But the Wran Government's claimed contribution of $590m is interesting. When one looks at the New South Wales Budget papers for this current financial year we find that the Wran Government acknowledges that the Commonwealth provided $213m of that $590m. It acknowledges that $288m comes from State revenues and the remainder comes from borrowings and the general loan account. The Commonwealth's contribution is contained within that $590m. Let us look a little further as to where--

         —Of course it is double counting. It is almost triple counting. Let us look at where those road allocations go. The Commonwealth's contribution goes to main roads, local roads and national roads. Of the Wran Government's contribution, virtually nothing goes to national roads and nothing goes to local government roads-the ratepayers and the Commonwealth have to provide for them. Its main contribution goes to main roads. In fact its direct contribution to roads in New South Wales is $200m compared with the Commonwealth's contribution of $214m and a very large proportion of the balance from the New South Wales Government, of $140m, is taken up in debt charges and administration. So much for the claims being made by the New South Wales Government in advertisements about roads. Let us look at the prospect of increasing developmental roads in New South Wales. I personally favour the Commonwealth seriously considering withdrawing from funding rural arterial roads and putting all its efforts into national roads-both national highways and development roads-and the State Government taking full responsibility for its main and trunk roads.

        This morning it was interesting to see that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has ruled that an advertisement by the Public Transport Commission of New South Wales is in breach of the broadcasting legislation as far as electoral advertisements are concerned. That is a very good example of how deceptive the Wran machine is in its election advertising. Yesterday the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), in a very good speech, pointed out the number of senior media officers in the Premier's Department in New South Wales. I do not have the time to go through that list. It is a very horrifying list of people who are directly employed in the Premier's Department by the New South Wales taxpayers. The senior media officers are largely engaged in providing a propaganda machine for the image of the New South Wales Premier. On top of that we know that the New South Wales taxpayers are contributing about $1.25m under the public funding program. That money is being taken from the New South Wales taxpayers by stealth. They are not asked whether or not they wish to provide that money. They were not given the opportunity to have a say in a referendum and they will object very, very, strongly to it. Unfortunately, I do not believe the majority of voters in New South Wales know that they are directly contributing to political parties with which they possibly have no affiliation whatsoever. Worse still, not only do we see the smiling face of Mr Wran projecting his image through advertisements paid for by taxpayers under public funding but also through the Public Transport Commission advertisements and the Carnivale advertisements. The referendum advertising will cost taxpayers in New South Wales the best part of $1m. Again we can see implicit in that advertising an opportunity for the Wran Government to get free electioneering advantage. Let us not forget that the Labor Party in New South Wales and throughout Australia is also supported by union dues and union subscriptions. Again that money is taken from unionists without their say and without their consent. Worse still, it is the only form of political party donation that I know of that is tax deductible.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer now to some matters which relate to local government. The Commonwealth provides a very significant share of its tax revenue to local government. I point out that in some of the areas in my electorate this is a very substantial amount indeed. For example, the greater city of Lithgow this year will receive a 27 per cent increase in funds from the Commonwealth, which amount to $1.129m. It is interesting to note that on a ratepayer basis that amounts to $161 per ratepayer. The State Government's contribution, under the local government assistance fund-untied grants-amounts to $10.50. An amount of $161 per ratepayer has been contributed by the Commonwealth Government and $10.50 per ratepayer has been contributed by the State Government. Yet the New South Wales Government has increased coal royalties by 800 per cent in the last five years. Ratepayers may well ask where those millions of dollars are going.

         —This year's Budget has been described by most commentators as severely contractionary. As the Applied Economic and Social Research Institute at Melbourne University pointed out, it represents new measures to restrain the expansion of demand which are now being introduced just as that expansion is beginning to slow. The Government is using all the instruments of policy open to it-control over interest rates, monetary policy, fiscal policy and Budget policy-to ensure that people's real incomes decline and that their spending power is reduced. This means that the growth in the economy, particularly in the first half of last year, will be allowed to dissipate. The policies must surely result not only in a contraction of the economy and a reduction in the people's incomes but also in a lack of access to public services which form part of the social wage. We should not forget as we look at this Budget that it follows a series of policy announcements which were the result of the deliberations of the Lynch committee, the so-called razor gang. The contraction in the public sector employment must result in a reduction in the quality of government services, which on balance will mean a loss of services to lower income groups.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The changes in health policy announced earlier this year and reflected in the Budget represent a major transfer of cost to the ordinary wage and salary earner. The fact that people will be forcedback into health insurance will mean an extra cost to the average family of at least $10 a week. However, the impact of this change in health insurance arrangements will fall particularly on the lower income family, the so-called working poor. These are the people whose incomes are between $200 and $300 a week, who will be denied access to public hospital without payment and who will be forced to take out health insurance. The changes include also the transfer of responsibility to the States of community health centres and dental care programs, which will mean, in the longer run, that lower income people will lose access to high quality primary health care. This will result in greater long term costs for health services. Thus, the Government continues to tighten the screws, not on its supporters, but on the working people of this nation. It is they who will be paying higher rates of taxation, higher interest rates for housing, more for health care, a higher price for basic consumer goods as a result of sales taxes, import parity prices for petrol to run their cars, higher electricity bills and gas charges and higher fares on public transport.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no compensation on the other side of the ledger. The Government continues to oppose wage and salary increases, to keep a tight rein on non-wage incomes and to reduce access for lower income people to basic services. The massive cutback in public housing programs has been severely criticised by every housing Minister in Australia with the exception of the Commonwealth Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh). The Government is unique among conservative governments. These governments have never been strong on justice. This Government not only reinforces inequality, but is also not prepared to ensure that people are guaranteed basic minimum standards of living. Notwithstanding its political philosophy, this is a government with an antediluvian economic philosophy. John Kenneth Galbraith in his book A life in Our Times noted that in the United States economics are still being taught-one might say that the same is true of Australia-on the basis of a fiction which has no relationship to the economic realities in the twentieth century. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The business firm of the text books is still, in structure and market power, political power and social motivation, the microscopic competitive world of the Marshallian world. Where there were departures it was the exceptional case of monopoly or oligopoly and here both motivation and internal structure were essentially the same. Large or small there was still the driving force of the profit maximizing entrepreneur.
       </para>
       <para>
        He continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        This view of economic and social and political life allowed and still allows hundreds and thousands of students to be instructed in economics each year without intruding or damaging thoughts on the way that, as a matter of inherent and organic character, the great corporation exercises power over prices, costs, technology, consumer taste, military expenditure and government policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Galbraith concluded:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is on the State that the public must rely for the assertion of the public interest. The State however is extensively under the control of corporate power.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once one recognises the transformation of the corporate world into a network of international firms operating on a global basis, one recognises that the nation State's continued existence is at peril as an independent entity. This year's Budget is, in my view, quite clearly transparent to that controlling international interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government is a government in the service of corporate capitalism and of its institution, both private and public. The slogan is no longer: 'What is good for the General is good for America' or for that matter Australia. Rather, we are asked to believe that what is good for CRA Ltd, for Alcoa of Australia Ltd, for ICI Australia Ltd or for Safeway is good for the world. That is what is being challenged-a right of a national government to make an economic policy which it believes to be in the best interests of its citizens. We are being told that such a view is out of date and that the old rules which might have applied in the mercantilist days of the eighteenth century should be applied now. The international market place is the thing, the doctrine of so-called comparative economic advantage, the reduction of trade barriers and the open economy. The government which governs least governs best. An end to regulation by government and the introduction of self-regulation is the prevailing philosophy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The philosophy of supply-side economics which is being foisted on this Parliament and which has the support, not only of the so-called dries but also of opposing camps for the leadership of the Liberal Party, one led by the Prime Minister (Mr Fraser) and the other led by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock)-represents a new phase in the evolution of conservative economic philosophy in this country. It should be seen as post-Menzies in its substance and in its reality. It is producing and will produce deep divisions in the Liberal Party and, I believe, may result, within a matter of a few short years, in the death of that Party. The Liberal Party which has in its history been able to make some claim to represent the interests of local capital is now, in my belief, completely under the domination of international capital. This Budget reflects that change. It reflects the Government's willingness, at the behest of international companies, to sacrifice the interests of the Australian people to demands of international capital. This is reflected in the massive inflow of foreign capital which has taken place in the last financial year. This has amounted to $6,500m. The Government expects and, indeed, hopes that this inflow will continue this year to the tune of $7,000m. The Melbourne Institute has pointed out:
       </para>
       <para>
        Massive private capital inflow was the dominant factor in the money supply growth despite the record current account deficit, and is expected again to be an important source of money supply growth in 1981-82. At the same time to counter this expansionary influence on the money supply, public spending is being cut back and some government authorities are being constrained from borrowing overseas. Yet domestic interest rates are reaching record levels and funds are growing scarce for domestic borrowers, both householders and semi-government authorities while overseas funds for resources development by the private sector remains abundant.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's failure to act to restrain foreign investment in the Australian economy, as opposed to its willingness to slug domestic consumers and services, is to be condemned for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is not at all clear that the funds from the inflow of foreign investment are going where the Government suggests that they may be. There is growing evidence, to which the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) referred, that a substantial proportion of these funds are going into the takeover of existing Australian enterprises and to real estate speculation. Both would be matters of concern. If the emphasis is on foreign takeovers, there is no protection against the loss of control over Australian technology or any protection against asset stripping and rationalisation resulting in reduced employment. The investment in real estate has already attracted government concern, particularly in respect to agricultural land.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, there is also the issue of the investment of foreign capital in real estate ventures in the downtown areas of the larger cities as well as, more generally, in the housing market. The rapid inflation of land and housing prices in Sydney and Melbourne over the past few years has undoubtedly been related to the inflow of foreign capital. It is certainly an important factor in the Sydney property boom.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, it appears that rather than the majority of funds coming in from overseas going into resource development, the resource development is being financed largely from within the Australian capital market. Australian borrowings from foreign controlled corporations as a proportion of total funds raised by these corporations rose from 14 per cent in 1977-78 to 63 per cent in 1978-79. In 1979-80 that proportion was 55 per cent. Foreign controlled corporations have increased their Australian borrowings as a proportion of total domestic savings from 1.4 per cent in 1977-78, to 18.8 per cent in 1978-79 and to 20 per cent in 1979-80; that is, $1 for every $5 saved in Australia is being used by these corporations with no increase in the level of Australian equity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, we have seen that cumulative real growth in the money supply since 1975-76 has been only 4.7 per cent, while the growth in real income has been 14.4 per cent over the same period. This policy of tight money, combined with a massive increase in foreign money coming into the country, has meant that something has had to give. The Government has decided that what should give is the access to money by the domestic householder, the small investor and the semi-government authorities. The result must be a further contraction in the economy, a reduction in services, an increase in unemployment and further depression in living standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fourthly, the Government appears to have disregarded the fact, in its attitude to foreign investment, that not only will we lose effective control of the domestic economy but also we will see increasing amounts of money repatriated in the form of dividends to shareholders in countries overseas. We are in effect building up a debt which must be paid for at some time in the future. Since 1972-73 the net outflow of funds associated with direct investment by overseas firms has exceeded the actual inflow of funds from abroad. In fact, over the period from 1972-73 to 1978-79 the excess of net outflow of funds amounted to $1,933m. In 1977-78, $1 in every $3 of company income in Australia was being repatriated overseas. As the levels of foreign investment go up so must the levels of foreign repatriation. In addition, repatriation of debt will increase. Each year between 1973-74 and 1979-80 the net effect of foreign investment on balance of payments was negative. Once the current phase of capital investment ends the balance of payments deficits will go up on the invisibles account. So it is that the Government is in the process of selling this nation. This nation is literally for sale. We have never had a government which was less committed to overall development, to balanced development, to facing the problems of people as opposed to dealing in fictions and in abstractions.
       </para>
       <para>
        In no area of policy is the unreality of government policy more apparent than in the resources area. For years the Government has been holding before us the mirage of resource development as the saviour of the country's economy. Each year, and especially in election years, the figures get to be grander and grander. However, in all the time the Government has been in office there has never been a serious economic analysis of any of the projects, and certainly not of the projects that affect particular industries. The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson), who is at the table, is responsible for environmental matters. For years people have said: 'Let us look at the aluminium industry in this country. Let us look at all the costs as well as the benefits. Let us see what an industry of a certain scale would do for the people of this country'. Never at any stage has the Government conceded that that kind of analysis is necessary. Never has the Government committed itself to analysing what are the costs and benefits that may be associated with the development of, for example, a resource-based industry. It has simply asserted that we stand to gain from these developments. However, in the meantime we need to cut consumption, tighten spending, reduce real wages, run down public services, reduce people's standards of living and sharpen inequality.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are associated with the resource development area a number of basic questions which any responsible national parliament would want to ask itself and would want to see answered. There are, for example, questions about the model of the economy which will see the nations real income built more and more in terms of export earnings. At least that is the assumption. What are the lessons of CRA's result this year? The fact is that that company and a fair share of the Australian economy, one could say, were totally dependent on what was happening in terms of international metal exchanges. Those exchanges went down internationally, that company's income went down to zero, and the Government's income necessarily would have gone down with it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us take the aluminium industry. If the market remains depressed for two or three years, as internationally it is depressed at the moment, what happens to all the increased power capacity that is being provided by State governments across this country, at the price of rapidly escalating electricity bills-an increase of 40 per cent in the last 12 months in Victoria-if the aluminium industry does not go ahead to the projected levels of development? We are heading for a disaster. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) said yesterday at an Estimates committee hearing that it was of no concern to the Federal Government what the economics were of any resource project even though this Government authorised special infrastructure loans to encourage the States to race with a mad rush into power development to service an industry which historically has been highly cyclical and which is quite likely not to be able to sustain the kind of industry that the corporate sector plans for Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        What would be the implications for the public sector of this mad rush into power stations, coal loaders and capital infrastructure which is taking place across the country? Who is paying for it? The answer is that it is being paid for by the present consumers. That is why those prices are going up in Victoria and in various other States. The people are paying higher electricity prices so that companies can go in for these gigantean schemes which are based on an economic analysis in which this Government expresses no interest and which in my view is quite possibly faulty. What, one might ask, does the restructuring of the Australian economy mean in terms of the domestic economy, in terms of the way in which the society is operating? Do we as a society really wish to divide the country between the Sunbelt, as it is called in the United States of America, and the established cities? What are the social implications of so-called unbalanced development? I have been in Chicago, New York and in the north-east of the United States. That part of the country is a disaster area, whatever may be happening in the Sunbelt. I think we need to look very seriously at what restructuring means in terms of its social implications. We as a country cannot develop as we have in the past by importing a massive labour force from overseas to work in manufacturing industries and then say in 1980: 'That is it. That is the end of manufacturing industry. We do not want that any more. We are going into all these resource projects which are highly capital intensive, which will employ very few people and certainly will not employ the people who are currently unemployed'.
       </para>
       <para>
        What are the implications of moving to a kind of development which will have us exporting more energy, processing minerals and importing more finished goods, especially capital goods? What will be the future of manufacturing industry under these policies? Can we assume that net economic and social benefits, in terms of the industries in which the Government has decided to allow free market forces to operate-that is, the international oligopolies-will expand without regulation? Where are the overall cost benefit analyses which prove that when all the costs and the benefits are calculated there will be a net gain? What are we prepared to sacrifice to let this whole process happen?
       </para>
       <para>
        The short term costs of unplanned and market oriented resource development are getting to be clearer and clearer. Most people understand them. They mean higher interest rates, reduced government services, and mounting housing prices in resource areas and in the established areas of the large cities. They mean the diversion of capital away from established areas in favour of new areas that may never be established as any more than temporary cities. We have seen all this before in this country and we know what it means. This country was built on a tradition of people living their lives in temporary cities that finally decline and die when the gold is gone. We are building on unstable and uncertain foundations.

        The new gold-uranium-is being exploited for uncertain markets in a world in which it would be the fuel to destroy civilisation. There may be a few bucks in it; it is by no means certain. It is more certain that it represents a threat to the life of the Aboriginal people at Oenpelli. It is certain that it will threaten the lives of those people who work in the industry. It is clear that there will be fewer, rather than more, safeguards internationally. Uranium will be a fuel for destruction exploited by international companies which have infinite confidence in their own survival and very little interest in the survival of people.

        This Budget is the Budget of a people whose masters have no interest in or loyalty to this society. It is unfortunate that the suburban lawyer who is our Treasurer and who is undoubtedly a good bookkeeper does not have a greater sensitivity to the larger issues that are involved in the way in which this society is being restructured. I conclude by referring to an article by Kenneth Davidson in the Age of 3 September, in which he said:

         —Every Budget presented by this Government since its return has been met by the Opposition with words of gloom and despair. As usual, what we have heard today and what we have been listening to with unremitting lack of zeal in recent days is no exception. The inability of the Australian Labor Party even to formulate a viable alternative Budget and the performance of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) on the floor of this House make it quite clear that the Labor Party of Australia is still not able to lead this country and has learned nothing in its years in isolation on the Opposition benches. Deficit budgeting, as advocated by the Opposition, cannot bring about lower inflation. It cannot reduce interest rates. It can achieve nothing of lasting worth. In fact, it would destroy the sound economic measures which have achieved excellent results over the last six years. It has taken us all that time to restore the confidence of Australians in Australia and of the world in Australia. Yet those people opposite forget so easily that under Labor, under the Whitlam Administration, in one year alone personal income tax rose by 46 per cent, compared with wage rises of a mere 23 per cent.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We have been told by the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous), who is an outstanding spokesman for left wing democratic socialism, that we have to have more taxes, we have to have resource rental taxes, and we have to have capital gains taxes; that it is a sin for people to make any money; that the only honest man is one who is employed by the state for the state. What about the fact that the state is supposed to be the servant of the people? We have heard nothing of that, not a word. Once again, day after day we hear this extraordinary diatribe that somehow or other the economic system, based on the sweat and the capacity of the Australian people is to be given second or third place, in the belief that the solutions to Australia's problems are to be found simply in more and not less government interference, in more and not less taxation, in more and more detailed involvement of a government based in Canberra in the day to day activities of the Australian people.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government rejects that. This Government has been returned on three occasions on the firm understanding that we intend to develop Australia, to develop its resources, to give the people of this great nation of ours every opportunity we possibly can to achieve what this nation is capable of. That can be achieved only if we have policies directed at lowering and controlling inflation, policies directed at giving as many people as we possibly can useful and sustaining employment, policies directed at supplying the fundamental requirements of those in our community who, for whatever reason, do not have the opportunities to claim a fair share of this country's resources. Of course it is the responsibility of the state to see that those people's way of life and standard of living is maintained at a reasonable level. That cannot be achieved by the simple process of taxing people out of existence, nor can it be achieved by the continuation of policies which, in the eyes of the Labor Party, direct themselves at nothing more than taking from some and not giving to those who are in need. The taxes they take will simply be used up in more and more public administration employing more people to interfere in the decisions that other people have to make for themselves. This country would return once again to the doldrums we suffered so deeply in the years from 1972 to 1975.

         —A socialist republic. This nation wants to see dynamic development, development is not just a case of how many tonnes of iron ore we drag out of the ground. Development is more than that. It is the capacity to give to our people a belief in their role in the development of this nation. The policy we are enunciating and the principles we have once again emphasised in this Budget are the only ways we will be able to achieve those objectives.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Let us look at the record. In the last 12 months we have seen a reduction of inflation of 2 per cent. We are now down to about 8.8 per cent, which is the lowest we have had for some time. On international standards, comparing Australia's record with that of members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development group, which is a fair comparison, we are seen internationally as an outstanding example of a young and dynamic community led by a government which knows where it is going in terms of philosophical principles, a government which knows how it will reduce inflation, which knows the difficulties that have to be faced and the often difficult decisions that have to be made. Success can be achieved only by a continuity of policy, not by changing our shirts every time it seems convenient, not by Opposition going to every group in the community and saying: 'We will give you more because we, the Opposition don't have to pay for it'. The simple fact which the Labor Party has consistently refused to accept is that the Government has the role of collecting taxation. It has, as a Government, to answer to the Australian people for what it has done. The Australian people in 1981 have not forgotten the lessons they learned with such difficulty in the past.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Budget symbolises yet again the Government's determination to protect and to build upon the economic gains that we have already achieved. Decisive reductions in the deficit to further reduce inflation and to help ease pressure on interest rates are essential. We have heard so much today, and on other occasions, of the difficulties of young people in getting homes. I sympathise with them. All members of the Government parties sympathise. Most of us owe money to somebody, usually to the banks. We know what interest rates mean. We also know that there is no simple solution to high interest rates, certainly none suggested by the Opposition, except to cut back the Government's demand on the money market for funds, to ensure that the funds which are available in the Australian economy are able to be purchased at market values on the basis of priorities which will be set by the market-place. On many occasions in the past governments have tried to interfere with this basic economic fact. On every occasion all they have done is make the situation worse.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said this morning, there are already indications that high interest rates have reached their maximum. I sincerely hope he is correct. I have noted with some optimism the trend in the United States in the last week. There are indications that if the United States interest rate structure settles down, and possibly falls, we will see a similar situation developing in Australia. I emphasise the point that there is no easy short-term solution to this type of problem. The fact of the matter is that there is more demand for money in Australia at present than available funds can be found in the market-place. Inevitably, the result of that is that prices for money, as for any other commodity, must rise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite this situation, the benefits of the Government's fight against inflation have been clearly seen. Investment growth in the last 12 months increased by 20 per cent. A total of 140,000 new jobs have been created in 1980-81 alone. Through our training programs we hope to see a similar trend this year as well. Living standards are rising. Last year there was a 4 per cent increase in real terms. Only last week we learned that average weekly earnings were nearly $300 a week, the highest they have ever been in Australia's history. Confidence in Australia's economic future is obviously well on the way to being restored. The creation of additional jobs and higher real incomes is dependent on sustaining this confidence to generate further investment and productive growth for the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of subjects have been raised this afternoon to which I would like to refer. Firstly, we have the question of income tax. I made the observation earlier that it was under Labor that Australia reached its highest record annual level of income tax. Let nobody in this chamber or outside forget that fact. In 1977 the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), who is at the table-he was then the honourable member for Denison-and I started a campaign called 'The 50c League'. On that occasion we took for the people of Australia to the Government, the demand that the maximum rate of tax should be 50c in the dollar. It is known that for economic reasons we did not achieve 50c in the dolar on that occasion, but we did achieve a significant cut-back in the mariginal tax rate in the last Lynch Budget which followed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe on the basis of the taxation policies that have been followed by the Government this year, in particular the introduction of indirect taxation, the principles of which I support, that the Government will be in a position at the time of the next Budget to bring down considerable taxation reforms and reductions. It is in that context that I believe the Government should direct its efforts at maximising the rate of taxation at no more than 50c in the dollar. A similar reduction in all rate scales must, therefore, be carried through to ensure that pensioners and people on low incomes do not find themselves on higher tax scales purely because of inflationary factors. After all, the tax scales have not been changed since 1976. I hope that the next Budget will see reforms in that area.
       </para>
       <para>
        This country will develop on the basis of people having more spending power on which they can make their own decisions. That they should have to give more money to governments indefinitely-this is the policy of the alternative government, the Labor Party-is obviously not the solution to Australia's problems in the future. The Leader of the Opposition was the man who presided as Treasurer over the introduction of the five most arduous taxation scales in the period 1974-75. He also presided as a member of the Government over the highest rate of taxation we have ever seen in Australia. The introduction of indirect taxation has generated a substantial amount of noise and little else from members of the Opposition. It is interesting that they should take this view. I would have thought that in any logical examination of the situation most Australian people would ask for a reduction of direct income tax in return for some increase in indirect taxes. I believe that the first step has been taken. I am optimistic that in the next Budget we will see a reduction in direct taxation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now refer to employment. In the last two years the number of people in jobs has increased by 330,000, the biggest increase in Australia's history. Spending on employment and training programs in this Budget alone has increased by 22 per cent in 1980-81. We expect to train 200,000 young people during this financial year, with 90,000 benefiting from participation in the Special Youth Employment Training Program alone. It is interesting to note some of the observations which have been made by members of the Opposition on this subject in this chamber in recent days and, in particular, in earlier years. I refer to the Community Youth Support Scheme which the Government for good reason has decided to scrap. The honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) this afternoon described this program as 'the best $14m the Government has ever spent'. Yet, one of her senior colleagues, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) at the time we introduced the CYSS program said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . is no more than tokenism, confined to creating drop-in centres, providing cuddle therapy rather than the jobs young people really need . . . The $12.6m would be better spent on genuine job creation and training programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is exactly what we are now doing. The funds which are being taken from CYSS are being spent on a range of job training programs. It is strange how the memories of Opposition members are so short. They can afford such a luxury, hoping that nobody ever reads back into Hansard. However, with the abolition of the CYSS program I believe that we may face some difficulties. I do not accept the view that it is the responsibility of government to be the sole source of employment training. I believe the community has been and is willing to accept a real share of responsibility in this area. Therefore, I was delighted to note the remarks made by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) recently that if required the Government would be prepared to consider new programs to look after the section of unemployed youth who, for various reasons, often over which they have little if any control, are not able to fit in to the of training programs which will receive increased funding from the Government. It is my personal view that in the next 12 months or so such a new program may well be required.
       </para>
       <para>
        On this subject I speak with some passion and concern. For three years in Sydney in my electorate I have been demonstrating through a pilot program called 'Youth Work' that there is a very close relationship between unemployment and the problems that a section-it is probably as high as 25 per cent-of unemployed youth face in being able to return to or be integrated into normal job employment opportunities. Many of these young people have difficulties in reading and writing. For those people to go into a program of training which involves academic disciplines is therefore, to put it mildly, somewhat difficult. There is a range of reasons why they are in that position, not the least of which are breakdowns in families and inability to receive an education in the normal context.
       </para>
       <para>
        In those cases the Government has the opportunity to work with the community-I emphasise that-in encouraging the development of programs which gives the opportunities which every communtiy has for work training and experience and develop in young people perceptions of their capacity to make a contribution to society. Through self help work participation programs we can break down the deep-seated belief of many young people that they do not belong to society. They have a feeling of lack of participation and sense of self esteem, a belief that they are not a part of the community as a whole. We cannot encourage these people to develop such attitudes. We cannot as a government or a community allow them to persist any longer. We therefore have to find ways to develop community employment opportunities, to work with them to meet the community's needs. Participants must earn money and feel that they have a role to play. The 'Youth Work' program developed in Sydney has achieved much along these lines. I do not for a second suggest that it is necessarily perfect for everybody but it has certainly worked well in our area. The success rate is within the range of 65 per cent to 70 per cent. I believe that this is a result with which we can be justly satisfied. The role of government must be to help to create the conditions, climate and opportunities for people if it wants them to have a more direct role in the activities of this nation as a whole.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to foreign investment. It has been for many years the big bogy of the Labor Party. It believes that this nation somehow can develop and create the funds to keep our economy moving forward and not slipping backwards, as it did under Whitlam; that we do not need any foreign money to do it. The simple fact is that this nation has always been an importer of foreign capital. If we consider the various boom periods of the 19th and 20th centuries and what has been achieved it is abundantly clear that we are the ones who have come out on the right side of the ledger. However, the time has now come for us to give serious consideration to the further development of Liberal philosophy. It has always been the view of most, if not all, Australians that the individual has the right to sell his labour on the market. Strangely enough, however, we have never really developed the concept that the same individual has the right to sell his capital at the going market rate. That is the essence of the concept of Trust Australia which some honourable members may be aware I and my colleague Mr Moore are developing. It has been referred to in the media. I hope to see the Government take initiatives in this area in the near future.
       </para>
       <para>
        The basic principle of Trust Australia is that every Australian has the right to feel that he can participate in a practical way in the development of this nation and gain from his investments. Because he is prepared to share the risks as well as the benefits of developing Australia he may increase his income by dividends. It is not good enough for the Labor Party to prattle on about the flow of capital out of Australia in the form of dividends. That does not always have to be the situation. A great amount of that capital can remain in Australia provided the Australian people are prepared to take the risks. I regret to say that over the years there has not been a strong tendancy to do so. Equally, one has to be fair and say that the capital market is structured in such a way that the average Australian does not have access to those opportunities. Only 4 per cent of people in the Australian community, according to statistics prepared by the associated stock exchanges, actually own equity in Australian companies. For a country which has to develop so far and so fast, I regard that as a grossly unsatisfactory figure. What about the other 96 per cent? What can be done for them?
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the proposals within the context of Trust Australia is that we should develop either one or a group of national trusts which will enable people who do not have access to the markets, people who do not understand the fine details of the monetary system, to be able to make investments in Australian companies on the basis of advice given to the trust by professional experts in the business to ensure that people have the opportunity to participate. On the basis of that experience, if they then want to go the next step and make individual investments, let them have the right to do so. The same principle applies to old people-the pensioners. Leaving money in a sock under the bed or putting it in no interest bearing deposits in banks is a travesty of the opportunities which should be given in the capitalist system. Those people, regardless of their age, have the right to be able to sell their capital at the going market rate. In that context, therefore, they also have a role to play in Trust Australia. On the basis of French experience, it is proposed that we should give investors a tax deduction on the maximum rate dividend or income of up to $1,500 a year. This would encourage average Australians to put their capital to work for the benefit of Australia and for their families.

         —We are debating Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1981-82 which proposes to appropriate sums out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for new policies, capital works and services, payments to the States and for the ordinary annual services of government. The Budget Papers accompanying the Appropriation Bills reflect the government's decisions and priorities on expenditure in relation to income received. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) because one would reasonably expect that the annual priorities of any government would seek to provide sufficient funds to all sectors of the Australian community so that all Australians would be in a position to receive a fair share of the wealth of our nation. In the time available to me this afternoon I intend to portray how the Government's Budget for 1981-82 is not one which provides a fair share of the wealth of our nation to those in need but rather provides further concessions to those people in our community least in need and places greater burdens on those requiring assistance. In this, the Government's eighth Budget in six years, we see the worst example of the gross discrepancies in the division of the national cake between competing interests. It is a Budget that ignores the needs of the average family and of the disadvantaged. It is a Budget of deceit because tax concessions promised in October last year have been cancelled and the promises made earlier this year by the Government not to increase indirect taxes have been broken.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I will deal firstly with revenue proposed to be raised under the Budget. The people of Australia need to be reminded that this Government came into office last October after promising tax reforms and tax cuts yet it is now responsible for the highest taxes in our history. Over the last five years this Government has taken $124,000m in taxes from the people of Australia. During the current financial year the Government proposes to tax the people a further $37,768m-an increase of 16 per cent over last year. When taking into consideration the fact that wages are expected to rise by 13.5 per cent and prices by 10.75 per cent, the increase in taxation revenue is quite considerable. It is even more considerable to those earning a wage because of the additional burden of taxation which they will endure under the pay-as-you-earn system whereby tax is deducted directly from wages prior to payment of those wages. On the Government's own admission personal income tax has gone up by 22 per cent. Over the past six years, pay-as-you-earn taxpayers have had to pay an additional 15 per cent in taxation for every dollar earned. During the current financial year, pay-as-you-earn income tax payments are expected to rise by no less than 22 per cent whereas income tax payers not in the pay-as-you-earn system are expected to pay only 5.3 per cent more in income tax than in the previous year, which obviously represents a very marked fall in the share of their incomes being paid as tax. What this means, in cold hard facts, is that when this Government came to office six years ago, the working person on a normal wage paid $1 in tax for every $5 earned. Today, it is $1 in tax for every $4 earned. In those six years, wages have doubled but pay-as-you-earn tax has risen by 150 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the other side of the coin. Six years ago, companies paid 48 per cent of their profits in tax. The level this year is expected to be 41 per cent. In other words, companies which six years ago had to pay $1 in tax for every $2.10 in profits now have to pay only $1 in tax for every $2.40 in profits. Six years ago on average 17c in non-PAYE income tax was paid for every $1 of non-wage income. Today, the level is only 14c. The sense of inequity felt by pay-as-you-earn taxpayers when they see that other income earners are paying a continually falling share of total revenue from income tax is especially likely to elicit understandable discontent with the existing levels of money wages and salaries. Pay-as-you-earn wage and salary tax payers also may note with interest the allowance of $220m for revenue shortfalls in taxation on non-PAYE individuals resulting from tax avoidance practices. This means that the rise in revenue from non-PAYE taxpayers would be more than twice as great but for these tax avoidance practices.

        On top of those taxation increases I have just outlined, the Government also is increasing sales tax on a broad range of items, some of which in the past attracted no sales tax impost at all. Receipts from sales tax this financial year will increase by $811m to $2,913m or, in percentage terms, by a massive 38.6 per cent. The decision to impose sales tax on a number of goods previously excluded means that clothing, footwear, drapery, soft furnishings, manchester, et cetera, building materials, books, magazines, newspapers, packaging and wrapping materials, tools and a range of other goods, not including at this stage food, medicine or wine, will now be taxed. What these increases mean, of course, is that a family of four now will pay an additional $4 per week for their basic necessities of life. The cost of a home also will increase by approximately $1,000 because of the impost of sales tax on building materials. For those families with children at school, the increases will be even higher because of the clothing content involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the debate on the Sales Tax Amendment Bills a few weeks ago, I stated that I believe that the present sales tax increases are only the beginning and that food items and services which are presently exempt will be the next series of goods to be brought under the scope of sales tax imposts. This would then complete the package of suggestions made by Treasury in its 1974 Taxation Paper No. 5 dealing with Commonwealth taxation of goods and services. I predict that by next year the Government will have imposed sales tax on food and services which, if taxed at 2 1/2 per cent, will bring in additional revenue of at least $600m at today's prices. What this means in hard terms is that families will be paying a further $2.50 a week for their necessities. I seek the permission of the House to incorporate in Hansard Appendices D and E of that Treasury Paper No. 5 of 1974 which bear out what I have just outlined to the House.

        This table is presented in such a way as to show the expected yield from goods that might fairly readily be brought within the coverage of the tax, more essential goods that would be more difficult to bring back within the coverage of the tax, and finally those items of expenditure which fall at least in part outside the definition of consumption expenditure and which would involve to some extent the taxation of producer goods. It can be seen that the first category of goods, the taxation of which might encounter less opposition than the second category, would provide only limited additional revenue.

       </para>
       <para>
        The table shows estimates on the basis of four different assumed rates of tax. If services were included within the scope of a retail sales or value added tax it would be desirable in the interests of administrative simplicity for the rate on services to be the same as that on goods. A separate tax on services in conjunction with the existing wholesale sales tax would not necessarily result in administrative advantages if imposed at the same rate as the tax on goods. It is not necessary, therefore, to think in terms of rates equivalent to the wholesale sales tax. It can be seen, however, that quite high rates of tax would be necessary if substantial amounts of revenue were to be raised by taxing services.

The costs of food and other essential goods have continued to rise and the cost of homes is beyond the reach of most wage earners. These massive increases in revenue are designed virtually to eliminate the Government's deficit during the current financial year for the express purpose of creating a reserve situation so that in 1983-an election year-the Government will be in a position again to bribe the people of Australia with promises of lower taxes. On three previous occasions the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) bribed the people of Australia at election time with promises of lower taxes. Eact time, after the elections had been won, the Prime Minister promptly not only broke his promises but also actually increased taxes. Obviously, we can expect the same lies and deceit in 1983.

It is not a low tax government; in fact it is the highest taxing government ever seen in this country. This is a government whose aim is to shift the burden of revenue from the wealthy in our society on to the shoulders of those in the middle and lower income brackets. It proposes to do this by increasing indirect taxes and lowering direct taxes. This was confirmed by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on the Caroline Jones radio program on Tuesday morning of this week when he said that the Government was aiming at a different mix of taxes, so that indirect taxes are further increased. Promises made earlier this year by the Government that it did not propose to increase direct taxes were nothing but a pack of lies.

        I now refer to the way in which the Government proposes to spend the funds available to it during the current financial year. If we turn to table 1 of Budget Paper No. 10 we see that the Government proposes to expend $40,862m through Commonwealth Government departments embraced within the Budget. In table 5 we see that a further $2,655m will be spent through Commonwealth authorities such as Telecom Australia and Australia Post, et cetera, which is not provided for in the Budget Bill before the House at present. This gives a total expenditure by the Government during the current financial year of $43.5 billion. During its six years of office government expenditure has increased from $20.6 billion to $43.5 billion, an increase of 111 per cent. The big difference, however, lies not in the amount of money expended, but in the priorities into which funds were channelled. Six years ago, under a Labor government, the major priorities were health, education, housing, welfare and urban and regional development. All those priorities have been reversed by the present Government to the extent where we see that funds for those priority areas have fallen. In real terms, education expenditure has fallen by 2 per cent, health is down by 22 per cent, transport and communications are down by 53 per cent, housing is down by 59 per cent and urban and regional development and environment are down by a massive 89 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government also will not provide the $9m necessary to continue funding the Community Youth Support Scheme, a scheme which directly employs almost 700 staff and which last year aided some 55,000 young unemployed people throughout Australia. The CYSS program conducted in my electorate at Panania has been very successful in providing 52 jobs and hope for some 1,700 young unemployed people over the last six months. Not only has it been able to find jobs for young people but more importantly it has given them a self-respect which will stand them in good stead and give them an advantage when they seek employment in our ever diminishing job market. The scheme deals with young people with a myriad of problems, including those from broken homes and those with drug related problems. Young people coming to the CYSS offices for help require special attention which, in my opinion, cannot be provided at normal Commonwealth Employment Service offices. I appeal to the Government to be big enough to reverse its decision to close down CYSS. Nine million dollars is a very modest sum indeed to provide to a scheme which is giving such human assistance to those young people in need. I place on record my appreciation of those people on the Panania CYSS management committee and of its two project officers for their tireless efforts and dedication in providing counselling and assistance to so many local unemployed young people over recent years. I can only hope and pray that their work can continue.
       </para>
       <para>
        Government decisions in the welfare area are also dismal, with no new projects being funded and some organisations being funded at the same level as has applied for the last two years. I instance two local welfare organisations in my electorate which are struggling to survive. The Association for Children with Learning Disabilities at Peakhurst this year will receive $38,500, the same amount as it received last year. In 1979-80, however, it received $54,000. How in heaven's name does the Government expect this Association to keep going when its funds in real terms have been halved in two years? The Bankstown-East Hills Handicapped Children's Centre at Revesby has received a grant of $14,000, the same amount as for the last two years. It sought funds of over $30,000 to enable it to provide sufficient services. These organisations are surviving only because of the dedication of parents and of management. They run raffles, and social nights and fetes to raise funds so that young people attending these centres will continue to receive assistance. What kind of a government do we have that denies our handicapped children the right to a decent life? I will tell honourable members. This is a miserly and miserable government which decrees that funds go to the strong, the greedy, the rich and not to those in need. It is a government which has shown a great degree of indifference to the needs of the vast majority of Australians.

        This Budget means more inflation, even higher interest rates and less economic growth. It is a savage attack on the living standards of Australian families. Australia now has the dubious distinction of having the second highest interest rates in real terms in the world. There is little light at the end of the tunnel, too, because whilst the Government continues to encourage an even larger inflow of foreign money than the $6.5 billion reached last year, interest rates will stay at a high level. Of this money coming in from overseas, $3 out of every $4 is going into taking over existing Australian businesses.
       </para>
       <para>
        Families with three or more children total 26 per cent of all families in Australia. They will benefit from the increased family allowances-the first increase in five years. However, the other 1.5m families, many of them young families starting out, will get nothing. Instead they will have to pay out on a whole range of higher indirect taxes, including a new tax on essential goods such as clothing, as I previously have mentioned. These higher taxes come on top of increased health insurance payments and higher home loan repayments which already have been announced. It is another government Budget that takes more than it gives. Increased welfare benefits for a minority of families, pensioners and the unemployed will cost the Government less than $100m; yet the new taxes will cost the Australian community more than $450m. On top of all this the Government is planning a massive 22 per cent increase in income tax revenue, which means that the average taxpayer will have to pay an extra $580 this year, or more than $11 a week.
       </para>
       <para>
        Overall, the Budget does nothing for Australia's future, despite all the sacrifice of the last five years. There will be more inflation, higher interest rates, less economic growth, no joy for the unemployed and higher taxes. In summary, three of every four Australian families get nothing from this Budget except higher taxes. In total, the Government's economic policy has cost the average family paying off a home an additional $40 a week because of the following increases: Income tax, $11 per week; sales tax, $4 per week; health insurance, $8 per week; and home repayments, because of interest rate increases, $17 per week. The Government has completely and utterly lost its credibility with the Australian electorate because of its success rate in breaking election promises and its dismal record in halting inflation and interest rates. It is a government which is not fit to govern. If it had any self-esteem it would resign and face the electorate so that it could be judged on its abysmal record.

        In conclusion, I refer to a matter raised by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) last Wednesday evening in this debate. He cast reflections on myself and other members of the Opposition by insinuating that the oaths of allegiance taken last November were not taken properly because of the Labor Party's recent policy of working towards the goal of achieving a republic status for Australia. This Minister, who struts around Parliament, often displaying a greater degree of dress sense than good sense, should realise that loyalty to the Crown is not diminished by a longing for the reform of Australia into a more democratic society. I reinterate what I said in my maiden speech to this House on 26 November 1980: I consider that after almost 200 years of settlement Australia has advanced enough to be able to stand on its own feet and manage its own affairs without being dependent on outside influences. I believe that Australia should become a republic whilst remaining a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, and I will pursue that goal while I am a member of this Parliament, which I predict will be for a longer period than the honourable member for Denison will be able to achieve.

         —This is not an ideal week, I believe, in which to speak on anything in this House because this place certainly has been groaning and creaking under the influence of the New South Wales State elections. I guess it has been accepted by most members as one of the facts of political life that an important State election such as that in New South Wales must intrude into the expression of party political views in this House. In some ways it has been a matter of some amusement, as well as concern about the issues which have been raised during the State election campaign.

        However, when those matters continue to be raised on the Thursday after all other electronic media have been silenced with regard to election matters, I believe this House should view with greater seriousness the way in which it regards that ban which applies to other people but not to this place. One of several things obviously can result. If the House is sitting on the Thursday, we can debate matters of State electoral importance. If we do that we will encourage the public outside who may be concerned in the media either to disregard the law or to regard us as less than adequate in making that law. I suggest that Parliament can do one of two things in that regard. Either it can decide not to sit on the Thursday and, therefore, not put the House to some form of public ridicule by itself not having regard to a law it requests all citizens to have regard to, or it can alter that law. In response to the spectacle we saw today, I suggest it is time for the Government to amend the Act to make it lawful in some fashion for the electronic media outside this place to enjoy the same freedoms that we enjoy here.

        I have pleasure in supporting the general aspects of the Budget this year. I congratulate the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on the continuing thought that he has given to the Australian economy and on his bravery in facing some of the very hard questions within his portfolio. I will make some direct mention of some of the minor things which irritate me. Of course, one would expect any Budget of any party to have some minor irritations because of the very disciplines I have referred to. In the first place, it is encouraging to see that the Government is dealing responsibly with interest rates and the economy in general by having a Budget surplus.
       </para>
       <para>
        In that regard one need only listen to members of the Opposition today and throughout this general debate to see the total inadequacy of the Australian Labor Party in fronting the proposition that it might be an alternative government. It has learned little, if anything, from the years of the Whitlam Administration. One hoped for the sake of Australia that it might have learned something. One hoped, perhaps for the success of Liberal policies, that it had not. Quite frankly, it has not. Very few honourable members opposite have given any indication of what the source of the increased spending they advocate would be, except the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) who today was brave and honest enough to detail where the money should come from to formulate his democratic socialist program. When one considers the few people who advocate a different and additional source of money for their socialist programs, one finds that they will again destroy the engine of the economy. By the proposals they put up they can only so deter enterprise in this community that we will get back to the Whitlam years of a slack economy, a slack exploration program around the country and a total lack of enterprise in any risk-taking in the community. After all, risk-taking stands behind much of the development we have and only it can provide the jobs which so many opposite prate about.
       </para>
       <para>
        The imposition of sales tax in the Budget, as the Treasurer has stated, is obviously a major new initiative to broaden the tax base so that at some time in the near future we may be able to get at the income tax disincentives now arising in the community. As the average weekly wage will soon take so many Australians for the first time into the second and higher rate of taxation, we can see how urgent it is that the Government give some attention to this matter. Difficult as it is always to broaden taxation in such a way that it affects every member of the community, nevertheless, it is necessary to effect the reforms that lie in the future for us. The generally consistent approach of the Government to inflation, the determination to present to the Australian community the challenges and alternatives which face it, are again the Budget's essential and laudable attributes.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose the general question in the community with respect to this Budget is how we manage success, because Australia is going through a period of sustained growth. We are not debating the difficulties of depression. We, as a community, are assessing whether we can manage the various conflicting interests who all want to share in that growth. It is interesting again to find that members of the Opposition deal with this problem, as they so often do, from a position of envy and greed and decide that incentives must give way to the proposition that we can give but do not have to produce. This seems to be inherent in their answer to the general proposition of how we deal with the conflicting interest in the community. There is a very real conflict between those who receive and those who provide the revenue for the various welfare and assistance programs with which the Government is involved. This is drawn to the attention of the House in the Budget Papers when pensions and allowances are referred to. I quote this paragraph:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has decided to amend the pension income test provisions to address some of the deficiencies in the law that enable people to deprive themselves of income in order to obtain a pension . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        We know that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) is facing immense pressures in keeping his budget to something which the economy can generally meet. I applaud his intentions to see that it is administered fairly and without favour. One must recognise, however, that these people who depend on pensions for security in the evening of their lives are not to be treated lightly in the sense that they can be compared with some others in the community who deliberately avoid their contributions by way of income tax or some other tax collection. They are people who often do not understand the workings of the financial structure and take action to protect themselves, often to their own detriment. Nevertheless, they take that action to avoid what they see as an imposition on them by government stricture. Whether or not we like it, there is a rising tide of expectation amongst aged people in this community that we have to contend with if we are to bring any discipline, as has been referred to by the Treasurer, into the administration of the pension schemes. I certainly urge caution.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make this little specific reference: We must have regard to the fact that no scheme or variety of schemes can completely solve the problem of the fairly widespread deposits held by pensioners in various banks or societies in such a way that they will not bear income and, therefore, depreciate their ability to collect a pension or to hold a health benefit card. For instance, those aged people who know the financial world can deposit their money simply in the value of their home, which is something no government can claim to be income. If a would-be pensioner or a would-be pensioner couple had tens of thousands of dollars spare, they could easily in a sense get rid of it in a non-income producing area by buying a more expensive home. I hope that when the Minister is dealing with this he will be tolerant and recognise that these are people who stand by themselves and are not to be seen, as others often are, as tax avoiders or as people who are anti-social in their attitude to the general community.

        Of course, the impact of high interest rates, which the Budget attempts to deal with in the sense that it is a surplus Budget and removes the pressure of government borrowings, from the general economic community also falls very heavily on the State governments. On the debts of the nation, it is interesting that the States basically carry the national debt. They are the ones that have the long term debt which is funded and must be repaid and they are the ones that bear the greatest burden, in governmental terms, of the high interest rates of today. This national debt places pressures on those governments which they meet only by cutting expenditure, increasing taxes or using loan funds for current expenditure. So many State governments are using very significant sums of loan funds which they obtain with the agreement of the Loan Council for current expenditure that it must be a worry that they should be forced into that area of very difficult financing. The States must then pay, as we know, long term interest on that money.

        I turn now to some of those matters in recent Government decision making, which I said were of minor note, which were not quite so pleasing. I refer first to one item which seems to stand out in the deliberations of the so-called razor gang. I say quite clearly that the imposition of fees for tertiary education second degrees is a very false economy. It is an economy which is depressing the morale of many, often part time, students taking higher degrees who have assumed larger financial burdens by the very fact that they are older. Many of them are married and have heavy expenses. Yet we now expect them to pay a fee for a second degree. In doing so we are saving very little money on the education budget. If my memory is correct, Federal education expenditure this year will be $2.8 billion. I received a letter from the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) to the effect that he expects to save $8m by imposing tertiary fees for second degrees. It is depressing the morale of those people and it is hurting many individuals in this community who save and scrimp, who believe in a free enterprise system and who are out to improve themselves as well as the economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am concerned also at the rather abrupt ending of the Community Youth Support Scheme. I understand the Minister's determination to offer valuable increased training facilities for the youth of Australia. It is a most commendable proposition. But I believe it is less commendable to terminate so abruptly the CYSS scheme when we have involved so many people voluntarily in the community, as individuals or as firms, in support of CYSS organisations. I believe the advice which has been given to honourable members all over the House and to the Minister shows clearly that many individuals among our young unemployed are not suited to partake of the training schemes, however well we may devise them. Whether or not we approve of the education system that perhaps turned them out in that form, the fact is that they exist and we must take the view that they need assistance. I seriously ask the Minister here-as I have done privately-to take note of that issue. Before the CYSS termination date arrives he should give heart and a future to those involved, perhaps by introducing a new, more efficient scheme under a different method of control, but at least a scheme, so that the people who have been assembled all over Australia voluntarily can go on to give their good work and their hearts to meeting this problem as they have done so freely in the past.

        I have previously ventilated in this House by way of a question a matter involving the health scheme which I believe operates most unfairly on more than an insignificant number of Australians. The definition of a disadvantaged person, for the purposes of obtaining a health care card, is set out in the Health Acts Amendment Bill which passed through this House earlier this year. That definition indicates that a person must fill in a form and declare an income. On an assessment of that income he or she either will be given a card or will be denied a card. I have a student in my constituency who relies on some small investments of his own-which he made while he was away from home educating himself-and on the income of his wife. His wife's work is interrupted during the year because of various holidays. The questionnaire which those who are on wages or salaries must fill in requires, for the purposes of adjudicating whether a card will be issued, the person's income in the four weeks immediately prior to the application to be stated. This person came in to see me from the Department of Security office. He said that the previous four weeks salary denied him and his family-he is married with two children-the right to have a health care card, although over the whole year their income was slightly more than $10 a week under the yearly income provided as the qualifying level for the obtaining of a health card. The procedure applied most unfairly. He put this to the officer in the Department of Social Security who said: 'Your wife is going on holiday next month. Wait to apply then'. He came to me and said: 'What sort of a form is this. I happen to support your political party. I am in the third year of my five years of university study. I calculate and budget to the last dollar, yet I have to fill in this form which says that I have to describe my income of the last four weeks, whereas people who are receiving incomes from properties, businesses or self-employment average their incomes over a full year'. Of course the definition of income takes in earnings, sickness or holiday pay, sickness or accident insurance payments and long service leave payments. In a period of four weeks a person might have received a huge payment because of the peculiar way in which these payments arrive in a limited period over a year. I say quite clearly that the Minister must amend that form so that the position is tenable. At the moment I believe something like 100,000 people move in and out of employment every month. Many hundreds of thousands of people in the community, therefore, have a broken income over the year. The procedure is totally untenable for the purpose of finding out whether they are eligible for a most important benefit which could be worth up to $6, $8 or $10 a week-I have forgotten the final figure. Because of that method they are denied the right that people on self-employed incomes have.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have one further extremely small matter to mention. It is so small that I am doubtful about raising it here at all. I raise it because it is a mean-minded matter. During the parliamentary recess I made inquiries in Parliament House in South Australia as I wanted to find out something from the Ministerial Document Service. The State librarian told me that he is no longer a recipient of that service. The Commonwealth has cancelled the sending of statements from the Ministerial Document Service to State parliamentary libraries. There are six such libraries and each time a document is not sent out we are saving a stamp and an envelope. Every Federal member of parliament gets these documents. I thought that this certainly was an oversight. I wrote to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) and I received a letter which stated that State parliamentary libraries would not get the service. The letter stated that they should take out subscriptions to the Commonwealth Record as a substitute. I do not know whether our new federalism is leading us into a conflict in the library area. I thought perhaps this matter was too small to be involved in. It is so small that it obviously defines and delineates the meanness behind it.

         —Every year Budgets arouse the anger of people in all walks of life but this Budget does so more than most. It is a Budget that further divides our community, with divisions on both economic and social lines. The health measures, the termination of tax indexation, the crudely conceived and damaging sales tax measures and the inhumane and incompassionate termination of the Community Youth Support Scheme have met with an outbreak of unprecedented rage in all sections of the community except, of course, from those few privileged friends of the Government. It is a Budget that reasserts obsolete beliefs-beliefs that are not only reminiscent of the nineteenth century but also are socially divisive. Those who are currently the privileged few are the most generously treated in this Budget and those who share the burden of hardship in this society will be required to accept more of the burden. It is as though the Government were looking for measures to reduce the standard of living of the poor and the less affluent of our nation. The regressive nature of these measures will not be as readily forgotten by the electorate as the Government would believe. I think the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) has given notice of the change of the political allegiance of one of his constituents.

        The anger now being displayed will, I believe, persist and ultimately culminate in the destruction of this Government. The true direction of the Government will not be gauged by the pious sentiments of social concern so patronisingly expressed by Government members. Such sentiments are just sugar coating on a very bitter pill. Rather, a more realistic picture of government considerations will be found in the unfeeling dedication to harsh monetarist policies as found in the policy statements of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Budget lines. Ordinary people, the poor, small business people, even the man on the land, will be made to pay the price of this Government's reluctance to test the muscles of its transnational and other powerful friends. It is quite obvious that the coterie of free traders, the current bunch of greedy nouveau riche and the would-be political and economic heavies who adorn the Government back benches have been able to intimidate the Cabinet so that their naive and destructive policies can prevail. But there is no denying the fact that it is the less affluent who will pay the price.

       <para>
        We have witnessed the weeping of volumes of crocodile tears from a number of government members who lamented the imposition of a new range of sales taxes and the increases on other items. Few will be convinced of the sincerity of these lamentations. These members must share the guilt of the Cabinet and the responsibility of decreasing the standard of living of so many Australians. The poor become poorer, difficulties confronting small business become intolerable and the cost squeeze upon these firms will push many of them beyond the threshold of viability.

        One example which has been brought to my notice concerns a rapidly developing industry that should be encouraged. I refer to the mineral water industry in Daylesford, Hepburn Springs and Kyneton. Incredibly this acclaimed health giving water is not grouped with soft drinks, yet drinks such as orange juice and other fruit drinks are exempted from sales tax. When considering the concern that this House has shown one way or another in recent times towards problems associated with alcohol, it is a strange aberration that mineral water should be subject to sales tax. I ask the Treasurer to recognise the arbitrariness of the example and to remove what is an absurd anomaly.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also draw attention to a number of other instances where the Government's sales tax action has created difficulties. I have received letters from many firms and small business people in my electorate of Ballarat protesting about the imposition of new and additional sales taxes. On their behalf I bring their concern to the notice of this House. I exhort the Government to reconsider its ill advised policy before the effects of the taxes result in greater hardship for firms and the employees. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, coming from a rural and provincial area, I think will appreciate the truth of what I am saying. Those people, who come from larger cities where people are more mobile and perhaps where society can withstand the impact of these taxes a little more, will appreciate what I am saying. On their behalf I bring this matter to the notice of the House. Sales tax will impose great hardships on the firms and their employees and hence, of course, upon families. The range of firms concerned is quite dramatic and highlights the degree of dissatisfaction which exists in the electorate and the growing disillusionment which is being felt by many people towards the Government. There is little doubt that many of these people were erstwhile supporters of this Government but they are now recognising that they have been very cynically misused. I assure the house that these people are not longer content to accept the harsh policies of the Government and they have turned against it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another matter of grave concern is a breach of principle in that the Government has seen fit to impose a sales tax on books and other printed matter. It has been raised before-certainly it has been brought to my attention in my electorate-and I will bring it to the attention of the house. It has long been a cherished principle that these items be exempt. The reason is obvious. Restricting the dissemination of information and the opportunities for increasing public knowledge has been abhorrent to all governments. I, along with firms in my electorate, such as Hedges and Bell of Maryborough, one of the largest printers of books in Victoria, and the Ballarat Courier, to mention just two of a large number of concerned firms, are alarmed at the implications of this action. I do not wish to impute motives, other than crude opportunism, to the Government. But the alarm has been sounded and it is up to the Government to allay the fears that are aroused. I do not often find myself in total agreement with the Ballarat Courier editorial, but on Saturday 12 September 1981 it hit the spot. The editorial states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Outside the communist world and other countries controlled by dictatorships, where else but in Australia would you expect to find a tax on the dissemination and exchange of information?
       </para>
       <para>
        The answer simply is: Nowhere else in the Western world, nowhere in countries where freedom of expression is valued; nowhere in countries where freedom to learn is valued as a right.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is incredible that this should be so in Australia! In a country with a Federal Government that prides itself in championing the cause of the individual and his or her freedom.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have our own opinions about that. As we have said, there has never been such a tax in a Western country but our Federal Parliament is now debating a 2.5 per cent sales tax on books, newspapers and magazines. The editorial continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        Understandably there has been an outcry inside and out of Parliament on a measure that is totally against the public interest. And in that interest it is to be hoped the legislation is rejected or withdrawn.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope that will be the case. The article continues but that is the tone of it. This imposition is a matter of grave concern to those people and, I think, all who are interested in the protection of the right of people to the cheapest possible source of information. I suggest that many small country newspapers will find these changes-I have mentioned a number of them-difficult to absorb. On a point of principle and economically, this tax is offensive.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today the Treasurer quoted figures-I will draw attention to the housing problem-to avoid the obvious charge that housing ownership in Australia was not buoyant. It is estimated that the additional cost of building materials will add $500 to the cost of a very modest house of $20,000. That is extraordinarily modest these days. These additional costs will put paid to the hopes of many young couples to own their own homes. That is obvious. The statistics referred to today by the Treasurer in the House in no way get to the problem that faces individual young people who are trying to gain a house. It is no credit to the Treasurer to try to deny it. It indicates what little understanding he has of the way young people have to watch their budgets. As has been said, it is a very regressive tax. It hurts people on low incomes more than the wealthy. Fewer homes being built means fewer people employed in the building industry. In my electorate activity in the building industry is well below full pace. This will certainly not help it to recover. I am concerned about a healthy economy for provincial cities and small towns.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reverberations are felt right throughout the entire economy and it suffers. People are being forced out of the private housing market, both through failed hopes and/or bankruptcy. They are being forced to seek public housing. This move will put pressure on rental markets and the Victorian Housing Commission and aggravate the already serious problem. Already in Ballarat alone 350 families are on the list for public housing. This does not account for people in towns such as Maryborough, Kyneton and Daylesford who are waiting for public housing. This is a very serious matter in general terms. But I stress that in rural and provincial areas such as mine it will have disastrous effects on very many people. There is evidence already of reduced building activity. I will cite a case indicating that in a moment. The figures for Victoria show that there are 16,813 applicants for housing commission homes. Some of these people will have to wait five years or more. We can expect that that time span will increase and that the number of applicants will also increase. It is estimated that the number of low income earners living in poverty in private rental accommodation is around 200,000. This surely must shock us out of our complacency and force us to recognise that that must become a top priority for this nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want also to bring to the attention of honourable members the problem of a small business in my electorate. The Government has asserted so often that it is the friend of small business. The managing director of one small business in Ballarat, Eureka Timber Co. Pty Ltd, wrote to me as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am writing to ask you to do your utmost to have the 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on building materials withdrawn. This sales tax could well be the last straw. The State Electricity Commission has just raised their charges by 20 per cent. The State Government through the Forestry Commission has just raised our royalty rate by 12 1/2 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is as though the two governments have combined to destroy the building industry and the sawmilling industry-both very labour intensive industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The dream that every young Australian has had in the past of being able to own a house of his or her own may well become just that-a dream, a thing that used to happen but will happen less and less. It cannot even be argued that this move is anti-inflationary. It is obvious that it is close to inflationary.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask you most earnestly, along with the 24 men getting their daily bread from this small business, and who want to continue to do so, and not go on the dole, which will be their future if we are taxed out of the market place, to do your utmost, to stop this iniquitous tax from being implemented.
       </para>
       <para>
        That letter is signed by J. L. Corrigan, the managing director. That is only one of the many letters of that kind which I have received and which I am sure many honourable members, probably mostly from this side of the House, have received. Honourable members can see that that puts paid to the hopes of so many young people.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the last few moments available to me I want to raise the matter of the Community Youth Support Scheme. Among the many cynical acts of the present Federal Government the abandonment of this scheme must register as one of the most infamous. There is no evidence that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) has any appreciation of the plight of young people enrolled in CYSS projects across the country. I applaud the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) and so many other honourable members for raising this matter. This is one of the issues which the Government obviously slipped through and thought that no one would notice. These young people are important. They have a right to their own dignity. They have a right to the future. Many of them are kids with problems. Many experience problems of adjustment. They are not necessarily kids to be taken up in projects which the Minister suggests are in the pipeline. He claims that there are training programs for the people. In fact, no more than 5,750 of the places in those programs will suit CYSS participants. Yet, over the period of a year there were something like 62,000 people going through CYSS.
       </para>
       <para>
        I shall make reference to a number of comments recently published in the Ballarat Courier in which both employers and ex-CYSS participants indicated the value of the work that could be done by a well-run CYSS project. The CYSS projects were successful in spite of the lack of real interest by the Government. They were successful because of the dedication of the people who were in charge and who took an interest in them. They deserve the congratulations of the Australian community.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have, for instance, some comments from Melanie, who believed that CYSS was good. She said that there was plenty to do, that there were skills to learn and that it helped build up confidence. She said CYSS should definitely be retained. Of course, the Government did not consider the opinions of CYSS participants as having any bearing upon the decision to axe the scheme. Belatedly it says it is interested. We will see. Melanie's employer said that she was an excellent worker and did her job well. He said that he had been considering employing another junior and if he did he would go ahead and approach the CYSS group. Of course, one of the sad state of affairs is that there will be no CYSS any more. Another lass, Sharon, said the worst part of being unemployed was having nothing to do. She said that CYSS helped her to fill that gap. She said it offered her a lot of work experience and skills. She is now working as a teachers aide at McCallum House, which is an institution for the mentally disabled in Ballarat.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is my belief and the belief of many involved with CYSS in my electorate and certainly the belief of my colleagues that the Federal Government has simply discarded these young people. In Daylesford, Kyneton and Maryborough and other towns that do not face the prospect of any rapid industrial development the plight of these young people will become pitiful. These towns are progressive and they are self-starting. But in the current economic climate they are confronted by a tough task. The young people in these CYSS projects are not readily absorbed into the work force of those towns. With the termination of these projects their fortunes are bleak. I have asked the Victorian Minister responsible for youth affairs, Mr Dixon, to take over the CYSS projects if the Federal Government falls short of its responsibility to these young people. If the Government has even a shred of compassion for these young people and the thousands like them across the nation it must reinstate the CYSS program. Sure, it must review it and update it; any responsible government would do that.

The Government's Budget for 1981-82 is insensitive and inhumane. The protests from the Australian public are loud and clear. It is to be hoped that the Government will rethink the direction it has taken and, in a contrite mood, make the changes so desperately needed to rekindle faith in government lost since it embarked upon its narrowly conceived direction.

         —The thrust of this Budget is to contain inflation, to contain wage demands, to ease interest rates, to maintain a steady growth in the private sector and to shift the tax base and provide for reductions in personal taxation in the future. We should note the importance of the last point, which is to shift the tax base. I do not think there is any dispute about these objectives. I am quite sure that, in due course, they will be achieved. Australia has been called, many times, the lucky country. There is no doubt that Australia is one of the strongest and safest countries in the world in terms of our economy, in terms of our currency and in terms of our future prospects. Although things can always be better, I do not think we should forget how good they are in this country for most people.

        I wish in the time allowed to comment on certain aspects of the Budget. I will be critical of some and in favour of others. Whilst I am critical of some aspects I recognise that the Budget strategy is based on a complete package of decisions and to change any of those decisions would be to erode that strategy. I hope that the comments I make will be taken into account in the near future. I turn firstly to sales tax. The sales tax proposals have attracted a great deal of criticism. No one wants to see himself or his business adversely affected by these proposals. There is certain justification in criticising some of the items which will be subjected to sales tax. I refer in particular to clothing and footwear, commercial boats and items connected with the building industry. I agree with some of that criticism. I would prefer to see the sales tax concentrated on what might be called more luxurious items because it is difficult for low income earners to cope with this extra burden. There are others in the community in the higher income brackets who are much better placed to cope with this impost. I view with some alarm the imposition of sales tax on commercial boats because it concerns people who have contracted forward to take delivery of a boat. I am very sceptical of the retrospectivity provisions in relation to sales tax. I am also critical of sales tax being imposed on items in the building industry. This industry is vital to our economy. This impost, coming as it does on top of the high interest rates, will affect many home buyers as well as the people who are in the building industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to say a few words about the pensioners in our community. I am very disappointed about the way in which they have been treated. We are constantly told that the aged in our community are becoming an increasing welfare burden within the terms of the Budget. Whilst that might be true I point out that it is not exactly the fault of those people that they are getting old and it is not exactly their fault that there are more of them. I fully agree with the Government's desire to move against the blatant schemes in which some pensioners are indulging. I hope that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) will move with sympathy and understanding. I would like to see him catch those people who are manipulating the system. I point out that we have indexation of pensions but that we do not have indexation of the extra income allowed to pensioners which for a single pensioner is limited now to $20 and for those who want a health card is limited to $40. Neither of these limits has moved for some years. The problem is that almost everything else is indexed, whether it be pensions or wages. We have here two static benchmarks that have not moved for some years. I believe that this is unjust.
       </para>
       <para>
        Pensioners with limited means are getting very angry, and I do not blame them. Let me give an example. For every dollar that a pensioner earns over the $20 upper income limit he loses 50c out of his pension. By earning $14 a week extra a pensioner moves into the tax bracket of 32c in the dollar. When he earns $21 he loses not only 50c out of his pension but also, if he is in the lower income bracket, another 32c in tax. The fact is that out of $1 he retains something like 18c. I ask whether that is considered to be fair. If the $20 limit was considered good enough in 1972 I think the figure that is considered good enough in 1981 should be somewhat higher. I fully support the principle of not giving the old age pension to those who do not need it but in the process let us not further disadvantage those who have a genuine need. I and many other members of this House will be watching with great interest to see the proposals brought forward by the Minister in the next few weeks.
       </para>
       <para>
        I deal now with aged persons homes. I am very pleased to see that an extra $12m has been allocated for this purpose in this year's Budget. It brings the total allocation for this item to $58m. One of the problems I have in my area concerns the fact that we form part of the Moreton South region in terms of nursing beds. That region works on a basis of providing something like 50 beds for every 1,000 people over 65 years of age. On the basis of that figure my area is disadvantaged to the extent of some 900 beds. We have 900 beds; on that formula there should be another 900 beds. I make a plea that the formula and the regional boundaries be revised so that people in my area, which could be regarded as a high age area, are given a fair go.

        One of the other problems which I wish to mention concerns Telecom Australia. I see that the interest rate paid by Telecom to the Government is to be increased. The problem is that the Gold Coast area is a large growth area and Telecom has not been able to provide the infrastructure to keep up with that growth. I ask that Telecom sort out its priorities so that in 1981 it is not considered an extraordinary request to ask Telecom to put on a telephone. I must say that the local office of Telecom has been doing its best. I say also, with some degree of satisfacton, that the problem looks like being overcome within the next six months.

        Mention has been made of the Community Youth Support Scheme. I agree with what people have said since I have been in the chamber over the last hour or so. In Queensland generally, and in my area in particular, this has been an excellent scheme. The three centres in my area have been good and I will be sorry to see them go. Overall the scheme has not been a success and the Government has determined that it will change the thrust of training for young people. To that effect a considerable amount of money has been allocated in the Budget to the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. The amount has increased, in fact, by 22 per cent to $203m. The allocation of trade training is $76m. The allocations for skills training and youth training have gone up. Some 235,000 people will be assisted under these programs. I agree with the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) and others who have said that these programs will not cater for everyone who has been part of CYSS. I tend to think that this is true. I will wait with interest to see the outcome of the investigations now being made by the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. I take this opportunity to thank publicly all those who have been associated with the CYSS centres in my area.

        With some regret I must say that I believe that the States are not getting a fair share of road funds. We live in a largely decentralised country with a huge road problem. The problem is that the amount of money going to the States is barely enough to maintain those roads, let alone improve them. On a more positive side I am particularly pleased that defence spending is to rise in real terms by over 5 per cent. It is very easy to say, as many people do, that there is no threat to Australia. It is very difficult right now to identify any threat but it is there. It becomes more pertinent to talk about a threat if our defences are run down. If a very high level of professionalism in the defence forces is not maintained, men will be lost. Unfortunately, that has happened in past years. Once the defence forces run down it takes a long time to build them up. I am very glad to see that the defence forces budget has been increased substantially this year.

        Turning to education, I am afraid that I cannot agree with my colleague the honourable member for Boothby that the introduction of fees for universities is a poor thing. I fully support the Government in the action it took before the Budget, although it is a budgetary matter. I am particularly glad to see that step being taken because, if there is only so much money to go around, I want to see more of it going into technical and trade training. In particular, I want to see a situation where a young person who qualifies at school for university can go there and get a first degree free. At the same time, there are hundreds and thousands of our young people who do not want to follow the pure academic trend and who want to get a trade. I want to see a situation where these young people do not have to go around, cap in hand, trying to find an employer to take them on. I want to see those who qualify being able to go to the local technical college and get a trade in the same way as their colleagues can go to a university and get a first degree. I believe it is very important that that opportunity be given to people. I do not for one moment hold with the theory that one can get a trade only on the job. Some of the most sought after apprentices in Australia have gone through trade training schools in the Services, where most of the training is college-based.

        On the question of foreign aid, it is pleasing to see that the Government has increased the percentage of gross domestic product to foreign aid. There has been a lot of criticism about this, particularly in my home State of Queensland. The fact is that it is a very modest figure. As a middle ranking power in the world we have responsibilities to those who are less fortunate. I fully support that move. On the subject of veterans' affairs, the fact that merchant mariners who served in war theatres have now been brought in out of the cold, so to speak, has been a major success of this Budget. They have been out there since 1945. There has been some degree of criticism as to whether they should be in or out and that is what has delayed this move. On balance, I believe they should be in, and that is where they are now. Another important budgetary measure is the granting of disability pensions to the Papua New Guinea constabulary. It can be argued that they should be paid out of our large foreign aid grants to Papua New Guinea, and that might be a valid arguement. Nevertheless, I am delighted to see that these pensions have been granted because I do not think what Australia owes to the people who served in that constabulary during World War II should ever be forgotten.

        I turn now to the question of personal taxation. The fact is-I think it is freely admitted on both sides of this House-that it is far too high. It is destroying incentive; it is destroying people's will and capacity to work.

         —I am talking about Australia. The fact is that it is also encouraging higher wage demands. Perhaps my friend will care to answer that later on. Pay-as-you-earn receipts during the coming year will increase by 22 per cent. Unfortunately, to some degree we are hitting those whom we are also hitting with sales tax. To date there has been no trade-off in terms of reductions in personal tax. Too many people are approaching the 46 per cent tax bracket. The average weekly earning is now something like $300 a week. If it goes up by 10 per cent it will move into the second tax bracket. The Treasury estimate of wage rises this year is something like 13.5 per cent. I ask: Is there any justice in this when one is paying almost half one's salary into a tax system? On several occasions the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has said that the personal tax system is to be revised. We look forward to that.

        One of the other problems associated with tax, although not personal tax, concerns the plight of private companies in Australia. As we all know, they are obliged by legislation to distribute something like 40 per cent of their profits. This simply means that no private company can expand. We should be encouraging them, not discouraging them, to take in their families as partners and expand their businesses. As it is, just about all of them remain static or fold or, more to the point, are taken over. When the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System is brought down, I ask the Treasurer, to have a good look at the matter, in conjunction with another important matter I wish to raise, double taxation on small shareholders. One of the previous speakers-I think it was the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly)-was talking about Trust Australia. I fully support his views on this matter. I am well aware that in some ways what I have been advocating is more spending in terms of pensioners, et cetera, and that it could be asked where we will make the cuts. I am talking about reassessing some of our priorities within the Budget. I fully support the move to indirect taxes. I look forward to seeing the other half of this contract, that is, reduction in personal tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I reiterate that I believe we have a strong economy-probably one of the strongest, if not the strongest, in the world. Wages have risen in real terms by some 4 per cent over the last 12 months. Investment has increased by 20 per cent and inflation is contained at 8.8 per cent. That is the way we want to keep it. Overseas money is coming in, and the Labor Party has been extremely critical about this overseas capital and where it is going. I ask, and I have not had an answer to this question, where we would be if this overseas capital did not come in. The fact is that if it were not here, the pressure on our domestic money market would be much greater. As it stands, it appears that interest rates have peaked, and that is part of the Budget strategy. There will be no development in this country without confidence, and confidence requires stability. The Budget plans for stability, and in that way and because of that I fully support it.

         — From the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) down, this Government has sought, in explaining the 1981-82 Budget, to justify it on the grounds of small government. The evidence is that the rhetoric and ideology highlight the fact that the closest the Fraser Cabinet has come to small government is in the small-minded decisions that have been taken. The Australian public has been bombarded with rhetoric by the Prime Minister for over six years. On many occasions he has been guilty of saying one thing and doing the opposite. The reality is that the latest Budget will not reduce overall costs to the community. In fact, the opposite will be the case. We all remember the words of the Prime Minister: 'People will be free to decide how they will spend their money. We will reduce taxation. People should be free to decide how they will spend their money rather than having the Government take the decisions for them through heavier taxation burdens.' They are great words, but what are the facts? Have taxes been reduced? Have Australians more money to spend? The only way those questions can be answered with a yes is if one is already a wealthy member of our society, but this is not so with average Australians.

        For the term of the Fraser Government there has been a marked redistribution of wealth from the poor to the wealthy. For average Australians taxes under this Government are rising faster than income. Pay-as-you-earn taxpayers contributed 16.1 per cent more tax last year than in the year before, when they paid 17 per cent more than in the year before that. This Budget estimates that the rise will continue unabated. The increase in 1981-82 will be 22 per cent. On top of this, sales tax increases will cost the public $892m. Taxes under Fraser are now equal to 28.8 per cent of gross domestic product.

         —Taxes under Mr Fraser, the Prime Minister, are now equal to 28.8 per cent of gross domestic product. This is the same Government which thundered about high taxes in the Whitlam years. Under Whitlam, taxes as a proportion of gross domestic product were 24 1/2 per cent. I refer to a speech made in this House by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) on 27 August. He referred to figures of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. He said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Let us look at the simple question of revenue from taxes as a proportion of gross domestic product for the OECD countries. One will see that Australia's revenue from taxes in 1978 is listed as totalling 28.8 per cent of gross domestic product.
       </para>
       <para>
        He compared Australia with countries such as Canada with a figure of 31 per cent, France with 39 per cent, Germany with almost 38 per cent and the Netherlands with 46 per cent, to justify the claim that the Fraser Government is a low taxing government. Even though Government supporters claim that in the Whitlam years taxes were high, the figures I have cited show that the present Government's rate of taxation as a proportion of gross domestic product is much higher than it ever was under the Whitlam Government. Who will be the beneficiaries of this Budget and the money that is being collected? The first and major recipients will be members of the Fraser Cabinet, who see this Budget as the gateway to the 1983 election. The domestic surplus of $1,500m is aimed at slugging the community now in order to reduce taxes and offer election incentives in the future. Why should I believe that? The Treasurer (Mr Howard) admitted as much in his Budget Speech. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of the new revenue proposals will help broaden the tax base and this will enhance the potential for further personal tax relief in future years.
       </para>
       <para>
        How absolutely cynical can one get. The Treasurer referred to 'the potential for further personal tax relief'. For the whole period of the Fraser Government personal taxes have continued to rise. There is no such thing as further relief; relief has not even started. Personal taxes increased by 17 per cent in 1979-80, 16 per cent in 1980-81 and 22 per cent in 1981-82. When is there to be any personal tax relief as promised in the rhetoric of this dishonest and deceitful Government? How ignorant does this Government believe the public is? In the very next paragraph of the Treasurer's speech he again showed how cynical the Government is. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to measures to contain expenditure and broaden the tax base, the Government is continuing its efforts to stamp out tax avoidance.
       </para>
       <para>
        How hollow is this statement when the Budget Papers show that the enforcement section of the Australian Taxation Office will decline by 179 officers. The enforcement section is concerned with tax evasion, the understatement of income and the new lodgment of returns. On 20 May of this year the Treasurer told Parliament that the amount of tax outstanding at the end of 1979-80 from taxpayers participating in avoidance schemes was $711m compared with $433m for 1978-79 and $158m for the year before. Clearly the amounts outstanding have been increasing, yet this Government is cutting staff in the taxation enforcement area. I quote again from the Treasurer's speech. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is continuing its efforts to stamp out tax avoidance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Does this statement equate with a cut in the availability of enforcement officers? Just how sincere is this Government? The evidence is that whilst it believes it can milk honest Australians dry with tax increases, tax avoiders have little to fear from this Government. I will spend a little time on the Budget strategy. Not too many people are clear as to what the strategy is, least of all Government members opposite. I refer to the speech by the pretender to the leadership of the Liberal Party, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). He was not very praiseworthy of the Budget. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the burden of its achievement will fall most heavily on those least able to afford it-such as young families wishing to purchase their first home and families with low earned incomes or statutory incomes. The average family has been faced in the past 12 months with increasing taxes and charges on all fronts-higher interest rates, higher petrol prices, higher health charges and now higher sales tax across the board with little or no compensating increase in real disposable income.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Budget is designed to increase taxes and charges at a faster rate than the growth in government spending. Clearly, many members on the Government side believe that. In simple terms the Government will collect $1,500m more in taxes from the people of Australia than it intends to spend. Many of them will be knocking off work now. They probably collected their pay today and looked at how much tax they paid. The Government is taking a percentage that it does not intend to spend. At this point it is worth reconsidering the Prime Minister's words which I quoted at the beginning of my speech. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        People should be free to decide how they will spend their money rather than having the Government take the decision for them through heavier taxation burdens.
       </para>
       <para>
        What better way can that be illustrated than by what the Government is doing at present? This Budget has introduced a new element-savings through the public sector by conscription. A Budget surplus is in reality a means of banking funds on behalf of taxpayers. How hypocritical can the Government be? In reality the Government is increasing taxes and charges and adding insult to injury by putting the money it is collecting into consolidated revenue and reducing public services. How much do average Australians have to suffer to make room in this country for foreign investors? That is something this Government has been saying for four or five years. According to the monetarists, a domestic surplus is important to reduce the pressure on interest rates. However, in the year just concluded a domestic surplus of $400m was achieved. Interest rates have never been higher and families have never been worse off.
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of this Budget strategy will be to draw millions of dollars from the community expenditure stream, creating unnecessary hardship. For what? Is not the thrust of the Budget to bring the money supply under control? Why attack average Australians? The Budget is still being debated in this House. Already we have seen a change of direction in the Government's strategy. The Reserve Bank of Australia has given a direction to banks to lend another $900m. In the Prime Minister's own words, would it not have been much better for ordinary Australians not to have had these taxes imposed upon them so that they could have kept their interest free money in their own pockets and spent it as they chose, rather than a direction being given by the Government a couple of weeks after the Budget was brought down for the banks to lend the same money with interest? Who will get the money? Who will spend it? It will not be the ordinary person who has paid his tax today out of his pay cheque. Those who can afford to go to the bank and pay high rates of interest will be able to use that money. The Government is effectively taking it from the poor, transferring it to the banks and allowing them to lend it to other people who can afford to borrow it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is there an alternative? I say there is. Why not control the inflow of speculative capital that has brought the Government to this position? It has made decisions and has had to change them even before the Budget has been passed. The failure to control speculative money is putting pressures on the economy which will jeopardise many industries. Clearly, when investment spending is the major pressure point in the economy investment allowances and subsidies should be readjusted and abolished in many industries. I refer to pages 17 and 18 of the ministerial statement on the report of the razor gang. Dealing with investment allowances and taxation concessions, the statement read:
       </para>
       <para>
        Taxation concessions for industry, which are equivalent in all practical senses to direct expenditures from the Budget, have also been reviewed and we have decided to reduce a number of currently available concessions.
       </para>
       <para>
        This section is only a small part of the whole document. It continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government . . . believes that some reductions in the level of taxation concessions available to industry are essential if the burden of containing the public sector is to be shared by all groups in the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the areas where industry is to take part of the burden. I refer to an article by Mr Eric Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association. He said that this was the worst Budget in 34 years. The article stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        When Sir Phillip Lynch's committee was appointed, it was to cut waste and duplications from government functions. Legislation-by-reporting as a means of making tax increases wasn't what it was all about.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from broken promises, one change is ridiculous and not worth doing! Things like the Investment Allowance were trimmed from 20 per cent to 18 per cent, and effective immediately.
       </para>
       <para>
        As for one depreciation change: Frankly it would be simply a giggle if it didn't have costly implications-not in the amount of tax involved (because that's chicken-feed) but in the amount of work involved for taxpayers and the Taxation Office. Depreciation schedules will now be up to three-times larger than before, and that waste in time and effort will continue for 10 to 15 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Did the so-called Razor Gang ear-mark some money saved, to give it to the Taxation Office for extra assessors and more storage space?
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Risstrom said that it should have. But we know from the Budget Papers that the opposite is the case. There are fewer taxation assessors. Mr Risstrom then gives an example of what was adopted. He says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Only last August, in the 1980 Budget, depreciation rates were lifted by one-fifth to allow for obsolescence, but over the life of the item there's no more tax saved, and no long-term revenue cost.
       </para>
       <para>
        That 1/5th adjustment has been cut back to (wait for it) 18/100ths, and you'll be 'fair tickled' to learn that the 13.5 per cent rate is to be precisely 13.275 per cent. What does such a big and important cost-cutting change mean?
       </para>
       <para>
        He then gives this example:
       </para>
       <para>
        A manufacturer buys a lathe for $5,000 mid-year; its a 5 per cent prime-cost item. An 1/5th-up rate of 6 per cent would allow depreciation if $150, but with a grand stroke--
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, by this Government-
       </para>
       <para>
        that's down to 5.9 per cent (18/100ths onto 5 per cent): the claim drops to $148!
       </para>
       <para>
        For a company, it means extra tax of less than $1 a year! And a sole trader (income of less than $18,000) will pay 64 cents extra tax for the year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Risstrom said: 'Frankly that fiddling little change is ludicrous'. I totally agree with him. Let me quote the alternative. Let me quote again the words of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). In his reply to the Budget Speech he put the case on behalf of Australians and his words should be repeated. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        A balanced domestic budget, or even a mild deficit, is what is required at this time. Certainly, the economy can afford it and it would be consistent with falling inflation, lower interest rates, and sustained growth of 5 per cent, provided controls are imposed immediately on short term speculative money from overseas. That is, we are talking about making domestic economic activity by Australians by allowing money to be made available to them rather than foreign carpetbaggers speculating in real estate, shares and in Australian industry to the detriment of Australians' welfare and security.
       </para>
       <para>
        We would immediately abandon the proposed sales tax increases. This would leave $550m in family pay packets to go into consumer spending.
       </para>
       <para>
        How true that is today. Already the Government has decided to allow the banks to put that money back into the system after this Government has taken it out of the people's taxes and to lend it back to the wealthy who can afford to borrow it. That is a great sort of policy, that is. The Australian Labor Party would not be afraid to protect the assets of Australians. The Leader of the Opposition has indicated clearly that an alternative approach is available, and it is certainly practical.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at some of the indirect effects of this Budget. I again quote from the speech of the former Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Kooyong. He had this to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important that government economic policies allow for progressive improvement of the economy without excessive expansion or excessive contraction.
       </para>
       <para>
        He is having a go at the Government again. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        An economically efficient and socially humane approach to management of the national economy involves smooth and timely changes of gear. Flexibility is, of course, essential but it should not be at the expense of the stability people hope to find in Liberal as opposed to Labor Party management.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased to see that he put in the words 'hope to find'. People are not finding it at present. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>

       </para>

        Of course they should receive more room to move. But what have they got from this Government? They have got nothing but the squeeze from this Government. We all saw the farce of the Premiers Conferences. There is no doubt that this Government is divided, very divided, over this Budget and the methods that have been used in it.

         —I have just gone through what the honourable member for Kooyong said. In one little part of his speech he made four or five solid criticisms of the Government, but of course he did not mention how to achieve his call for small government. The honourable member for Kooyong left it at that after discussing the fact that the States are being squeezed. Let me expand on his words in that regard. He said:

        'Quite enough', says the honourable member for North Sydney. But who will have to provide the extra funds? Having already provided $1,500m to the Federal Government, which the Government does not intend to spend, average Australians will have to pay again in increased State charges. One only has to look at the State Electricity Commission in Victoria to see what has gone on. I quote an article in the Age of 19 August. Mr Trethowan, the Chairman of the SEC, is reported as saying this:
       </para>
       <para>
        Our capital works programme this year is worth $620 million, but the Federal Government gave us the right to borrow only $308 million and that left us to find an extra $312 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        We've racked our brains to find ways of doing it, but we have been forced to increase our tariffs to meet the shortfall.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, this Federal Government has forced the State governments once again to hit those people who are paying all the time. The State Government of Victoria has brought down a Budget which, because of the policies of the Federal Government, is estimated to cost families in that State an extra $7 a week. No doubt the pressures of this Government will be felt all over the country.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, let met look at a couple of small points. There are groups in this community who have been completely ignored, such as the Community Youth Support Scheme groups and the young people in those groups. Many honourable members have mentioned that something should be done about it, but this Government is sitting pat. I hope that pressure brought to bear before the end of October will ensure that something will be done for these people. Another matter I want to raise in the minute I have left concerns the blind and the blind day centres. At the moment, people in Victoria are working and trying to raise money towards putting in day centres to which blind people can be brought and trained. This Government has completely ignored that area. The Act concerning those centres was brought into this House by the Whitlam Government and the fact that the Act needs amending has been put to this Government many times, but the Government has totally ignored that fact for the six years it has been in office. I urge this Government to take a really good look at where it is spending its money and to amend that legislation and to make funds available to those people who are trying to help the blind in our community so that they can have some of the facilities required to rehabilitate them back into the community.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, before I commence my remarks on the Budget, I draw attention to the fact that your very worthy predecessor, a much loved member of this House, is in the chamber. Sometimes when I visualise him in that chair I get a warm and comfortable feeling, but other times I shudder with apprehension. If I do not point to one other matter tonight, the matter I will discuss will have well merited the particular slot I have in this Budget debate. It is the matter of zone allowances, or the revision of them. The people of Queensland, other than perhaps those who live in the metropolitan area, have always been concerned about the manner in which the zone allowance boundaries were first established and then, over a period, how the particular advantage in those areas was whittled away to a point where it was not of any great significance. So over the years we had hoped, and prayed a little perhaps, that someone might be aware of the disadvantages which exist as one gets further from the more populated, the more favoured, areas. Then came the news that there was to be an inquiry to revise the whole system of zone allowances.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        People who live beyond the great metropolitan areas, particularly those in my State, became fired with a hope that through this instrumentality we would have the opportunity of exposing to all those concerned-not just the Government but also those living in more favoured areas-the very grave and continuing difficulties we have to contend with. They are very profound problems. For example, we put up with temperatures of between 90 degrees and 100 degrees. Not so long ago it was said that Europeans could not live in such conditions. I do not know whether it was thought that non-Europeans were inferior. If it was, thank God it is a thing of the past-or I hope it is. That was the attitude towards such climatic conditions. But we live in them; we tolerate them.

        Let me now compare the costs of ordinary commodities sold in Brisbane with those sold in a town called Richmond. Why do I choose Richmond? I could have chosen any town. It is quite remarkable how much one has to pay when one gets 100 miles away from the city. For example, a 67 kilogram bag of flour, which may be used to make bread or pumpkin scones, cost $20 in Brisbane, or so I am led to believe. In Richmond it costs $27.68. That is 30 per cent more. Let us look at the price of a bag of cement, a fundamental requirement. If one wants to build houses, roads or curbing and channelling a bag of cement is very important. For a bag of cement in Townsville-closer to the isolated areas-one pays $62 but in Richmond a person pays an extra $55. Would honourable members believe that? I could go on and on. With the present price competition a motorist pays 33c or 34c a litre for petrol in Brisbane. The price in isolated areas is 42c to 45c. This illustrates the increasing difficulties in which people have to live and survive in isolated areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Along came the great deal. Because of great concern a committee of inquiry was established to examine all these conditions. We hoped that at long last a committee of people who should have a desire to appreciate these conditions would put in a report which at least drew attention to the difficulties. But what happened? I am supremely confident that the Government will do as it did with the recommendations in regard to general aviation, and toss any findings straight into the wastepaper basket. Except for a very few recommendations, most of the findings of that committee of inquiry are totally unreal and, if anything, would further penalise the people of the inland if implemented. For example, the city of Mount Isa, because it has more than 25,000 people, goes into another category and the people lose whatever advantages they had. Being reclassified from Zone A to zone B means a loss of all advantages. Fancy telling a group of miners who slave underground, a group of people who live in the most shocking conditions, that the result of the inquiry is that they may be further penalised. I again say that I am supremely confident that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) will have no part in these recommendations and will put them where they belong-in the wastepaper basket.

        I now refer to a terribly important subject. One may say: 'What has the beef industry got to do with the Budget?' Just take the beef industry away from the Budget and have a look at the balance sheet. The beef industry is worth about $1 billion to this country. Some sneaky, criminal types decided to put over a bit of a lurk. Somewhere along the line of distribution they decided to sneak in some horse meat, and perhaps a few pieces of kangaroo meat here and there. It was not just a matter of the money that was involved. It was a matter of discrediting this country in the eyes of the greatest and most substantial friend we have on earth, the United States. I had the advantage last week of discussing these matters in Washington with Gardiner Murray, our veterinarian attache. I also had the advantage of talking to a fellow named Burton Eller, who was the senior vice-president of the National Cattlemen's Association. I was quite amazed at the reaction of the American Cattlemen's Association. I thought they would be jumping with glee. As I said to Burton Eller, I thought that, of all people, members of the Cattlemen's Association would be saying to themselves: 'This is the end of the threat we have from the thousands of tonnes of Australian beef that come into this country'. Their attitude was entirely different. They explained it by saying: 'We provide the more prime cuts; you people provide the sort of beef that is used for our hamburger chains'. But I could not find a hamburger chain that was not, in a subtle way, indicating that it would not have any part of Australian beef. That sort of thing happened with Wendy's-that is a hamburger group, by the way; do not misunderstand me-Jack in the Box, Burger King and McDonalds. They all had a sign exhibited to this effect: 'We provide only American domestic beef'. Their message was loud and clear. I got into a bus one day wearing a broad brimmed hat, and the driver said: 'Where are you from?' I said: 'I am from Australia'. He said: 'You must be a horse breeder'. My reply to him would have done credit to any bullock driver way back in the old days.
       </para>
       <para>
        I said to Burton Eller: 'Obviously we will have a tapering-off of our trade'. He is the spokesman for the most powerful group of cattle breeders in the United States. He said: 'No, I do not think there will be. There might be a temporary recession but, in any case, I think your beef will be re-channelled from the chains of hamburgers shops and go into the supermarkets-and ABC and so on'. It would seem that we have overcome what could have been a great difficulty. But our people and people such as Burton Eller said: 'For Heaven's sake, get whoever is responsible and make an example of him'. As far as I am concerned, such people should be eliminated from the industry for ever and a day and never again be permitted to have any part of the beef cattle industry. They should be penalised to the new letter of the law. Let us revise the Act before we deal with them. Give them the greatest penalty.

        As my friend on my left, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton), realises, we have a very serious problem in relation to the defence of this country. I must commend the Government for the increased funding of defence. It is considerable; it is tremendously helpful. I am sure it has had a big effect on the morale of the three branches of the Service. So far, so good. But I say, with the greatest sense of responsibility, that I had the advantage of discussions with the Chairman of the United States Senate Armed Services Committee, a fellow named Senator John Tower, and another gentleman named Melvin Price, who was the Chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, and various other people. I thank the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) who helped me tremendously in arranging these discussions. The discussions were helpful and dealt with niceties and the exchange of goodwill and so on. But the discussions that really mattered were held in Hawaii. My goodness, one has to look at a map to realise, as I must confess I did not, that the Pacific Basin encompasses such a huge and significant area. In Hawaii I had the great advantage of talking to Admiral Long who is Commander-in-Chief not only of the huge Pacific area but also of the Indian Ocean and beyond. We talked about Baluchistan, about the Arabian Gulf and about other matters. It was a long briefing. He had assembled other people; for example, Rear Admiral Chewning who is in charge of planning.
       </para>
       <para>
        This briefing went on for many hours. Out of it emerged some fairly sobering thoughts. The Soviet Union regards its intrusion and its ambitions in the Pacific and Indian Ocean areas so highly that it has established a command headquarters in Siberia which is every bit the equal of the Warsaw command headquarters. Prowling around at this moment in the Pacific Ocean would be not less than 30 fully-armed, modern, new generation submarines, and the same number would be in the Indian Ocean. The Soviet Union has the most modern aircraft possible scattered around the area at various bases which it has obtained either through satellite countries or under the guise of having an alliance with some country or another. It has increased its ground forces by 300 per cent. So there is this huge preponderance of mighty strength distributed through the Pacific and Indian Ocean areas. But we say to ourselves: 'Perhaps we will allow the Americans to put a few B52s into this country'. I am speaking as an individual now and not as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, because that Committee has a bipartisan distribution of views on this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        My personal view, having heard the evidence I heard over the last week or 10 days, is that if we are not going to have a country such as the United States poised in a suitable strategic position to help us in case of an emergency, who in God's name are we going to have? Is it better to be red than dead or is it better to be dead than red? We can take our pick. I think everyone in this chamber at the moment would not hesitate to make the choice. We are totally dependent on an ally, but we are saying to that ally: 'We will allow you to bring in a few B52s and to do the occasional surveillance trip over the Indian Ocean, but for heaven's sake do not bring any arms or anything that will threaten those poor Soviet submarines that are prowling around the oceans. Hands off them'. We have to be realistic. Hang it all, we have to forget our politics in this thing, become completely united and face up to a threat which is there and which is increasing in its intensity.

       <para>
        I turn now to an entirely different subject-the funding of the film industry. I go from a very sober contribution to this debate to one with perhaps a little more levity. While I was in New York I saw in the New York Times a full page advertisement telling the people of New York that because of the demand to see a film called Gallipoli it would be screened 24 hours a day. The advertisement was not in the other New York newspaper, which would have been more understandable because, after all, Mr Murdoch did have something to do with the making of the film. I believe it is the first time in New York that a film has been screened 24 hours a day to allow the people who want to see it to do so.

        Late one night I sat up and watched a discussion panel made up of people associated with culture in various ways-film making, music, other arts and so on. The film representative said: 'We have some very good films around at the moment, but we have one that is outstanding and has everything. It is far superior to anything we have seen for a long time. It is a movie called Breaker Morant'. Honourable members can imagine how I felt, having had a little to do with the film industry, not so much as a star but as a person who ran a theatre for some time. I really glowed with pride.

        I have a quick word now about two extremely important matters. I think the quicker the Government gets our domestic satellite up the better. Far too many people associated with strategic industries are scattered throughout the nation and have never seen even a test pattern; I imagine that many of then have never seen television. The satellite has to go up sooner or later. We can find money for lots of things; there are not so many millions involved. I think the whole thing should be accelerated not only to provide television for people who are scattered throughout the nation but also to provide defence, weather forecasts and communications. It would mean we would go into a completely new era. I appeal to the Government to try to isolate certain funds-surely it can be done-to provide a domestic satellite.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to roads. We are told that the Government is doing everything humanly possible, but the vote is not what it would be. Let me tell the House, as one who chairs a committee which watches local government throughout this country, that we will soon get to a situation in which roads will be crumbling. It will be not just a matter of building new roads but of maintaining what we have.

I am sure the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore), who is at the table, would agree with me that he and I can perhaps make the sacrifice, every time we drive to the Gold Coast, of paying a toll of 50c or $1. The Government would pick up millions of dollars and the toll would not affect one iota those people who pay it. Let us think in terms of putting a toll on the use of such roads or of some other means of raising the extra money required to sustain and maintain arterial roads which are there not for pleasure but to sustain the great industries of this country.

         —I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). It is not my intention tonight to engage the Government in a debate on economic policy. The Government's assessment of the performance of the economy in its Budget strategy has been very effectively criticised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and other speakers on this side of the House. I want to talk about some of the forgotten people, people who could have expected better from a Budget with a $1.5 billion surplus and who will be appallingly damaged by the Government's new and increased taxes on basic necessities and its failure to index fully taxable incomes. The Government's strategy is to hammer hard low and middle income earners in this Budget and offer them relief as an election approaches. The Government's eye is on the aggregated electoral behaviour in the future and not on what is happening to individuals now.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The swinging voter, this Government assumes, is somewhere around the median income range and, therefore, will be able to survive the depredations of the strategy with a little belt tightening and will respond favourably later on to permission to loosen that belt an inch or two in the Budgets of the next year or two. The problem is that the real life experience of Australians does not always conform to the aggregated average. Rising interest rates on housing loans catch individual families who may at this time be confronting educational expenses associated with children just commencing schooling, and new family expenses associated with sales tax on children's clothing. While some members of the community could absorb an additional $8 to $12 a week in mortgage rates and $5 a week in sales taxes, a large number of families on the margin will be pushed beyond their personal earning capacities and be forced, if they have mortgages over their houses, to become tenants in what was once their family home.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the families in this position the effect of the Budget will be catastrophic now and recovery will not be possible in a year or two when the Government is in a more generous mood. They may never again be able to borrow to buy a house, having defaulted on a mortgage once or having been compelled to sell on their own initiative. A loss of educational opportunities to a child who confronts these sorts of family circumstances and becomes worried as his family becomes depressed and quarrelsome with financial worries, may well experience permanent damage in his or her life chances no matter how much better conditions may become in the future. Any marriage guidance counsellor would be able to tell honourable members that problems in families are overwhelmingly related to the family's financial situation and not other problems of compatibility or whatever. Yet, unless the family has five or six children the increase in child endowment for the third child and beyond will not make up for these imposts. Furthermore, the larger the family the larger the house and hence possibly at least the mortgage. So advantages here can be wiped out as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the major group of forgotten people in this Budget are the pensioners. The oldest trick in the Australian politican's manual is called: 'Neglect the pensioners for two years and toss them a crumb or two when the election comes around'. The Whitlam Government indexed pensions to mitigate the worst excesses of this practice. However, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) attempted to make the best of a bad job in his Budget Speech when he announced the normal November pension rise-normal, that is, at least since the Whitlam Government introduced indexation of pensions-as though this were a generous Budget decision for which the pensioner ought to be extraordinarily grateful. His sleight of hand cannot conceal the paltry nature of actual Budget initiatives for pensioners and the quite menacing remarks made later in the evening on which the Budget was announced in another place by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) on pensioners' efforts to avoid earning income. I will deal with that matter a little later. All the Government has done is to make small additional grants to aged persons housing and minor adjustments in rental assistance. The Minister for Social Security, however, launched into an attack on pensioners' income avoidance with a vigour and vituperativeness that we on this side of the House use when we deal with the tax evasion industry. The Minister for Social Security had this to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        It has become evident that there is a growing practice of avoiding income for pension purposes, or even more commonly for pensioner fringe benefits. There is no essential difference, so far as the general community effect is concerned, between this and tax avoidance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The two are not to be equated. A professional person trying to reduce a tax liability on an income of over $50,000 a year is not to be equated with a pensioner trying to keep his or her nest egg within the limits of eligibility for fringe benefits. The point about the tax avoidance industry, against which this Government refuses to take decisive action, is that income actually received by the avoider goes untaxed because of some strategem on his part or on the part of his accountant. In the case of non-interest bearing deposits into which many pensioners put their savings to avoid difficulties with fringe benefits, no income is received by the pensioner. It is an entirely different situation. There are schemes which permit capital to accumulate without it being regarded as interest and, therefore, income for tax purposes. However, the vast bulk of pensioners using non-interest bearing deposits are not in these schemes and, therefore, lose money as the real value of their savings decline.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has already announced that it will deal with the scheme which permits increments to capital and that is an issue separate from the question of non-interest bearing deposits. However, the Minister for Social Security failed to limit his strictures to those schemes alone and has directly threatened to introduce a regulation, and if necessary legislation, to deal with the pensioners who are putting their funds into non-interest bearing deposits. If we are to believe the Minister, the pensioners are to be hit twice; once by the banks that are lending the money they receive from pensioners at normal rates, and once by the Government which is toying with the idea of a notional and taxable interest rate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look now at the situation of the pensioners, these people whom the Government equates with the worst rip-off merchants in our community. Let us see why they have to avoid income on savings from income on much of which they have already paid tax. I will use the example of a single pensioner today who is under 70 years of age. This year, the taxation threshold will be increased by only 3.8 per cent to $4,195. In the financial year ending 30 June 1980 a single pensioner could have had additional income of $18 a week to that of his pension before being taxed. This year it will be only $10. If this trend continues-I suggest that with the elimination of tax indexation it will continue-pensioners will soon be paying tax on their bare pension. The pensioners will also be in a difficult situation in that they will not be eligible for the health rebate as they pay no health insurance subscriptions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Pensioners who earn $20 a week above the pension, which is the maximum allowable income before deductions are made, will pay tax of $153.60 next year. If they earn $15 a week above the pension they will pay tax of $70 for the year. Income of $20 a week more than the pension loses half the value of the increase due to a deduction from the pension of $1 for every $2 earned.
       </para>
       <para>
        After tax is deducted the effective tax rate is 66c in the dollar. This is more than the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) pays on any of his earnings although the pensioner's income is still less than $100 a week. The pensioner loses fringe benefits with income of $40 more than the pension. Fringe benefits have always been important to the pensioner. Now, with the Government's scandalous new health scheme, the benefit is absolutely essential. That forty-first dollar will be taxed at 32c, 34c will be further cut from the pension and it will bring in bills of $8 per week as a result of the pensioner being moved off the health benefit. Is the Minister really surprised that pensioners will go to considerable lengths to avoid earning that extra dollar? The Minister for Social Security has offered the kindly suggestion to pensioners that they go on an overseas holiday or buy a car to use up the capital. The Government, in its ineffable generosity, will not take a jaundiced view of this.
       </para>
       <para>
        We face the interesting sight of age pensioners, compelled to sell the family home and to move into more appropriate accommodation, boarding planes in droves and circling the globe until their money runs out. Or perhaps to provide a facade for the Government's attempt to will prosperity on the people, pensioners will be encouraged to park a Rolls Royce outside their new flats. The sight of pensioners drag racing in Jaguars up the Great Eastern Highway in my electorate will no doubt be of some considerable comfort to the Minister. But how ridiculous it is! The Minister expects persons on $110 a week, who want to keep capital in case of emergencies for themselves or their families, to shift the fruits of their thrift from the banks to travel agents and car salesmen. The Government ought to be thanking its lucky stars that this piece of exploitation of the pensioners' economic situation has improved bank profitability and probably therefore, albeit in a minor way, has prevented interest rates rising even further. The obvious solution to this situation is for the allowable earnings limits to be greatly increased and then indexed for inflation as the basic pension is. This would have been achieved indirectly if the tax threshold had been raised to $4,529 as the Australian Labor Party advocated at the last election. It is time that we gave consideration to regarding the pensioner health benefit card as a retired persons' health benefit and at least indexing permissible earnings associated with it.

The pensioners in the electorate of St George have certainly been well served since the honourable member's timely re-election at the last election. Next year is the Year of the Aged. Therefore perhaps we can expect in the next Burget a more generous amelioration of the pensioners' condition, particularly as it will precede an election year. I am confident that pensioners will see through the short term nature of such commitments and will judge the Government on its parsimonious attitude of the last five years. I will get on to the Government's record in the International Year of Disabled Persons a little later. On the experience of the disabled I am not at all sure that the pensioners will experience the degree of generosity that they might expect in the International Year of the Aged.

        The Government has no understanding of the problems of families and the elderly. This Budget gives further indication of its disregard of the position of young Australians. The level of hopelessness among our young people cannot be underestimated. A recent survey of suicide statistics of young people under 24 years of age, which was conducted by Apex-not an extreme radical organisation-showed a doubling of the rates over the last 10 years. Since the Government's decision to abolish the Community Youth Support Scheme I have been inundated with correspondence from participants in CYSS programs and from service groups who support them. Universally these groups report bleak experiences for young people who have no alternative to them. They point to a reduction in crime and youth gang activity in areas where CYSS groups have opened. They offer me the very reasonable assumption that there will be an increase in anti-social activity with the closure of the various CYSS schemes. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) is proud of increased Government expenditure in various training schemes announced in the Budget. However, I wonder how seriously he has looked at some of the things he has done. For example, employers' subsidies paid for taking on and training young people have hitherto been conducted under the rubric of the National Employment and Training scheme and associated training schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the years Commonwealth Employment Service officers have been able to use the guidelines requiring a substantial component of training to discipline employers who might wish to abuse the scheme as a source of cheap labour. Employers who make a practice of sacking workers at the end of the training scheme can be eliminated from the program. However, in the Budget Papers, these schemes have now been shifted from NEAT to the more amorphous 'work experience' programs. My understanding is that CES officers have not yet been informed of the guidelines that apply here. Prima facie, however, the training aspect of the subsidy has been substantially reduced as a result of this decision. The idea that the employer should train a young person in a skill needed in the place of employment will be replaced by a lackadaisical assumption that any old work experience will do. So what if that person is laid off at the end of six months? At least, according to the Minister, they have had some sort of experience.
       </para>
       <para>
        I predict that abuse of the system will become rife, with several consequences. Firstly, there will be further disillusion for the young people affected. Secondly, there will be a spurious government conviction that substantial reductions will have occurred in the statistics of young unemployed. A further consequence will be abuse of the working capacities of many individual young people as employers seek to justify the non-retention of the young people put on under work experience. Last week I asked the Minister a question on this matter but he was unable to provide me with an answer. The Minister's department is in chaos. It becomes more chaotic with each promise he makes to wriggle out of the consequences of his stupid decision to close CYSS. This scheme is the only Government initiative in the youth employment area which came anywhere near to achieving its objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will comment on what is perhaps the most disappointing feature of the Budget, that is, its contribution to the needs of the disabled in our community. Much was expected of this International Year of the Disabled when the program was announced. This year's goal, we were told, was full participation in our society and equality of opportunity for disabled people.

         —That is right; so everybody can go to the wall. Some groups of disabled people had hoped for the introduction in this Budget of an attendant care allowance similar to those operating in Britain and the United States. Such a scheme has obvious advantages for both the disabled and the community at large. American programs have shown that many disabled people have been able to seek and find paid employment as a result of the freedom and independence that this allowance has given them. They have been able to gain the confidence to get out into the work force and to establish themselves as dignified human beings in their own right. That is a very basic objective with which all of us on both sides of the House would agree. Yet the Government is doing nothing to achieve it. In the long run, the taxpayers benefit from there being fewer people requiring invalid pensions and, more importantly, fewer people needing very expensive institutional care.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        A number of other allowances and aids have been sought by disabled groups in this year. None have been granted in this do-nothing Budget. All I hope is that before the end of the year additional expenditure is sought by the Government to make up for these very considerable inadequacies. This Budget surplus could well have been used to help the disabled and the unemployed, to increase fringe benefits for pensioners and to retain schemes which have been abolished. I support the additional amount of foreign aid appropriated in this Budget. However, I would like to make this point about the additional amount of some $100m. That is not our aid total; that is the addition to our aid in this Budget. Had the Government adopted a similar attitude in the areas that I have been talking about, that sum would have retained CYSS ten times over; or the Government could have retained CYSS five times over and introduced a wide variety of additional benefits for the disabled. These have never been assessed in any of the published statistics as being extraordinarily expensive to the community. It leaves me quite amazed that the Government has not come around to doing any thing serious about the disabled in this Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        I only say this to point out what a paltry sum in the overall Budget context this assistance would have cost. If the Government did not want to take money from the surplus, it might have taken it by improving the capacity of the taxation commissioners to investigate tax evasion. Yet here the Budget Papers show that the number of persons employed in the enforcement section of the Australian Taxation Office will be reduced by 179. How seriously is this Government committed to stamping out the tax avoidance industry? Not much when its activity in staffing the relevant office is considered. This Budget is ungenerous and it is uncaring. The cost of the Government's little games in attempting to set itself up with a bag of handouts in an election year will be carried by people whose lives may very well be ruined or, at least, very seriously damaged. The only consolation is that the cost eventually will be carried by the Ministers who produced it when in two years time they contemplate the future from the benches on which we are now sitting.

The honourable member for Swan will be supporting greater and bigger government, greater and bigger government intervention and the like. The points he made in relation to the effect that the Budget will have on individuals are largely valid. I will support a number of the aspects to which he has already referred.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I emphasise that I support the broad economic thrust of this Budget. It is a wise and economically responsible Budget. The record of the Government proves that its economic policies are proving well worth while. We have seen inflation brought under control and reduced. We have seen a rise in business confidence. We have seen a greater investment, both local and overseas, in industry and business. This is a reflection that the Government's policies have, indeed, been working. The consumer price index rose by only 8.8 per cent in the year to 30 June 1981. That is the best result for a number of years. We have seen better figures for employment both overall and for young people. We have seen a significant increase in real private business fixed investments of at least 22.5 per cent in real terms. We have seen strong expectations demonstrated in the capital inflow projected for 1981-82.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last year we saw an increase in average weekly earnings of some 14.1 per cent. It presents some real cause for concern, I think, when we see a forecast increase of some 13 per cent in average weekly earnings for this financial year. In considering the wage setting system I think we should be very concerned about increases in wages during the coming year. I think the situation can be best summed up from the 1980-81 report of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The Reserve Bank does not normally praise the Government or one take the Government line. It is a completely independent and professional body. Its views can be accepted reasonably well. In its report, it said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Activity rose strongly in the Australian economy during 1980-81. This contrasted with generally depressed economic conditions overseas. Following healthy increases in 1979-80, real non-farm product and total employment recorded their highest rates of growth for more than half a decade. The recovery was broadly-based with strong contributions from spending on both capital formation and consumption.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think this indicates that the direction of the Government's policy is correct. My comments will be concerned not with the direction of the Government's policy but with the strength and thrust of that policy. As a Liberal I strongly support a reduction in the government sector. I believe that the government sector is still much too large. I welcome the 350 decisions of the razor gang. These resulted in a decrease in expenditure of some $560m. But let us not place too much emphasis on the fact that the razor gang did its exercise. In effect, all it did represented a decrease of some 2 per cent in the annual outlays of the Commonwealth, which is a relatively small per cent. It does not even add up to 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the time there were a number of criticisms of the razor gang's exercise. I criticised it at the time. I maintained that the Review of Commonwealth Functions should be an ongoing policy and a requirement of each Minister within this Government. The very fact that one had to appoint a razor gang was a reflection on the ability of Ministers to control, prune and limit the activities and functions of their departments. I believe that a Minister should firmly monitor the activities and functions of departments and that the razor gang's activities should be a continuing function of any Minister and of any department. I contrast this with the activities in private enterprise. Firms do not have razor gang activities. They have constant reviews of the activities of each individual branch, and make constant adjustments and cut expenditure and wastage. That is exactly what the Commonwealth should still be doing. I have a firm belief the Commonwealth has not cut expenditure to anywhere near the required amount.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, I think the razor gang exercise was admirable in its concept. But overall, as I pointed out, the savings were small. In looking at the 350 recommendations of the razor gang we realise that a number of the recommendations were cosmetic and artificial and did not really contribute in any way to a reduction of government expenditure or a reduction of government staffing. I need only to refer to the recommendations concerning the Australian Wool Stores and the Australian Wool Testing Authority. I have spoken on these matters previously in this House. They were assets not held by the Commonwealth; they were not purchased by the Commonwealth; they were purchased by growers and financed by growers from their own charges. Apart from the fact that they were run by statutory authorities they were of no responsibility of or charge on the Parliament. The sale of those assets will in no way help the Commonwealth budgetary situation or lessen the impact of the Commonwealth Government's activities in the area of wool testing.
       </para>
       <para>
        It worries me even further that a number of the recommendations of the razor gang have been repudiated since and a number have not been yet implemented. Yesterday it was announced that a number of the recommendations of the razor gang in relation to the Australian Capital Territory had been repudiated or changed. I notice also that there has been no effort to form a joint committee as was proposed in the razor gang report. This was to be a committee set up to review the functions and the activities of statutory authorities. I believe that there is a large area that still has to be reviewed in that way. I call on the Government to take action immediately to appoint that joint committee, which I think could make a valuable contribution in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, as a Liberal, I am committed to a reduction in the size of the public sector, and so is the Government in many ways. Unfortunately, the actions of the Government have not matched its rhetoric. Let me go back to the Budget Speech of 1976-77. It was delivered by the current Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch). One statement that I appreciated and applauded in that Budget Speech was this:
       </para>
       <para>
        It will do so in part by putting an end to permissiveness in government spending and turning back the recent trend towards bigger and bigger government.
       </para>
       <para>
        They are great words. Unfortunately, as I said, our action has not matched our rhetoric. The rhetoric in that statement is absolutely in line with what I believe. In fact, Commonwealth Government Budget outlays in real terms have fallen only slightly during the term of this Government. They still represent 28 per cent of the gross domestic product. Total public sector expenditure is now some 38.1 per cent of gross domestic product. The fall has been reasonably insignificant in relation to both these figures. They have fallen from a peak in 1977-78 to the current levels, but the reduction has been quite slight. I believe there is a real need for this Government to honour its commitment to reduce the size of the Government sector. In fact, the growth rate for outlays in the public sector during past years has been faster than that for the economy overall. I acknowledge that in a number of areas, such as health, social security and education, there have been, in fact, expenditure increases above those which currently apply to total government expenditure.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to look at the Government's Budget aggregates. I want to look, firstly, at the receipt side. Last year we had a growth in Commonwealth receipts of some 18.6 per cent-a significant increase. No one could doubt that. We are projecting this year an increase in revenue of some 15.8 per cent. Part of this revenue will come from the implementation of changes in sales tax levies. Let me emphasise quite clearly that I believe there is no way in which a broadening of the tax base is not warranted. I can see good arguments indeed for a number of the sales tax increases. The implementation of the increase in sales tax on pet food could have been more gradual. I see no reason for such items which were exempt from sales tax previously being taxed at 17 1/2 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Overall I support the concept of a broadening of the tax base. I support that broadening on the basis that there are reductions in other areas of collection by the Commonwealth. I refer particularly to income tax. I think there is justification for the increase in sales tax only if this increase can be offset by a reduction in income tax. I am disappointed that that has not happened. Our rhetoric over a number of years has been that income taxes have to be reduced. I believe-some Opposition members may believe that I have been convinced of this by our propaganda-that income taxes have to be reduced substantially. I note that this year income tax collections will rise by some 19 per cent-by almost the same amount by which they have risen in the past 10 years. Income tax collections represent over 50 per cent of the total tax collections of the Commonwealth. This is much too high a level. I think if we look at the forecast for wages-an increase of some 13 per cent in average weekly earnings for this financial year that I referred to earlier-we will see that pay-as-you-earn tax contributions will rise by some 22 per cent. The Commonwealth is gaining in this way. I object to this in many ways. I believe that there is ample room for a reduction in government expenditure and substantially reduced income tax levies. I am critical also of the Commonwealth's outlays. Direct government outlays by the Commonwealth this year will rise by some 15.1 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am critical also of the concept of federalism. I think this Government had a good federalism policy, one that could have matured and developed in many ways. Unfortunately, we have seen cuts in the amounts made available to the States. This year we will see a reduction in payments to the States from 8.2 per cent when compared with last year's figure. Yet Commonwealth Government outlays are rising by 15.1 per cent. The point I make is that if we try to impose restrictions on the States we should impose similar restrictions on ourselves. We are not doing that. As a Liberal I am committed to the transfer to the State governments of a number of functions currently carried out by the Commonwealth Government. I believe that transfer can take place only with an adequate transfer of the means to perform those functions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite frankly, I am appalled at the legislation that has been introduced recently in relation to education funding providing for the transfer of capital funds to recurrent expenditure. I feel that this is not at all in the spirit of federalism, or the federalism that I espoused in the early days. I believe in a number of areas where Commonwealth funding is involved, such as education and roads, there can well be a relaxation of the Connowealth's control. Let the State governments which are in a position to make decisions make those decisions and bear the penalties if their decisions are not right in relation to the disbursal of funds. I note also that the tightening of State finances inevitably will result in an increase in State government taxes and charges. I note also that many of these charges are very regressive indeed. I think by their very nature thay are regressive. This places a greater burden on the family man and the single man.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, I must refer in some degree to some of the statements made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Swan. I comment on some aspects of social security and the adjustmjents made in this Budget. It is my belief that it is a requirement of government to service those who are most needy, those who are most deserving of social security benefits. We see two types of social security benefits: We see those which are designed either by way of a means test or some other device to apply to the needy and those which are applied generally. Quite frankly, I criticise this Budget for its decision in relation to the changes in the family allowance. I do not see it as fair or reasonable that families consisting of three, four or more children should be the ones who are the recipients of increased benefits. In my view this is a very rough and inaccurate guide as to need. I can think of many cases where the need may be much greater; for example, where supporting mothers, the unemployed, those who are receiving sickness benefits and other social security recipients have one or two children. I criticise very much the fact that we as a government have lost the opportunity to reverse the trend towards universal application of social security benefits. This is a perfect case where some type of means test could have been applied. The increased allowance should have been given to those in need, not to those who fell into a broadly based category.

        I join the honourable member for Swan in criticising the statements by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) that the capital of pensioners should be included in the determination of their pension entitlements. I look back at the 1976-77 Budget speech. I do not have time to quote from that Speech. I was convinced that what we said in that Speech represented a fair change from the previous arrangement under which a notional capital return was means tested in determining eligibility for a pension. I definitely disassociate myself from statements by the Minister for Social Security that people who invest money so that they receive low or nil returns are in the same position as tax dodgers. I emphasise that I completely disassociate myself from those statements by the Minister. In fact, what pensioners are doing at the moment is exactly what we endorsed in 1976 when we changed the requirements and qualifications for receiving aged pension. In fact, I support some degree of justification on a needs assessment basis before a person can receive social security benefits.

        It seems to me that we have our priorities completely wrong. In no way can I reconcile the decisions made in relation to family allowances, on the one hand, and pensions on the other. It seems to me that the ideal item in which to apply the idea of a means test is the family allowances area. If I had a preference, I certainly would have applied means testing in that area rather than applying it in the pension area. There are a number of areas in which I have criticised the Government--

         —I am delighted that my good friend and colleague the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey) has been struck by a blinding flash of light. He can now see the difference between the Fraser Government's promises and its performance, and he mentioned taxation particularly. Wage and salary earners of Australia are now suffering record tax. In fact, the wage and salary earners of Australia are being taxed more now than ever before. In addition to the taxation payments, under the latest Fraser medi-muddle every Australian family has to find an additional $10 to $18 a week for payments to medicare funds. So in addition to the record taxation to which the honourable member for Canning alluded, every Australian family is further taxed under the Fraser Government's scheme for medical care.

        Tonight we are at somewhat of a disadvantage in this debate if we are seeking to embark on an informed discussion of defence issues. Last year the defence report was brought down on 19 August 1980, well before this time, and yet we have not received the defence report for 1981. Also about this time last year the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) made a detailed statement on defence, but we have not yet seen one this year. I think it is important to recognise that last year was an election year. As we all know, nothing concentrates the mind of the Liberal Party on defence so much as an upcoming election. We all know that the Minister for Defence is renowned for the eloquence of his rhetoric but not for the accuracy of his statements or his forecasts, and I will give an example. In his statement of 29 March 1979, and this was in the period of the Afghanistan euphoria, the Minister asserted:
       </para>
       <para>
        The provision in 1978-79 for a defence outlay larger in real terms than any achieved since the last Budget of the McMahon Government;
       </para>
       <para>
        Leaving aside the fact that Australia was still engaged in the operations of war at the time of the last McMahon Government, let us look at the record of the Government's defence report. I have alluded to the defence report for 1980, and I invite honourable members to glance at page 50. In 1978-79, the year the Minister was talking about, the defence expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product was 2.6 per cent. If we look back to the last Labor defence Budget, the ratio was in fact 2.7 per cent. In real terms, the Minister's promise to have a larger outlay than at any time previously was ostensibly false. In 1978-79 the ratio fell to 2.6 per cent. In more recent times the Government has made equally inaccurate and misleading statements, and I refer honourable members to the 1980-81 Budget Paper No. 1. If they look at page 70 they will note that the Government promised that defence outlays in 1980-81 would represent a real increase of 'at least 7 per cent over defence outlays in 1979-80'. Let us look at the record. The increase in actual outlay was not at least 7 per cent, as the Government had indicated, but in fact was 4.2 per cent. In the same document the Government stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The financial guidance for Defence planning purposes provides for an average annual increase in defence outlays of about 7 per cent-
       </para>
       <para>
        We get that 7 per cent back again--
       </para>
       <para>
        in real terms during the current five-year program, 1980-81 to 1984-85.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government further stated that its aim was to bring defence expenditure to 3 per cent of gross domestic product. The Government must have forgotten that promise because if honourable members look at Budget Paper No. 1 for 1981-82 they will find the disclosure that the 1981-82 Estimates involve 'a real increase over 1980-81 of about 5.3 per cent'. So here is a forecast for one year of 7 per cent relating to a particular year and that particular year does not measure up to the promise made. The promise was 7 per cent and the Government finished up with 5.3 per cent. The same document also informs us that for 1980-81 Budget outlays were 2.7 per cent of gross domestic product. This makes a complete nonsense of the Government's repeated assertions that defence spending is well up. In six years of greater attention to propaganda and promises than to performance, the Government has managed to increase defence outlays from the Labor Government's figure of 2.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent of gross domestic product. So much for the hollow claims and empty rhetoric of this Government on defence matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        Talking about hollow claims and empty rhetoric, another area of Government activity to which I would like to refer is the area of foreign aid. We all know that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is preparing himself for his entry onto the international stage at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne. He has discovered the North-South dialogue and is parading as the champion of the less developed countries. Again, let us look at the record. Some years ago the United Nations set a target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official aid. Referring to the official documentation of this Budget, if one looks at page 14 of Budget Paper No. 8, the hypocrisy of the Government on the question of foreign aid is plain for everyone to see. In 1975, the last year of the Labor Government, the Whitlam Government, Australia's aid reached 0.65 per cent of gross national product. That was very close to the 0.7 per cent that had been set as a target by the United Nations. Five years later, and five years of Fraser Government, the figure has dropped sharply. It has dropped from 0.65 per cent to 0.48 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last evening the Estimates Committee passed a resolution that the Government should accept the 0.7 per cent target. The Fraser Government has never made a statement since it has been in government that the 0.7 per cent target set by the United Nations should be an accepted target of the Government. In the Estimates debates last night the Minister suggested that the expenditure this year, 1981-82, would show very little increase in real terms over the expenditure last year. So instead of perhaps 0.48 per cent, by a massive effort-surprise, surprise-it might get it up to 0.49 per cent or perhaps even 0.5 per cent. The resolution passed last night put it on the Government to make a statement that it was prepared not only to accept the target of 0.7 per cent but also to work conscientiously towards that target. We only hope that it will take the recommendation to heart.
       </para>

        This Government's record of assistance to the disadvantaged is as deplorable internationally as it is domestically. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) gave a catalogue of this Government's policies in relation to the disadvantaged within the Australian society. It is a deplorable record of inadequacy, incompetence and absence of any feeling for the disadvantaged, including Aborigines, the handicapped and the senior citizens of this country. The same thing applies to the Fraser Government internationally, as we have noticed in the statistics of its aid effort. These statistics are stated very clearly in the Budget Papers that this Government has presented. I am sure that the performance of the Prime Minister, as distinct from his rhetoric and promise, will not go unnoticed at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.
       </para>
       <para>
        While we are on the subject of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, it is not too late for the Prime Minister to heed the parting advice of the outgoing President of the United Nations General Assembly. He recently criticised the massive indulgence of the international cocktail circuit. One is almost inclined to call it not only a circuit but also a circus. He pointed out that one national cocktail party at the United Nations General Assembly could fund a health care unit in a less developed country for over a year. This Government will spend $12m of Australian taxpayers' funds on administrative arrangements and entertainment, not only on the meeting in Melbourne but also on what is called the retreat in Canberra. It is not only a scandal, but also a disgrace. If the Prime Minister were less concerned about strutting the world stage and more concerned, as he professes he is, for the disadvantaged, he would divert a substantial part of that $12m to assist the people of the countries the visiting heads of government represent. I leave that thought with the Prime Minister.

        I now turn to a subject that is very close to my heart and to people in the electorate of St George. I notice that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) is at the table. I refer to aircraft noise. I have been associated with this matter as the honourable member for St George off and on for the last 10 years. I had the privilege of serving on the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise over 10 years ago. That Committee made a series of recommendations for minimising aircraft noise, not only at Sydney Airport but also at other airports throughout Australia. One of those recommendations was the strict enforcement of the curfew. When the Labor Government came to power in 1972-

         —I do detect the difference. When we came to office in 1972 we certainly had the power to enforce the curfew. That curfew was strictly maintained from 1972 to 1975. We are now fighting a losing battle. In 1976 the number of flights during curfew hours-I am indebted to the Minister for Transport for providing these figures-was 3,562. In 1980 that figure had jumped by 82 per cent to 6,480. In addition, jets-admittedly quiet ones but jets nevertheless-have been allowed to operate at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport during the curfew hours. To my mind, to the people who live in the electorates of St George, Barton and Grayndler this is the thin edge of the wedge.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is also a further disturbing trend, that is the increase in traffic in the late evenings between 10 p.m. and 6.45 a.m. These figures include traffic during the curfew hours: In 1976 flights between 10 p.m. and 6.45 a.m. numbered 8,463. By 1980 there have been a 67 per cent increase to 14,096. That increase of 67 per cent can be related to an 18.6 per cent increase in general traffic. There is now a concentration of traffic in the period 10 p.m. to 6.45 a.m. I do not think that the Minister at the table was the Minister for Transport in 1979 but at that stage the Government quite secretly introduced a reduction of the curfew to midnight. This meant that planes could land at Kingsford-Smith Airport without approval to 12 o'clock instead of the curfew hour of 11 o'clock. It was only through community opposition that that secret move was overcome.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the member for St George I am concerned about the 24-hour a day traffic either landing or taking off over the electorate. Since 1976 there has been a 32 per cent increase in traffic over St George. In 1976 there were 29,072 movements over the St George area. In 1980 there were 38,477. This means that the more traffic that comes to Kingsford-Smith Airport the more the people of St George will have to suffer. The Fraser Government-I think this was confirmed this afternoon by the Minister at the Estimates committee hearing on the Department of Transport appropriations-intends to increase the traffic at Kingsford-Smith Airport to 280,000 movements a year. At present there are 182,000 movements. That means there will be a 50 per cent increase in the amount of traffic at Kingsford-Smith Airport. I say to the Minister for Transport that that is not on. It is always said: 'Things will not be so bad because we will have new technology aircraft. They will be quieter'. That is humbug. Trans Australian Airlines has bought the Airbus and I accept that it is quieter but the opposition, the Murdoch-Ansett airline, has purchased an increased number of Boeing 727s and 737s. Those planes are equipped with Pratt and Whitney engines which came into service in the United States in 1963. We are not talking about new planes, we are talking about old technology. These aircraft with their 18-year-old design Pratt and Whitney engines are being brought into service as new aircraft. We will have them for another 10 to 15 years at least. Any proposition that the so-called new aircraft will lead to quieter Kingsford-Smith Airport is sheer humbug.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have been fighting for some time for a second airport for Sydney. The second runway-I make this very clear to the Minister for Transport-makes no sense technically or financially. Technically, in order to have simultaneous operations at an airport with dual runways, under International Civil Aviation Organisation regulations there should be a separation between runways of 1,300 metres or 4,300 feet. The Government's recommendation is for close parallel runways separated by 335 metres or 1,100 feet. There are some arguments about how much the second runway will cost. The figures run from $395m to $600m. But let me point out that the cost of a new airport would be in the vicinity of $675m. The lesson is very clear: Let us not take two bites of the cherry; let us not build a second runway and then go and build a second airport. The decision, to my mind, is very clear: Let us get on and build a second airport so that the people of the St George area will not for life ever more have to suffer the difficulties, the strains of aircraft noise, that they have suffered over the last few years. The decision should be made now. The Minister says that the Commonwealth has the authority. Let it use that authority.

I feel that it has been shown to be a successful policy basically because of its capacity to contain and to reduce the rate of inflation in Australia today. Inflation has a direct effect on every person's pocket. When a housewife or any other person in Australia today goes into a shop to purchase an item or goes to some business establishment to receive a service, he or she benefits from a contained inflation rate. Inflation has a direct effect on the money in one's pocket. I think the Government has been more than successful in world terms in this particular field. It is a tough policy in many ways.

         —I will come to that in a little while. However, I feel that in the main the Government has been hard to be kind. The Budget had helped to shift the balance of tax from income tax to indirect tax. One could argue at length in the electorate or in the Parliament about the virtues of direct or indirect tax. Income tax is a disincentive in many ways for productivity. Right throughout Australia today there are people who do not want to be more productive because the income tax they would have to pay on the extra money they earned would not make it worth their effort. Therefore, I feel that income tax is self-destructive in many ways. I do not advocate the complete abolition of income tax and a move across to indirect tax; however, I feel that there should be a better balance. I am afraid that I do not quite agree with the Government's approach in that a little time ago it looked at indirect tax and then backed off and said: 'No, we will not bring in another form of indirect tax'. I have always felt that we should have moved into the indirect tax field at that stage. However, that is history.

In the field of social security, which of course received the largest slice of our Budget we talk about a 14.7 per cent rise or a total of $9.865m. I have some very strong personal feelings about the pension system. I am convinced that unfortunately there are many people throughout our society today who do not really need the pension they are getting. I feel that there are many people taking advantage of the system when they are not truly in need. When I was a lad and all through my early life I was led to believe that pensions were to be made available to those who were in need, whether through bad luck, bad health or some other incapacity. Pensions were to be provided to look after the needy. Unfortunately, I find as I move thoughout society today that there is this general thought: A pension is my just and deserved right; as a taxpayer all my life it is time I started to get something back. This might be all very well if we were talking about a national superannuation scheme but we are talking about a pension scheme funded by the taxpayer. When I speak to a lot of the younger taxpayers today, it surprises me to hear them say: 'Yes, I agree that so-and-so could well afford to do without the pension; however, he has paid his taxes all his life and surely he is justly entitled to it'. I am sorry but I am afraid that I do not agree with that concept. I feel that taxes in this particular field should not go to other than the truly needy.

I feel that none of us would be in this Parliament or in the surrounds of this Parliament had it not been for the veterans of Australia, the men and women who were caught up in those horrible wars-whichever one one would like to think of; there was a whole series of them. As I say, I have a very soft spot for these veterans. I am pleased to see that there have been some improvements in benefits for veterans. I feel that this is one area in which the Government can show even more compassion. In the field of health, we see a complete change in the Government's policy. I personally like the scheme except for one particular area and that is the cut-off point between the disadvantaged person and the person who is outside government support. I feel that the Government could well have had a graduated carry-over system beyond the $96 per week for a single person without children or the $160 per week for the married couple. I feel that the cut-off point is just too sharp and it certainly has created a great deal of antagonism throughout Australia.

       <para>
        There is one small area of concern in the health program that I have struck and it concerns the large number of people who are involved in casual employment. These people are very worried about whether they will be within the disadvantaged person category this week and outside it the next. I am assured by the Department of Social Security that it does an average over four weeks and that it will be sympathetic to every case. I hope this is so because there are a large number of people throughout Australia today who are relying on casual work to be workers; who are not prepared to go on unemployment relief and who will keep battling for the job. Some weeks they will be in luck, some weeks they will not. I instance the case of Awol Meats Pty Ltd in my electorate which has had to close down. I know there are men at that works who are battling to get casual work.

        I have been particularly interested in the International Year of Disabled Persons program. Unfortunately, we have only $2.43m available out of the Budget for this program. It is an ambitious program which, in my opinion, has not really got off the ground. I might be open to criticism. It may have got off the ground in certain areas but not, I feel, in the country areas, and particularly the country areas that I represent. The program includes a whole series of things: The modification of homes, the provision of wheelchairs, the provision of such things as oxygen equipment, wigs, mammary prostheses, electrolarynxes, aids for incontinence, walking aids and a whole series of equipment for disabled people, such as crockery, cutlery, cooking utensils and toilets.

         —Maybe one day the honourable member will take advantage of this program, and maybe it will not be too far away. However, I feel that carrying the program on for only 12 months is not long enough. There was the International Year of the Child and now the International Year of Disabled Persons. One year really is not long enough for a program-even though it is world wide-to get rolling. It should be ongoing, and certainly it should have a two-year impact period and then a rolling continuation.

        I now refer to the subject of employment, and youth affairs in particular. I have been very interested in the Community Youth Support Scheme projects in my electorate. In a rural electorate, those projects have been a rip-roaring success. However, on 31 October they are to be closed. I am most disappointed. I am the first to admit that they might not have been the complete answer and they might not have been as successful in many areas as one would have hoped. However, they were a start. They were a community effort. Participating citizens all made a contribution. However, the scheme is to be terminated on 31 October and it appears that we will not change our minds in that regard.

        I admire the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown). I think he is doing a very good job in very difficult circumstances. I hope that he pursues the line that he has pronounced several times recently and will look at the problem of the young person who will not fit into the quite extensive training for the work force schemes that are being made available by the Government. There is certainly an element of young people who are not able to take advantage of those schemes. I wish to comment on just one of those training schemes, and that is SYETP, the Special Youth Employment Training Program. Unfortunately, some employers are taking advantage of that scheme as a way of subsidising their work force. I condemn that. Some employers have employed a young person for 17 weeks at a subsidies rate of $55 per week and have then sacked them.

        More than $302m will be provided by the Commonwealth this year for the construction and maintenance of national highways and the development of roads throughout Australia. In Victoria, out of a total $52.87m for national highways, more than $23m will be provided for work on the Hume Highway, including major expenditure on the Seymour-Avenel by-pass, and about $6m on the Wallace-Bungaree by-pass on the Western Highway, and some $9m on a by-pass and duplicate projects on the Princes Highway between Dandenong and Traralgon. All these highways are vitally important for Victoria. However, throughout our nation there is a series of arterial roads and local roads that, whilst receiving funding, are not receiving enough funding in many cases even to maintain them, let alone improve them for the modern motor car. This, I feel, is an area in which government will have to be very cautious and make sure that funding is provided certainly to maintain them at a high standard, if not improve it.

        I shall make just a brief comment on housing. I thought the answer given by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) this morning in answer to a question regarding an analysis of housing in Australia by the Reserve Bank of Australia research department was most significant. I think there was one paragraph in an article from the Department of Housing and Construction 'News Summary' which the Treasurer did not enunciate and which I should. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the level of home ownership in Australia remains at probably the highest in the western world and has actually picked up since the mid-1970s-
       </para>
       <para>
        That is very significant. Since 1975 it has picked up. The article further states:
       </para>
       <para>
        and is again close to an all-time peak. Further, more than one-third of Australian households fully-own their homes . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that is significant. I do not think there is much more I should say about housing. Naturally, we would like to be able to provide more funds for welfare housing. The cake has to be shared right across the board. Naturally, if one's interest is in one sector one can make a lot of noise about that sector. That is being done in regard to welfare housing.

        I refer now to education. Certain allowances have been made for isolated students. The Secondary Allowances Scheme will increase from 10 per cent from $660 to $726 a year the special supplementary allowance under the Isolated Children's Assistance Scheme. Under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme the level of family income for eligibility for maximum benefit will be increased from $10,312 to $11,334 a year. It may not sound a lot but it will be very significant to a large number of parents.

        In primary industry it is very significant that we appear to be making further progress in the beef classification system, and $1.1m will be made available for that. I hope that we can make some real progress in this program, which has been dragging its feet. The other area I mention is meat inspection. I am sure the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) will be looking closely-he has assured us that he is-at the duplication of meat inspection.

        Finally, I would like to touch rapidly on energy and research and to point out the funds committed over a period for technology.

This is an area about which I am often asked whether we are doing any work. I assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Government is. The only other thing I would like to refer to is liquefied petroleum gas which, as an alternative fuel, would be a major area of attention by the Government. We intend to convert 9,000 Commonwealth vehicles over the next three years. Three thousand of those will be vehicles of Commonwealth Government Departments and 6,000 will be vehicles of self-financing government instrumentalities. This has to be a positive step forward.

         —The Budget, as a financial planning document embodying the social and economic concepts of this Government, does not, in the view of the Opposition, meet the needs of the Australian people. As an economic document it represents the worst aspects of the monetarist doctrine so dearly beloved of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). It perpetuates and endeavours to sustain a series of economic myths that have been perpetrated by this Government over the years. As a social document it is a disaster. It compounds the social inequality in our community. It imposes heavier burdens on those sections of our community who are least able to bear them. It entrenches social class division within Australian society and it compounds many of the divisions already existing at other levels of our community.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Let me deal first with it as an economic document. It should not be forgotten by this Parliament that this Prime Minister has been in power longer than any Prime Minister in our history since the late Sir Robert Gordon Menzies-longer than Gorton, longer than McMahon and longer than Whitlam. This Prime Minister has had all the time that any government could reasonably expect to secure the basic aspects of his economic policies. The main thrust of this economic doctrine has been to control inflation. How real is that promise? How real is that objective in terms of this Budget? In 1975-76 inflation was 13 per cent. In 1980-81 it was reduced to 9.4 per cent. On the Budget indicators within this document it is conceded by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) that in the financial year 1981-82 the present Budget estimate is an inflation figure of 11 per cent. If one looks at that economic objective of the Prime Minister in terms of the time span he has had to control inflation, on the standards of his own Budget that objective has not been obtained.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another major problem that confronts this community and haunts this Government is the problem of unemployment. Employment growth, as projected in this Budget, is likely to be 2 per cent or less. With an annual growth in the work force in excess of 2 per cent, it has to be conceded by the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and all save the most politically jaundiced that this Budget will not solve the problems of unemployment in this community. I remind the House and the people of Australia that the Prime Minister, who was going to turn the lights on, after a record period in government now presides over the highest unemployment level in our history. Of course, this was the Prime Minister, this was the government, that was pledged to lift the burden of taxation from the shoulders of the Australian people. It was a simple economic doctrine: He would take from the public sector, he would transfer to the private sector; smaller government meant smaller taxation. It would have been an appropriate doctrine with which to write a story like Alice in Wonderland, and one begins to wonder whether this Government and this Treasurer do not permanently live in a wonderland surrounded by economic advisers who only sustain their somewhat mystical economic doctrines.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the reality of this Budget document: No member on the Government side of the House-not the Treasurer, not the Prime Minister-can deny that one of the results of this Budget is to take taxation to the highest ever level as a percentage of gross domestic product, especially for pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. It will be still higher in the current financial year. Increased tax burdens are now the lot of wage and salary earners. Neither the Treasurer nor any member of this House can deny that, although tax has become an increasing burden on wage and salary earners, the tax evasion industry in Australia under this Prime Minister has been one of the few industries that could truly be described as a growth industry. For the very rich in Australian society it is no longer a question of what level of tax they pay. They go along to an eminent lawyer, they get into a whole range of agreements with accountants and they do not pay any tax at all. Is anything to be done about that in this Budget? No, the Budget indicates that that sort of financial rip-off will continue at approximately the same level.
       </para>
       <para>
        How does the Treasurer, how does any honourable member opposite, reconcile the introduction of a broadly based sales tax which will affect the living standards of every family in Australian society-the kid who buys a can of dog meat for his pet dog will find himself confronted with the greedy hands of the Treasurer of this Government-with the Prime Minister's pledge in 1975, on behalf of every honourable member opposite, to end taxation by stealth. The Government said not a word about sales tax increases prior to the 1980 election. In November last year the Prime Minister went on record and rejected as idle and false rumour, as untrue Labor propaganda, the very suggestion that he or his Goverment was planning to introduce a value added tax or any similar broad-based tax. I would like to hear from any of the honourable gentlemen opposite how they now justify the promises freely made by them to the Australian people in 1980 in terms of this Budget doctrine.
       </para>
       <para>
        My colleagues earlier in this debate described in detail the doubling of sales tax on furniture, floor coverings, white goods and bedding. They illustrated the tax impost on clothing, shoes, books and newspapers, the tax increase on cars-the tax on every level of consumption by the average Australian family. At the end of six years of Fraser tax policy 98 per cent of taxpayers are paying a higher proportion of their incomes in tax than they were during the last year of the Whitlam Government. The average Australian family is now more highly taxed than at any time in our history. Since this Government came to office pay-as-you-earn tax collections have risen by 144 per cent, compared with a growth in total wages and salaries paid of 98 per cent. One can add to this burden the costs that come from increased charges under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, increased health insurance charges under the fifth Fraser health scheme, increased interest charges on home loans and increased education charges. People in my State, Victoria, can add the very significant increases imposed by the State Liberal Government under a Premier who was once-I doubt whether he is any longer-an enthusiastic exponent of Fraser federalism. There were very substantial increases in gas and electricity charges in Victoria.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the light of all those increases in tax and in charges and in the light of the evidence I gave to the House, which showed that tax collections had risen by 144 per cent but real wages and salaries paid had only grown by 98 per cent, it is not possible for anyone to argue seriously in this Parliament or anywhere else that Fraser federalism and Fraser monetarist policies have not severely eroded the living standards of every Australian family. Do the practical men opposite-there are a few-or anybody else believe that when confronted with reduced living standards white collar workers and blue collar workers at every level of our society, locked in as many of them are to a scale of minimum payments, can avoid them? If one is paying for a house and one is caught with increased interest charges there is no way in which one can avoid them. If one is caught in a range of payments for hire purchase goods there is no way that one can avoid them. If one is educating two or three children who need clothing, feeding and all of the things that go with sending children to school, there is no way of avoiding those costs. If any of those children are sick and one is caught with doctors' and health care bills there is no way of avoiding those payments. It is not easy for the Australian citizen to tighten his belt.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose one can forgive the Prime Minister, the squatter from Nareen, for not really being able to comprehend that problem. He has never had to experience it. Does anybody seriously believe that in this situation wage and salary earners at every level will not seek increases in their wages and salaries in order simply to maintain their existing living standards? Of course they will. Of course they will rely on their trade union organisations to maintain those standards. So within this Budget there is a formula that will inevitably lead to industrial confrontation, strikes and further occasions when Ministers opposite will say what a monstrous and terrible thing it is for the average Australian wage and salary earner to try, by industrial action, to maintain his living standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps these taxation increases could have been justified if there were a corresponding increase in the standards of public service, that should be being provided in this community, or an increase in assistance to the largest number of Australians in our history who are living below the poverty line. Who could seriously complain if there were a significant increase for pensioners in this Budget? For single pensioners the proportion of average weekly earnings represented by the pension will fall to 22 per cent this year as compared with 23 per cent last year and 25 per cent under the Whitlam Government.

Who would seriously argue in terms of the priorities of this Government? If one were to be candid with the Australian people one would say: 'Of course it is a proper, honourable and decent thing to maintain those projects'. If given a real choice as to whether to maintain those projects or to put up with the Prime Minister hawking himself around Melbourne posing as a great international statesman and spending upwards of $14m on the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, who amongst the Australian people would not say: 'It might be perfectly proper to host CHOGM but do you have to do it at such a cost?

        It is a question of what are the social priorities of this Government at a time when we have record unemployment of young Australians. Teenage unemployment rose from 91,000 to 131,000 in the five years to 1980. At a time when government should be expanding its role in education, confronted with the enormity of those figures, given the tasks of transition education, the need to educate young people for technological change, to deal with the problems of migrant and special education and adult retraining programs, education at every level in Australian society except in the private school system so dearly beloved amongst the old boys who sit on ministerial benches, is being attacked. Funding to colleges of advanced education has been cut by 11.7 per cent in real terms. The number of Victorian teacher trainees will be cut to half what it was when the Fraser Government took office. More and more parents are being forced out of the State education system to pay for a private education in order to provide their children with equal educational opportunities.
       </para>
       <para>
        At every level Australians are paying more in tax but getting less back in public service. The rhetoric of diminishing the public sector for the private sector is economic nonsense. What is occuring in Australia is that the control of our economic destiny is not being transferred from the public sector to the private sector, which has some degree of responsibility to the Australian elector, to transnational corporations. I do not cavil with any argument that says that there ought to be a reduction in the level of Australian bureaucracy but I would prefer an Australian bureaucrat any day of the week to a nameless, faceless, company director sitting in London, Detroit or Tokyo who is able to control the economic destiny of this nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Canada is the country most penetrated by transnational corporations but Australia, under the Fraser Government, has the dubious reputation of being second. About 40 per cent of all the large companies and their assets in Australia are foreign controlled and in some key sectors of the economy that figure is 100 per cent. Conservatively, 40 to 50 per cent of the Australian corporate economy is now under the control of transnational corporations. The capacity of this Government in its attacks upon its public sector to deal with that problem to see that Australians have some say and some control over their economic future, is being increasingly diminished.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Budget will increase inflation not reduce it. It will increase unemployment not reduce it. It will compound social inequality already existing in Australian society. It will reduce equal educational opportunity for the great majority of Australian children. It will impose the highest tax burdens on wage and salary earners in our history and in reducing their living standards it will produce industrial confrontation as wage and salary earners struggle and strive to maintain those standards. It will leave the tax evasion industry and its rich clientele comparatively unscathed. It will continue to attack and diminish, at every level, public services that ought to be a necessary and vital part of the functioning of any democracy. It is a wretched Budget, a dishonest Budget and a Budget lacking in compassion and imagination. It is a tribute to a Treasurer who does not know and a Prime Minister who does not care.

         —I speak in support of the Budget and its general priority of economic restraint. Obviously there are parts of it which I am not so happy to support. These refer to tax, the Community Youth Support Scheme, roads and Telecom Australia. But I also want to refer to what I consider to be an interesting initiative in the Budget and that is the establishment of an Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Firstly, I will refer to tax. It must be acknowledged that there is an increase in tax in this Budget when one considers sales tax, income tax and fiscal drag. Therefore it is important that the promised personal income tax relief, as the offset for the sales tax increases, comes quickly. To me a good starting point would be to lift the tax thresholds for the different levels of income tax, particularly the initial threshold which determines when a person commences paying tax. This would help all taxpayers but assist particularly low income groups and pensioners who earn additional income. The latter reason is important not only in itself but because it is a necessary prerequisite for updating the $20 permissible earnings. That figure has not been altered since 1972. But if one increases the permissible earnings limit without altering the tax threshold it would add insult to injury to the pensioners of Australia because all of them would automatically be liable for taxation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second grouch that I have relates to the decision to end the Community Youth Support Scheme. I think it is a particularly sad decision for rural and regional areas where the scheme has been the most successful. Nine of these groups are in the Murray electorate. I think it has the most of any electorate in Australia. I believe there are three reasons why CYSS should continue. The first is that the group that is assisted by the Community Youth Support Scheme consists of young unemployed who are below the training program level. The expansion of training programs-which is one of the features of this Budget-will not really help this group of young people. To my mind, $14m out of a total Budget allocation of over $200m for young persons training programs is not an untoward expenditure. The second point I want to make in support of CYSS is that it has allowed small communities to participate and that is very rare for a government program. Most government programs require the structures, technical colleges and so forth of larger cities. The third point is that it has provided an equally rare opportunity for the communities to become involved. One of the features of the success in country areas has been the way in which the communities have become involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to commend the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) for the way in which he has gone around and met many CYSS groups and discussed the Government's decision with them. As soon as the Commonwealth Employment Service interviews with the CYSS groups are concluded and the ideas are collated I urge the Minister to make a statement which will provide additional flexible criteria to the already extended and enlarged training programs to allow at least some CYSS type or CYSS related schemes to continue in these small rural and regional areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        My next complaint concerns roads. There is a declining federal government allocation for roads. The 9 per cent increase for this year is less than the 11 per cent increase for last year and it will be followed by an even smaller amount-as promised at this stage-of 7 per cent next year. The 9 per cent increase for this year will not be as high as the projected inflation rate as indicated in the Budget Papers, and is far below what is considered to be the road construction and maintenance rate of about 16 per cent. I believe that for 1982-83 the 7 per cent increase in federal government funds that is promised at the moment will have to be doubled to provide an adequate amount for the road system of this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The record of the States is even worse. This morning in answer to a question the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) referred to Victoria as being one of the better-off States. I point out to him that last year Victoria matched the amount of money provided for roads with that of the Commonwealth-as it had to under the roads agreement at that time-but this year it has reduced its increase in expenditure to under 5 per cent. Last night's Victorian Budget, which increased petrol and diesel taxes, may allow the Victorian Government to provide more money for it. But the roads in my electorate are visibly deteriorating. There is no sealing program for local roads and resurfacing of existing sealed roads is falling behind. More money is desperately needed, particularly for local roads. The local road system is the base of our national road system. It is fine to have great national highways. I do not knock them but they do not go through too many electorates and they do not assist the great bulk of people who live in country areas. I believe that it is important for this Government, with its concern for country and regional people, to dramatically increase the amount of money available for roads, particularly local roads, in the next Budget.

        My next and final grouch concerns Telecom Australia and trunk call charges. Telecom deserves commendation for the pause between 1975 and January 1982 for any increases in charges. In that time there have been significant reductions in almost all of the eight call charge zones. At the same time Telecom has been required to finance a significant percentage of its capital expenditure from profits. However, I must protest on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of Australians who live in the 165 kilometre to 325 kilometre zone and who suffer the unique disadvantage of being the only group in the community not to receive a reduction in the 1975-1982 period or after January 1982, when some charges will be increased and then reduced. I am referring to the business hour time call period for trunk call charges when business within the capital cities is done. Every other group-seven in total-has had or will receive a reduction for business hour calls. Furthermore, as from January 1982, in this zone there will be an increase from $1.35 to $1.44 for a three minute telephone call. So Telecom is not even holding the present rate, as will at least be the case for the next zone, the 325 kilometre to 485 kilometre zone. This 165 kilometre to 325 kilometre zone is the heartland of decentralised regional industry in Australia and it is not receiving its fair share of the benefits of the new technology which have been passed on to all other telephone subscribers in this nation. I believe the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) should instruct Telecom at the least to maintain the present rate beyond 25 January 1982 when many of the charges will change.

        I now refer to the Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research or ACIAR. I will commend, discuss and question the announcement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) that the Government will establish an international agricultural research centre in Australia concerned with the needs of developing countries. An amount of $25m has been provided for the first four years of that centre. I understand that legislation will be introduced in the near future to establish the centre as a statutory authority. It will be responsible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The legislation will limit the life of the authority to 12 years and provide for an evaluation in the tenth year. A policy advisory council of distinguished Australian and overseas agricultural research scientists will set the priorities for the research to be conducted in and out of Australia. There will be a director and a small staff to implement those priorities. The centre will not actually be a research institute of facility in the ordinary meaning of the word, as is the case with the 13 internationally recognised agricultural research institutions. The centre will contract research work mainly in Australia to existing instititutions, with some research of a joint or collaborative nature being done overseas with the Australian centre being part of the venture. At all times this work will be for the benefit of agriculture in developing countries. I understand that Canada has a similar type of research centre.
       </para>
       <para>
        The overall aim, I am told, is to mobilise Australian agricultural research expertise to a greater degree than is presently possible for the benefit of agriculture in developing countries. This is a sensible and laudible initiative. Australia has particular expertise in legumes, for both tropical and temperate climates, as a replacement for nitrogenous fertilisers, and for grazing. There is expertise in tropical and arid grazing generally and in arid and semi-arid agriculture. Tropical and arid conditions are common features of developing country agriculture, as is grazing and I hope the avoidance of high cost nitrogenous fertilisers.

        However, there are several questions which I want to pose. The first relates to the Australian Development Assistance Bureau and agricultural foreign aid provided by this country. The second concerns the relationship to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, known as CGIAR. The third relates to the gap in international agricultural research in island states, particularly tropical islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Because of our proximity to the emerging nations in this category I believe we have a special responsibility. The next question concerns the relationship to the Asian Vegetable Research Development Centre in Taiwan and its relationship to CGIAR. The next question relates to the ability of the centre, when most of its research work will be done in Australia, to make its research relevant to developing countries, given all the differences that exist in soils, climates, formal structures, societies, et cetera. The final question relates to how successfully the centre will be able to communicate the results of its research to the beneficiary countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first point concerns ADAB. I have been advised that there will be close co-ordination between the Development Assistance Bureau and ACIAR, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. The more applied agricultural research and management consultancy-type of foreign aid which has been the basis of this type of foreign aid so far will continue, and the recommendations for that work will continue to be made through the Consultative Committee on Research and Development. This provides an opportunity for that level of foreign aid through ADAB to spread some of the work that will be done by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second point concerns the relationship to CGIAR or the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. That is one of the more uncertain aspects at this stage. This question of relationship was first raised in this House by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) when commenting on a statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street).

         —Yes, very perceptive. The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research was established in 1971 to support 13 international agricultural research institutions. It was established on a joint basis by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the World Bank and the United Nations Development Program. The 13 supported centres are located in the following countries: Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Italy, Lebanon, India, the United States of America, Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, the Philippines, the Netherlands and Liberia. The two most famous centres are the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines and CIMMYT in Mexico, both initially developed with Ford and Rockefeller foundation money. That is where dramatic breakthroughs in hybrid rice and semi-dwarf wheat have been made to the great benefit of feeding the people of the world.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In 1980, 35 countries contributed $120m to the work of these 13 centres. Australia's contribution was $3m to 12 of the 13. I submit that Australia must maintain its level of support for these existing institutions. It should also support the admission to full membership of the CGIAR supported centre, the Asian Research and Development Centre in Taiwan, which is at present an associate member.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer briefly to the work of the vegetable centre in Taiwan, where pioneering work has been carried out in the development of six vegetables to provide needed protein and vitamins for people in the less developed countries in tropical and semi-tropical areas. Those six vegetables are tomatoes, chinese cabbage, sweet potato, white potato, mung bean and soya bean. More particularly, the majority of the 13 centres that I have referred to plus Taiwan are in tropical and arid areas of the world. So it appears to be important that work at these centres which is already being done is not duplicated by work in Australia; otherwise there would be a waste of money having the centre established here. I refer again to the great need for agricultural research particularly centred on tropical island agriculture, which is in need of international support for research in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. I commend the Government for its initiative in establishing this centre. I will watch its development with interest and question its performance from time to time. I support the Budget.

         —Yes. It is one of the most regressive and despicable documents that this House has seen for many years. It shows no care for the main ingredient of Australia, its people. The people of Australia are once again totally ignored and depressed by many parts of the Budget. The elderly, the young and the family unit I have spoken about in this House on many occasions are all under the hammer in this Budget. The youth of Australia have been callously disregarded with the abandonment of the Community Youth Support Scheme. Many thousands of letters have poured in to honourable members from around Australia. I have received many letters, as I know you have, Mr Deputy Speaker. Many other members have received them also. Many people are complaining because the programs which the Government claims are to replace CYSS in fact do not replace CYSS. Under the majority of training programs one has to be unemployed for four months and, in some cases, for eight months before receiving any training entitlements. Many young people find themselves in a great vacuum because of the abandonment of CYSS.

         —I rise tonight very sadly to talk very briefly about a great unionist-the late Charles John Harris or, as he was called, Charlie Harris-who died yesterday week at 85 years of age. He was a great person and a great unionist. He was a member of the union movement for over half a century and all that time a member of the Australian Theatrical and Amusement Employees Association. He worked in many fields in the theatre, including as spruiker some 40 or 50 years ago. He had many jobs in the theatrical and cinema areas. He was delegate to the Victorian Trades Hall Council for over 40 years. Until recently, when he had an accident, he had in those 40 years on only a handful of occasions missed a meeting of the Trades Hall Council. I believe he was a person who really dedicated his life to the union and the union movement and to the betterment of the people whom he loved and whom he was trying to help throughout his entire life-the little man, the family man, the person who needed assistance. They will all be very saddened to hear of his passing. I think Charlie was one of the greatest unionists. On behalf of every unionist and everyone who knew him I thank him for all the wonderful things he did and the wonderful times we had. I think the Trades Hall Council in Victoria will sadly miss him after his 40 years of wonderful service. I just say these few words tonight on his behalf. He was a great unionist. I feel very sad, as do the members of the Australian Theatrical and Amusement Employees Association, at the passing of one of that union's all time great unionists. I believe the union will, in fact, name a benevolent fund after Charlie. I think that will be a tribute to him for a long time to come.

         —Tonight I pay tribute to a magnificent organisation in my electorate which has been providing invaluable services to the aged in the Perth metropolitan area since 1954. I refer to the League of Home Help for the Sick and Aged. Last Sunday I had the privilege, together with the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), of jointly opening Tormey House-a hostel built by the League with the assistance of substantial Commonwealth funding of more than $350,000. This hostel consists of 24 hostel beds, 12 of which were funded under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act and the remaining 12 under the Aged Persons Hostels Act. This new accommodation for the aged, provided under the auspices of the League, is additional to other Commonwealth subsidised residential accommodation previously established by the League in Leederville and West Perth.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The League commenced operations in 1954 to provide domiciliary services to the aged as a top priority. Its beneficial influence has spread right throughout the metropolitan area of Perth. It has been a pioneer in the development of the Meals on Wheels service. Some 325 meals are delivered daily by a large voluntary band of helpers over a wide geographical area. A wide range of home help services and chiropody and hairdressing services are provided to many elderly people in the community. Through its domiciliary services the League is assisting aged people, not by removing them from the community but by enabling them to continue as far as possible to lead independent lives in the community. This principle is carried through even for those elderly people who find they need the kind of support that hostel accommodation can give by the close linking of the hostels with other social activities managed by this League. The League's accommodation facilities incorporate social centres for non-resident aged people which provide a most important focal point socially in the lives of all who enjoy the League's activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps the most important aspect of the League's work is the way in which it mobilises voluntary help involving hundreds of people in the community. I think this is the greatest commendation that a community organisation such as this League can receive, that so many people are prepared to put their resources, whether of time or money, into supporting its work. This level of community support shows that the League not only commands a great deal of respect for the work it is doing but also is seen as providing services that are really meeting community needs. This gives to its work also I think a very special quality of sincere concern which cannot pertain to government administered organisations. Those whom I have met in this organisation over the years work selflessly, voluntarily and with great dedication and concern for all the aged people who benefit from the wide range of services and activities provided by the League. The League's actions are, in my opinion, the epitome of how welfare sevices should be provided in the community if they are to have special meaning to both the recipients and the providers of these services and if the true integrity of a free society and its people is to be upheld.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tonight I place on record in this Parliament my congratulations to all who are associated with the work of the League: Major A. F. W. Shaw, who has been the League's president for many years and who is a tireless worker for the League; Mr B. Pears, the League's administrator; the members of the League's Council and its executive committee; and also, very importantly, the very many men and women who do so much wonderful work throughout the metropolitan area of Perth in a voluntary capacity on behalf of the elderly in that area.

         —I am pleased that the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) is in the House during this adjournment debate. Only last week the honourable member for Macarthur took issue with an indicator which I chose to adopt to provide evidence of the fact that, despite their claims to the contrary, the coalition parties are not, in fact, small government parties. The point that the honourable member indicated concern about related to a speech which I had made previously. In that speech I gave evidence of the fact that the coalition parties not only were not small government parties but also were high taxing parties, again despite their protestations and claims to the contrary. I looked in vain through the speech that was made by the honourable member for Macarthur to find any reference to the question of the present Government being a high tax government. No such reference was found. No attempt was made by the honourable member for Macarthur to refute that point because it cannot be refuted.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Macarthur suggested that, rather than take as an indicator for the size of government the indicator which I chose-that was one concerning government taxation-we should take the proportion of gross domestic product which makes up government expenditure. I am quite happy to move to that ground. I have made reference on previous occasions to the fact that the honourable member for Macarthur cooks figures. What I will do now is prove that that claim I have made on previous occasions is correct and can be substantiated.
       </para>
       <para>
        If anyone were trying to refute the position I adopted, what he would do, for example, would be to take the highest proportion of gross domestic product represented by total Budget outlays under the Labor Government and then take the lowest proportion under the present Government. If a person wanted to cook the figures, present shonky figures, that is what he would do. That is precisely what the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) did. Let me indicate the evidence for that. During the three years we were in government the highest figure for the proportion of gross domestic product represented by Budget outlays was 30.1 per cent. The lowest during the term of the present Government has been 27.6 per cent. Those are the two figures to which the honourable member for Macarthur made reference.
       </para>
       <para>
        If it had been his intention to be objective and honest-both personally and politically honest-in relation to the figures he was going to use, a more appropriate and more indicative figure surely would have been the average figure during the period of the Labor Government and the average figure during the period of the Liberal Government. Let us take those averages and see how they come out. During the three years of the Labor Government the average figure was 27.6 per cent. During the six years of this Government the average figure has been 28.4 per cent. So the percentage has been higher during the period in which the Government benches have been occupied by the coalition parties. It has taken this Government six years to reach a figure equal to the average figure which applied during the three years of the Labor Government. We are not in the business of competing against coalition parties in relation to statistics of this kind. We did not create the argument in the first place. The coalition parties have maintained that they have small government objectives. The figures I have given, on the grounds chosen by the honourable member for Macarthur, indicate that, contrary to the claims the coalition parties have made, that simply is not correct.

         —At present we have one of the worst strike hold-ups of all time on our eastern seaboard. Ships are idle off the ports of Newcastle, Sydney and Port Kembla, waiting to load valuable cargoes of Australian commodities for overseas, particularly our coal, our grain and our iron ore. I was speaking last night to the President of the Australian Coal Association, who is also President of the New South Wales body. He expressed great concern at the hold-up in the loading of these ships and the effect it was having on Australia's trade overseas. A total of 60 ships are waiting off the coast at present and, with demurrage at rates from $10,000 to $15,000 per day, the hold-up is costing $2m a day. That is a great loss to this country which has to be met by the coal companies and the shipping companies, not by the overseas authorities. It can be seen that this great shipping problem is causing disruption to the trade and economy of this country. Overseas buyers are now looking to other countries. We are not the only country where coal, iron ore and grain is produced. They cannot rely on Australia as a reliable shipping source.

        Three weeks ago three men had a fight on a tug and one of them was stood down. What happened? We had a strike on our eastern seaboard for three weeks. We got that settled, and now we have another strike with a marine union. This has tied up shipping in all our ports. Not only overseas ships but also Australian ships are held up, and this is causing great problems in the supply of fuel throughout our eastern seaboard. Northern New South Wales, the south coast and South Australia are having great difficulty in securing fuel. Ships coming from Bass Strait to the Australian Oil Refining Pty Ltd refinery in Sydney and to the Shell company's refinery at Clyde are tied up. Overseas ships coming in with crude oil to be refined in our refineries are having exactly the same problems. If we cannot get fuel into the northern wheat belt and to industrial concerns and transport in that area, we will have great problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Kurnell refinery in Sydney, of course, provides two-thirds of the fuel for New South Wales, and there is no fuel in the port of Newcastle at the present time. Getting the little fuel that is in Sydney into the country areas is costly and is causing great problems. Kurnell has five days supply of fuel left, and unless the strike is settled immediately transport will come to a complete standstill. A total of 66 shipping days have been lost this year. This would not happen in any other port in the world. The chief officer of the Alioth which arrived off the port of Newcastle on 2 July to load coal for Japan, said that this is the worst port in the world. Ships will get their coal from somewhere else. As I mentioned a while ago, we are not the only country in the world that is producing coal. Marine engineers are claiming a 10 per cent pay increase, and increased leave and sick leave provisions. Surely some sanity can be brought to these people. Surely they must realise the damage they are doing to the economy of this country, the work force, and everybody in it. I understand that representations have been made to the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt). I hope that this Government can take some action and bring sanity into the situation which exists in our ports.

         —The Government's education policies are damaging Australia's future technological and educational advancement as well as depriving young people of opportunities at a time when youth unemployment is at a critical level. Educationists from schools, colleges of advanced education and universities both inside and outside my electorate have approached me with their deep concern about the Government's changes to education and the haste with which they are being introduced. It is my opinion that Australia is facing a watershed in its education history and that without proper planning our future educational advancement and, therefore, advancement in every other sphere, will be threatened. The position of colleges of advanced education is of particular concern. They are being subjected to cuts in funding and thus the number of student places they are able to offer. They are also being forced to amalgamate. Existing courses will suffer and the lack of funds will mean that no initiatives in new courses will be taken in response to the needs of the community.

        The Rusden State College, on the border of my electorate, which has been described by the Advanced Education Council as a centre of excellence, has told me that its amalgamation and the resulting reduction in funding of $487 per student from 1981 to 1982 will mean that existing courses will have to be cut back drastically. The amalgamation of colleges of advanced education was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 30 April this year. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Arising from the recommendations of the Tertiary Education Commission, the Government will promote a major rationalisation and reallocation of resources in higher education. This will involve consolidation into larger units of 30 existing colleges of advanced education, for which teacher education is the main activity, by their incorporation into multi-purpose or multi-campus colleges with a single governing body or by integration with neighbouring universities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not a word was then said by the Prime Minister of his intention to cut the college's funds. Is it any wonder that no one in his right mind trusts the Prime Minister any longer? The most damning thing about the Government's education policy is that the prime criterion determining it is the crazy obsession to cut costs. No consideration has been given to maintaining and improving the level of education.

         —There has been some recent editorial comment on the advantages of the Government introducing a national superannuation scheme. I speak this evening in support of the establishment of a wide-ranging, in-depth study of this proposal. I emphasise that there are no easy options facing the community in the funding of future social welfare benefits. Those who wish to provide for national superannuation must be willing to pay for it. The need for this study rests upon the following facts: The number of people relying on the Government for income support payments is continuing to grow as an increasing percentage of the working age population. There is a potentially significant increase in the welfare needs of the aging population which must be exacerbated as the community's life expectancy tends to increase. The percentage of taxpayers relative to the number of recipients is tending to fall and there is growing taxpayer resistance to an increase in the real burden of taxation to support those who may not be in the work force.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There can be no doubt that a government's social and welfare policies must take into account population trends within the economy, in particular the impact of an aging population. Obviously, a younger population is able to create more economic growth than an aging one. Trends in the Australian age structure suggest that there has been a significant decline in the net reproduction rate since 1976, and it is still falling. I table the appropriate graphs on this matter. Unless there is a continuous and significant growth in the rate of productivity there will be an increasing burden on fewer people to pay for the social services of a growing population. (Quorum formed). The number of people over the age of 65 years will increase by two-thirds by the end of the century. Those aged 75 and over will double. The current ratio of workers to dependants is three to one. By the year 2010, on the basis of present expected trends, this ratio could be as low as two to one. Accordingly, unless those in the work force are prepared to pay additional taxation to support those who are not the present level of social security entitlements will be under extreme pressure.
       </para>
       <para>
        The time has come for the community to consider seriously how we can continue to pay on an annual basis from revenue a total pension bill which is currently 28 cents in every dollar of taxation. The alternatives we are facing are twofold. Firstly, we may continue the present system of funding social welfare out of consolidated revenue and watch a growing percentage of the Budget going in that direction or, secondly, we can develop and introduce a universal occupational superannuation program which would involve all in the work force being members of superannuation funds managed by employers or institutions to which they would make a percentage contribution of salary supplemented by an employer contribution. However, for a long transition period, probably 15 years, the working population would have to contribute to existing pension funding through taxation as well as contributing to superannuation. A viable national superannuation program would require flexibility between employment and preferably the right to change funds. Contributions would attract a tax rebate similar to that for basic health cover.

He seems to have forgotten that by taking a simple average he is showing not only a simple approach but also a simple-minded approach to the realities of Budget statistics. Perhaps it is a little late for him to be educated but I will try to do something to help him now. He may have noticed that in the 1973-74 Budget government expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product was 23.8 per cent.

The trend was up in terms of big government under Labor. Under the present Government the figure has fallen from Labor's 30.1 per cent to 27.6 per cent. For anyone to pretend in this House that a rise under Labor is better than a fall in terms of big government under the present Government shows not only a curious approach but also, as I suggested, a simple-minded approach to economics. It demonstrates what kind of economic management we would have if the fellows opposite ever got back on the Treasury benches.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It is assumed that the amount of savings refers to the $300 000 shown in the Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations made by:
      </para>
      <para>
       Act No. 141 of 1980-Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1980-81
      </para>
      <para>
       Act No. 142 of 1980-Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1980-81
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) The saving of $300 000 in salaries for 1980-81 relates to net under-expenditure in the salary appropriation of the Commonwealth Institute of Health which is a part of the Department of Health. This arose because of inability to fill a number of Research Medical Officer and other positions with highly specialised qualification requirements, and a lower than estimated amount needed for salary increments. The saving relates only to the Department and not to the statutory authorities within the Health portfolio.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Health Insurance Commission and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission are trading authorities and decisions on the staffing of individual positions in these organisations are based on commercial considerations. Details regarding individual positions have therefore been provided only in respect of the Department and the Capital Territory Health Commission.

       My Department has sought information from the New Zealand authorities who have advised that dogs and cats may not be imported into New Zealand direct from Western Samoa. They have no knowledge of illegal importations from that country.

      <para>
       In the past the New Zealand authorities have permitted a small number of pets on yachts to be imported following an authenticated history of complete isolation aboard the yacht for at least 9 months. It would have been possible for a cat from Western Samoa to have entered New Zealand by this means. My Department has been advised that this practice has now ceased and that New Zealand only imports dogs and cats from Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom in accordance with their standard quarantine conditions.

       Mid-Western Television Pty Ltd was offered the grant of licences for Southern Cross, Merredin, Baandee, Tammin, York and Meckering/Northam in 1978. An additional licence for Koolyanobbing was offered in September 1979. The licence for Merredin was granted on 26 June 1980.

       Implementation of these services is to be on a stage by stage basis. Timing will be dependent upon my consideration of a submission recently prepared by my Department in relation to a request by Mid-Western Television Pty Ltd for changes to the operating conditions of the proposed services.
      </para>
      <para>
       Should I subsequently consider it appropriate to amend the operating conditions as the potential licensee wishes, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will be advised. The Tribunal would then be able to prepare the licences and attach the appropriate technical operating conditions. With these licences Mid-Western Television would then be in a position to expedite installation of the translator service.

      </para>
      <para>
       (4) My Department does not have the facilities or the resources to conduct properly controlled clinical statistical studies nor can it direct that such studies be undertaken. I am advised however that in 1978 the National Cancer Institute in the United States filed an Investigational New Drug application with the Food and Drug Administration for testing Laetrile in patients with cancer. The trial commenced in July 1980 when one hundred and seventy-eight patients were enrolled in the study which was undertaken at four cancer research centres. The trial was co-ordinated by the Mayo Clinic and the results presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Washington on 30 April 1981. The results indicated that Laetrile was ineffective as a treatment for cancer.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) One cannot conclude from Mr McCarty's articles that he is either right or wrong. However in his second article printed in 1976 he insisted that fair controlled clinical trials of Laetrile be permitted and encouraged in the United States of America. These have now been carried out with the result indicated above.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Transition education programs are being promoted by the Government. Under the Transition from School to Work Program in 1980, a total of $17m was advanced to the six States, the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory for transition programs in government and non-government schools and Technical and Further Education institutions. In 1981, $26.9m has already been approved for transition programs. On 4 June 1981 I informed Parliament of Government decisions which will have the effect of increasing funds available for transition education and training programs to up to $75.4m in 1982.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) As indicated in reply to (1), funding for transition programs is increasing substantially in real terms and, under policies announced by the Commonwealth, will continue to do so until 1984.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Commonwealth's offer to the States in November 1979 in respect of the Transition Program provided for specified financial arrangements for the years 1980 to 1984. It is not usual for the Commonwealth to specify for a period as long as five years the amounts it is willing to contribute under such a program, but it was considered that this arrangement would assist forward planning by education authorities in an area of particular concern to both the Commonwealth and the States.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Commonwealth has informed the States that arrangements for transition education beyond 1984 will be reviewed with the States in 1983 prior to agreement with them on the 1984 program. That the Commonwealth's offer of November 1979 covers the year 1980-1984 does not imply that programs would be terminated. Consideration of longer term arrangements will take place well before the time when the current arrangements expire.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The research report for the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority, entitled 'A Case Study Evaluation' has been drawn to my notice. This report shows that a promising start has been made to the Transition Program in the Australian Capital Territory and that a number of worthwhile projects have been supported under this Program including the project at Narrabundah College. Narrabundah College received funding in 1980 under the Transition Program for the provision of an alternative program for students at risk in making the transition to employment, and has received further funding in Term 1 of 1981 to continue this project. Allocation of funds for 1982 under the Transition Program to Australian Capital Territory schools and colleges has not yet been decided, but the needs of Narrabundah College will be considered along with those of other Australian Capital Territory schools and colleges involved in transition activities.

      <para>
       (1) Has his attention been drawn to the current controversy surrounding the use of the pour-on sheep dip known as Clout manufactured by the Wellcome company; if so, when did he first become aware of the controversy.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Does he intend to take any action to protect Australia's multi-million dollar trade in sheep skins from any adverse effects stemming from the use of Clout; if not, why not.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) What action does he intend to take to ensure that farmers are in a position to make informed decisions on whether or not to use Clout, and if they are to use it, to ensure that they understand what the implications are for their marketing decision.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>

      <para>
       (1) Yes. The possibility of adverse effects on tanned sheepskins first came to my attention during May 1981.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Commonwealth's involvement in this matter is restricted to providing the Chairman and Secretariat for the Technical Committee on Veterinary Drugs (TCVD), which is a subsidiary of the Australian Agricultural Council and the Standing Committee on Agriculture. The TCVD has a co-ordinating role in the evaluation of veterinary drugs but the registration and control of agricultural chemicals in Australia is the responsibility of the States.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Information brought to my attention was referred to the TCVD for urgent consideration. TCVD has now evaluated the new information placed before it and has agreed upon additional interim measures. These have been brought to the attention of the State registration authorities and the manufacturer. It is expected that the States will take prompt action to implement the TCVD recommendations which propose more detailed labelling to enable farmers to make informed decisions. The proposed measures are of an interim nature and the matter is being kept under constant review by TCVD.
