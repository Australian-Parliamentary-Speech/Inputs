              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOL" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COLBECK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians and Minister for Youth and Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  I want to thank the Senate for the chance to further outline the government's record and commitment to preventing and tackling COVID-19 in aged care and how that has evolved as we learn more about this virus. These are extraordinary times—times of great tragedy for so many and full of emotion, pain and grief. I would like to extend my condolences to the families and loved ones of the more than 360 older Australians who have lost their lives from COVID-19, each one of which is a tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We continue to work day and night as a government to safeguard the most vulnerable in our community. The care and welfare of senior Australians has been and remains the highest priority for the Australian government. I, as minister for aged care, along with the Minister for Health, the Prime Minister, the government and the national cabinet at every step of this pandemic have acted on the advice of our medical experts, including the chief medical officer, the team of deputy chief medical officers and also the various subcommittees of experts who provide advice to the government—the AHPPC, the CDNA, the ICEG and now the AHPPC Aged Care Advisory Group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been working every day with the aged care sector—providers, staff and families—to ensure that these people in care, those who first cared for us, receive the highest level of protection. For this I am accountable. We've heard the stories of heartbreak as this virus has impacted on our senior Australians. I've spoken directly with scores of families. Through tears they've told me of their mums and dads: the contributions they've made to their family and their community and how they should never have spent their final hours isolated and alone. I've also been in almost daily contact with providers, facility managers and staff who have shared similar stories of distress. We have had to learn about this novel virus and continue to learn and apply those learnings to our response to new outbreaks. There have been missteps, though. During last Friday's Senate hearing I didn't have details to hand that I should have. Again, I apologise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. There are few countries anywhere in the world where there has been coronavirus and where they have been able to avoid outbreaks in residential aged care. Where there is widespread community transmission there is a significant impact, and unfortunately—and tragically—there are deaths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our swift and decisive action, our frontline response, our decisions about borders, our national pandemic plan and our hospital agreements—the strength of the public health response in Australia—has seen us avoid the scale of tragedy in aged care seen in so many other countries. Our early response has ensured that so far 97 per cent of our aged-care facilities have not had a COVID-infected resident. That is a high-water mark compared to other regions in the world, like the UK, which is battling COVID-19 in 56 per cent of its facilities. It's a heartbreaking reality that in some countries they have stopped counting aged-care deaths altogether. Every death in aged care as a result of this COVID-19 pandemic is a tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a far from perfect aged-care system. That is why one of the first acts of the Morrison government was to call the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety to address the systematic problems that have existed for decades. In my tenure as aged-care minister, significant changes were made even as the royal commission continued to undertake its work. Some of these things included: completing work on the new, independent Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission; implementing new consumer-focused Aged Care Quality Standards; introducing a new National Aged Care Mandatory Quality Indicator Program; and implementing a new single Charter of Aged Care Rights covering 14 fundamental protections relating to safety, quality care, independence, control, fairness and choice. We have mandated requirements to reduce the use of chemical and physical restraints and improved medication management in residential care. We've invested in the implementation of a Serious Incident Response Scheme, and we've invested in dementia research. We have provided a Business Improvement Fund to assist residential aged-care facilities in financial difficulties, including prioritising those in regional, rural and remote areas, and those impacted by bushfires earlier this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the 2018-19 budget, we have invested more than $3 billion in home-care packages to support more Australians to remain living in their own homes for longer. That's an increase of more than 50,000 home-care packages and, for the first time, we've seen the national waiting list decline. We are delivering record investment in the aged-care system, from $13.3 billion under Labor to $21.4 billion this financial year and $25.4 billion in 2022-23. But more reform is needed. We will not sit idle, and the work continues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 pandemic has had the undivided attention of the government from the outset. The wellbeing of our most vulnerable has been our highest priority right from the beginning. As the former Chief Medical Officer, and now the Secretary of the Department of Health, said in a statement to the royal commission:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has, at all times, had the protection of elderly Australians at the forefront of our approach to COVID-19 and this has dominated our planning and preparedness. Any suggestion to the contrary is strongly rejected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We commenced our planning in January—very early in the cycle of this devastating global pandemic. We closed our borders, and we released our national response, which included the overarching plan for the management of COVID-19: the Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). We published the advice of the CDNA to the sector on 13 March. This document has since been updated twice as our understanding of the virus has grown. We negotiated hospital agreements—which have proved to be so vital, Mr President, particularly in your home state of Victoria—to safeguard older Australians and to release pressure on stressed facilities and, importantly, to provide additional workforce capacity into aged-care facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We negotiated and resourced surge-workforce capacity, an announcement we made on 11 March, and we continue to build on that capacity. Almost 1,000 Commonwealth-funded surge staff have been deployed into aged-care facilities just in Victoria, plus ADF and AUSMAT teams. We secured and built a substantial national stockpile of PPE, so vital in the fight against COVID-19, at a time of global shortage. We negotiated and signed a national testing contract to ensure that residents and workers in infected facilities could be tested quickly for the virus. We conduct asymptomatic testing in COVID-19 hotspots throughout Victoria. We developed nine training modules, including infection control and PPE use, and made those freely available to the sector. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner has conducted cycles of preparedness testing for the sector, and that work continues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the AHPPC and national cabinet, we've provided advice on visitation and worked closely with the sector to develop a very successful code of conduct for visitation. We put in place communication systems to assist facilities that weren't able to maintain contact with family and loved ones so that they understood what was happening with their family members. We commissioned investigations and acted quickly on the learnings of Dorothy Henderson Lodge and Newmarch. In Victoria, as the scale of the outbreak grew, we established the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre, which brought together the decision-making of both the state and the Commonwealth and played a significant role in managing an extremely difficult situation that has developed in Victoria. That structure has now been endorsed by national cabinet for application, if required, in other states and territories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We meet every day—sometimes twice a day—to ensure that every resource required is directed to the effort. We have placed no limits on those resources, with over $1 billion committed to our COVID-19 response to aged care to date.</span>

I sat with her while she cried, because she hadn't been able to address that issue for four years. She came into my office. We sat, we talked and we worked our way through what could be done and what will be done, and I tried to help her with her pain. It's those sorts of stories and those that we heard from the royal commission that drive me and that drive the government to improve the residential aged-care sector in this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maybe you should stay and listen to what the Senate has to say, Minister Colbeck. As of yesterday there were 353 Australians in residential aged care who had died from COVID-19, and today it's more than 360. It is a disgrace that this minister leaves the chamber when the parliament is taking note of his statement. I hope all Australian see how he just turned his back on his accountability and responsibility in this parliament and did not have the honour and principle to stay and listen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 353 dead as of yesterday, 360 dead as of today and more than 1,100 active cases. These numbers tell a tragic story. They are not just numbers. Behind each of these is a story of heartache, grief and trauma experienced by the families, children, grandchildren, siblings and friends of each and every one of these older Australians who has died. Now, it is true: we are in the grips of a global pandemic. And there are some who would suggest, like the government, these deaths are unavoidable. But we would be betraying our duty if we blindly accepted that argument. We would be blindly betraying our duty to the more than 360 Australians who have died and their loved ones, we would be betraying our duty to the 200,000 Australians in aged care and we would be betraying our duty to those who put themselves at risk every day to care for them. You see, this was avoidable. It was foreseeable and it was anticipated. Senator Colbeck said today that this has been the government's highest priority. That is demonstrably untrue. You see, Senator Colbeck was warned. He knew aged care was in crisis before COVID hit. Just as they had been warned before the bushfires last summer, this Morrison government has had warning after warning after warning on aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was the interim report of the royal commission, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>; the warnings from experts and from unions representing workers in aged-care homes; the tragic events at Dorothy Henderson Lodge and Newmarch House earlier this year; the warnings from his own backbenchers; and the lessons from his own government's report in March and in June. So, just as in the bushfires, the failure to act on these warnings—that minister's failure, this government's failure—has left devastating consequences for Australians. Instead of acting on these warnings, Senator Colbeck comes into this place and denies the premise of almost every question. He comes into this place and he claims to have done his job by holding a webinar and doing some mail-outs. Worse still, he comes into this place and talks about the Morrison government's performance as a high-water mark—a high-water mark! What that demonstrates is how profoundly amoral, how profoundly dishonourable the heart of this government is, and what it reveals is this government's continued preference for self-congratulation over action under Scott Morrison. It's the arrogance and hubris that the counsel assisting the royal commission spoke of. It is dishonourable and it is unprincipled. This minister abdicates responsibility, and the cost of his failure is borne by hundreds of grieving Australian families who are still trying to come to terms with immeasurable tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is one notable action this government has taken in relation to aged care and that is to defund it. As Treasurer, Mr Morrison cut almost $2 billion from the aged-care budget, and the results of that action, the consequences, are being seen today. In fact, it was one of their own, Mr Broadbent, who said it was a disaster waiting to happen. He went on to say his warnings, too, were 'ignored completely'. Tragically, all the other warnings that the Morrison government has received were also ignored completely. The royal commission heard this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… in the crucial months between the Newmarch House outbreak in April and mid-June a degree of self-congratulation and even hubris was displayed by the Commonwealth Government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government was too business with boasting, too busy making announcements—just as Mr Morrison still is this week—to actually care that their job was not done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's obvious that they sat on the reports, because those reports made clear the consequences of government action, or failure to act, and made clear the consequences of the government's actions to cut nearly $2 billion from aged care. Every day this week, before and after his disastrous committee performance, Australians have seen the horrifying death toll climb, and that is a consequence of budget cuts. It is a consequence of ignored warnings, and it is a consequence of incompetence by this government and, specifically, this minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us have heard harrowing stories of severe neglect. Brendan from Victoria, whom we spoke about yesterday, said his 94-year-old mother, removed from her room after testing positive for COVID-19, was found not to have been showered for four days due to staffing shortages. Elizabeth, also from Victoria, said hospital doctors found her mother also had a secondary chest infection and a UTI, in addition to COVID, and she had been left in soiled nappies for hours—on many occasions, for the whole day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the people we are supposed to be representing in this place today. These are the people who need a voice. This minister seeks today to dismiss this debate as political. Well, I have a human question of my fellow senators, a question for all of you: would any of you want your loved ones to be in Senator Colbeck's care? When we look at Senator Colbeck's performance in the Senate, when we look at his performance in the Senate select committee, when we look at his performance as a minister, that is the question. Would you trust your parents, your grandparents, your aunts or uncles, your brothers or sisters, your wives or husbands to Senator Colbeck's care? If not, why would you expect other Australians to trust their loved ones to his care? Why would you accept a Prime Minister forcing Australians to put their elderly loved ones into Senator Colbeck's care? It is that's simple. If you wouldn't want him to be in charge of the care of your loved one, why do you expect others to want that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this Prime Minister. Although he is too stubborn to sack Senator Colbeck, he knows he can't fix this mess. We know that because just this week the Prime Minister cut Senator Colbeck out of the emergency response decision-making. Consider that for a minute. Mr Morrison has so little confidence in this minister that he's taken him out of the decision-making process. So I say to this government: if even Mr Morrison knows that Senator Richard Colbeck isn't up to the job, why should any of us expect Australians to believe that he is? The fact is that Senator Richard Colbeck has lost the confidence of the parliament, he has lost the confidence of the public, and he has to go.</span>

Every time I hear the government gloat about their performance, I think of the pain that must be inflicted upon the family members of those who have died in residential aged care of COVID-19—the daughter who lost a father, the son who lost a mother, the grandchildren asking what happened to nan and pop? The idea that the government got it right, that they have a high-water mark 97 per cent of the time, would be cold comfort to those 353 families who have lost a loved one in residential aged care to coronavirus and to those over 1,100 families who right now have a family member with an active coronavirus case in residential aged care.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share a story. Donna from Clifton Springs, near Geelong in Victoria, shared her pain. She lost her father, Patrick, to COVID-19 on Monday a week ago. He caught COVID-19 in the aged-care facility. Donna wrote: 'On the news I watched with disgust as the Prime Minister talked about aged care. For him to say 97 per cent of the time we have got it right, along with Richard Colbeck's complete lack of care and concern for what has happened, is a complete slap in the face to families like mine who have been affected by this tragedy. Dad was 90 but was in good health. He was an amazing man who loved his family dearly and who could answer more questions on <span style="font-style:italic;">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</span><span style="font-style:italic;">?</span> than you or I. He did not deserve to die the way he did. I believe together we can all help to implement change in the industry, such as mandatory infection control for all staff, so this does not happen again. Dad died an unnecessary death and I don't want that to be in vain.' One of the saddest parts of Donna's story is that when she asked her father if he wanted to come live with her at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, he said, 'No, I'm safe in here.' People like Donna's father, Patrick, entered aged care to be looked after and cared for in their older years. At the time Donna contacted my office her father was one of 107 cases in that aged-care facility alone.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">All those people, the thousands of people in aged care across Australia, and their loved ones deserve a government that's got a plan to keep them safe. Instead, they have a government that has let them down. My heart breaks for the people across Australia who have lost loved ones in aged care to COVID-19. Our thoughts are with all the families dealing with grief and loss, particularly people in Victoria, whose grief would be compounded by the lockdown.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In question time yesterday, when asked about his handling of this crisis, the aged-care minister rejected the premise or the assertion in the question no less than eight times. The Prime Minister even gloated in his party room this week about how his government handled the COVID aged-care crisis. What type of person, let alone a Prime Minister, gloats when families are losing loved ones? What type of Prime Minister flippantly dismisses questions? What type of minister comes into the Senate and dismisses questions outright? Is the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians unable to answer these questions because the answers are so bad or because he is so incompetent? When it comes to aged care the federal government is in charge. They fund aged care, they regulate aged care, they have the legislation that determines the quality of aged care. No matter how much the government or Mr Morrison might claim the responsibility is shared, they are responsible for aged care. The buck stops with the Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of treating this global pandemic of a highly contagious disease particularly affecting older people with the seriousness that it deserves, the Morrison government has failed. Mr Morrison left Senator Colbeck in charge of aged care. He is an incompetent junior minister who is in over his head. He is a minister who said this week that we are 'extremely fortunate'—these are his words—in how COVID has been handled in residential aged care. He said Australia is in 'a relatively good position' and the government had done reasonably well. Senator Colbeck is a minister who hasn't even briefed his cabinet about the crisis in aged care. He hasn't even briefed the national cabinet about the crisis in aged care. This is a minister who can't remember, or didn't bother to learn, how many people had died in residential aged care when he appeared before the Senate COVID committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government failed to have a competent minister and failed to have a plan for the COVID-19 crisis unfolding on their watch. Evidence heard at the royal commission into aged care has confirmed that there was no plan. This week, royal commissioners stated that 'independent measurement and public reporting is essential for the good operation of the aged-care system'. The royal commission said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is unacceptable that in 2020 the aged care system is still without this. Had the Australian Government acted upon previous reviews of aged care, the persistent problems in aged care would have been known much earlier and the suffering of many people could have been avoided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the royal commission saying that the government's failure to have a plan has led to the suffering of older Australians in their care. The Prime Minister and his aged-care minister have failed to act. They've failed to equip the aged-care workforce with the training and equipment that they need to protect older Australians. Elizabeth from Williamstown, Victoria, contacted my office and shared her story. It's the one Senator Wong alluded to. I'd like to share Elizabeth's words with the chamber. This is about her mother, who contracted COVID-19 in aged care: 'The residents had been kept in their rooms 24 hours a day without fresh air or mobility. My mother was asking me to tell them to give her pills for her to die today. When she went to hospital with COVID symptoms, they found she also had a secondary infection in her chest and a UTI. She has been left in soiled nappies for hours on end and on many occasions for a whole day. I feel sorry for the staff, they are so under-resourced, and the manager is happy that I am complaining, saying, "You can be my voice."' What kind of system is it where it's the children of desperately ill people—who want to die rather than stay in the aged-care system run by the Morrison government—that the staff are relying on to speak up for them? That's because the government haven't listened. They haven't listed to the frontline workers, they haven't listened to the Health Services Union and they haven't listened to the aged-care royal commission. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These stories are hard to hear. I acknowledge that. Minister Colbeck clearly feels uncomfortable—so uncomfortable he had to leave the chamber and not hear these stories. Well, he should feel uncomfortable. This is  happening on his watch during his time as the minister. He is responsible. Minister Colbeck is overseeing a system where older Australians are being left soiled for days on end. Minister Colbeck needs to own the fact that, as the <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eglect</span> report found, older Australians are going malnourished in residential aged care. They've been left with maggots in their mouths and ants in their open wounds. The aged-care system is broken and it needs to be fixed, and if Minister Colbeck can't do that they need to get a minister in there who can. They need to do it and they need to do it now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got dark days ahead—Victoria remains in lockdown—to get the spread of COVID-19 under control. Sadly, we are going to see more people die in residential aged care. My heart breaks for them, for their families and for the workers in aged care who entered their profession to protect and to care for older Australians. Until we have a vaccine for COVID-19, we must be doing everything we can to protect aged-care residents. What is unfolding across Australia's aged-care system is tragic. It is devastatingly sad. But the saddest thing of all is that all of this was preventable, if only the Morrison government had listened and acted, and had a plan to protect some of our most precious and vulnerable citizens in residential aged care. </span>

                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  If this is government putting aged care as their top priority, I'd hate to think what's happening in other areas that aren't top priority. This, supposedly, gets the government's undivided attention. What happens when there's something that hasn't got the government's undivided attention? How did we get to the position where the government is comparing what happened elsewhere to what happens in Australia and is saying that we are doing relatively well? How did we get to the position where people are reporting finding their loved ones with insects and ants crawling over their wounds, where people know that their loved ones are not being fed and that they're lying in soiled nappies? That is not doing anything but being atrocious. It is not being reasonably well managed. It is just so appalling that, having looked at what was happening overseas, we didn't act to put in place the strongest measures possible to ensure that COVID did not get into our aged-care facilities. At the COVID committee, the minister has a number of times stated, 'The disease is coming in with the care workers, so it was inevitable.' But what we find from the information that's now coming out of Victoria is that in fact the healthcare workers and the care workers are catching it in their workplace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For years, people have been talking about the poor conditions in aged care. We have a royal commission, so now the Prime Minister says, 'We can't do anything; we can't make too many changes,' and the minister says, 'We can't make too many changes because of the royal commission.' We have a royal commission because the position was so bad. Knowing that very well, we went into the pandemic without the proper plans in place to make sure that we would stop COVID getting in. We know it wasn't inevitable, as the government and, in particular, the minister say, because there are facilities that have managed to keep it out. Yesterday I articulated in this place the measures that were taken in February and March by some providers, and, when a healthcare worker did get COVID, it did not go any further. So it was not inevitable that it would spread. It is another symptom of this government's flawed approach to aged care. I've said in this place a number of times that there have been 35 reports over 40 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government came in seven years ago. They have had that time to take much more urgent action on aged care. But what do they do? Instead of fixing it, we get a royal commission and then we can kick it off even further down the track. We've known for a long time that there wasn't the adequate level of care in aged-care facilities. Residents need four hours and 18 minutes daily; that's what the research shows. We need at least $3.5 billion to be invested. What do the Prime Minister and the minister say? They say, 'We're going to mention that in the budget, potentially.' It's too late then. Invest the money now. You know very well that we need increased care. We know very well that we need workforce. Yes, we need a surge workforce, but we actually need a permanent increase of workforce in aged-care facilities. We know we need to improve clinical care because we've documented that in the last Senate report on aged care. We know that the clinical care in aged-care facilities is not up to scratch. We know that aged-care providers are actually confused about their duty of care. Knowing this, the government does nothing to address the clinical care needs and nothing to address that issue around duty of care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many faults in our aged-care system. And the government is saying, 'Leave it to the royal commission, and then we'll make a few ad hoc allocations of resources as an issue bobs up.' We still aren't seeing the retention bonus being made available to all workers in aged-care facilities, because apparently aged-care residents only get COVID from the healthcare workers, not from the other allied support workers in there, nor from the cleaners, nor from the cooks—apparently. How many times does the government have to be told that this is a significant issue and that you can't kick the can down the road? You have to deal with it now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sick of being told we're making this political. This is a government. This is politics. This is a crisis situation, and the government needs to respond. If it takes us standing up every day in this chamber and saying, 'You are not doing it right,' we will keep doing that. Certainly the Greens will, and I'm seeing nods from the opposition as well. This needs to be brought to the government's attention because we need that level of investment. We need those plans from every single provider. This is not just about Victoria. We could see this situation replicated across this country, because this government cannot stand up with its hand on its heart and say that every single aged-care facility in this country is COVID-ready—because they are not. They simply are not COVID-ready. We've seen what's happened in Victoria. That could happen anywhere else in this country if COVID-19, unfortunately, breaks out again, because, as I said, not all of these facilities and providers can say that they are totally prepared. They don't have the workforce. There's not a surge workforce in place. This is not having a go at the workers, because they're working so hard to protect older Australians right now, but they either weren't provided with infectious disease control training—it's not mandatory—or they were given it online. In retrospect, the government sort of think maybe that wasn't a good idea, and they will try to do it face to face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been 74 spot checks in Victoria and, I think, 34 in New South Wales. Spot checks aren't good enough. Random spot checks aren't good enough. Providers all need to be prepared. They need to be following the examples of those topnotch providers who thought about this in February and March, which is when this government should have been out there with every provider.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our regulator needs more staff. It needs more grunt. We've been calling for that for years and years in terms of  improving regulations and improving clinical care. More and more aged-care facilities now are subacute care providers. We know they don't properly understand clinical care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been calling for the list of all the facilities in Victoria that have a COVID-19 outbreak. We still have not been provided with that full list, only with a list of those facilities that have over five cases. Providers are saying they need that list. What is the government's response? 'The Victorian heat maps will tell you where it is.' The heat maps are not detailed enough. Again, the government is not being transparent and not being accountable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Invest the money that's needed—now. Increase the hours of care—making sure you've got nurses on, making sure that the care is properly provided, making sure that all aged-care facilities are prepared for a potential outbreak. One thing you can do for the loved ones of those who have died is promise that this won't happen anywhere else. But you're not demonstrating that you are learning from this experience. You are not demonstrating that you will commit the funding that is needed or put in place the plans. You are not even demonstrating that you understand the extent of what is happening and what you need to do to fix this crisis. Give older Australians hope that, if they need care, it will be there, and that they are not literally risking their lives if they go into residential care, which is what is happening now. I would not let my mum go into residential aged care at this point, because I cannot guarantee her safety if I did. And I know other Australians around this country will be thinking exactly the same thing. I know that there are providers out there who want to do the right thing by older Australians. Support them to do that. Make sure you've got the plans in place.</span>

                  </a>  Aged care has been stressed since well before the pandemic. That is the fault of government, not necessarily the exclusive fault of the current minister, who has only been in the job for just over a year. I think we should recognise that, to be fair. The pandemic came along and there could, properly, be some excuse for an imperfect response. Certainly, that is the case for the first wave. However, the government knew that there was the possibility of a second wave. Yet, on the evidence that's been provided to COVID committees and, indeed, to the chamber, no plan was put in place to deal with a second wave, to deal with what could come as a result of a second wave. We now have a total of just over 350 elderly Australians that have passed because of the pandemic.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281558" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ASKEW</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:16</span>):  I'm pleased to continue my contribution to the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Improving Assistance for Vulnerable and Disadvantaged Families) Bill 2020. I mentioned in my earlier contribution that with the childcare relief package around 99 per cent of childcare providers kept their doors open throughout this pandemic. Around one million families received free child care during the coronavirus pandemic under the Australian government's plan to support families and help the early childhood education and care sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like with so many of us here in this place, early in the outbreak of COVID-19, childcare concerns of both parents and providers were one of the most regular concerns raised with my office, and the prompt response by Minister Tehan and our government was warmly welcomed. I would like to place on record my thanks to the Tasmanian childcare providers for sharing their stories and concerns with me during this time and for their dedicated service to our children through those times of uncertainty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 13 July, our transition package, which included a payment of 25 per cent of a provider's pre-COVID revenue, has supported childcare centres around Australia. Centres in Victoria have benefited from additional support in response to the situation there as well. This bill clearly shows that, following the return to the demand-driven childcare subsidy system on 13 July 2020, we are committed to improving access to child care for vulnerable and disadvantaged children and families and to cutting red tape for families and childcare providers. This red tape impacts providers, families and governments to improve access to services for vulnerable children, so we must improve it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once amended, the bill will allow the period of time the provider can apply for an additional childcare subsidy determination to be extended from 13 weeks to up to 12 months for children under a long-term child protection order such as those in foster care. This is a welcome change that recognises the support that vulnerable children need over longer times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other amendments will enable providers to apply to backdate a family's additional childcare subsidy beyond the current limit of 28 days. This can be up to 13 weeks in exceptional circumstances. This will mean that providers can receive the additional subsidy for a foster child who is at risk of serious abuse or neglect while the foster family confirms its childcare subsidy eligibility. This will ensure these children have immediate and streamlined access to child care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Childcare providers will also be able to enrol children who are in foster care under the additional childcare subsidy for an initial period of up to 13 weeks. This gives an individual foster family enough time to lodge their childcare subsidy claim and have it assessed by Services Australia. Existing provisions where providers are required to notify Services Australia when a child is no longer considered to be at risk will continue to apply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When introducing this bill to the House of Representatives, Minister Tehan reaffirmed the government's commitment to improving access to child care for vulnerable and disadvantaged children and families. As I outlined earlier, the changes in this bill will streamline access to the additional childcare subsidy by cutting red tape for families and childcare providers. The changes will also further support vulnerable and disadvantaged families to access quality and affordable early learning and child care by enhancing a childcare provider's ability to provide early access to the additional subsidy to vulnerable and disadvantaged families where appropriate. Notably, the amendments continue to maintain appropriate safeguards to support the integrity of the payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is providing record funding for child care. We invested $8.6 billion in the 2019-20 financial year, with this budgeted to rise to $9.9 billion in 2022-23. We know how important these early years are and we are committed to the provision of quality affordable child care. The once-in-a-generation reforms we have introduced have delivered a 3.2 per cent reduction in out-of-pocket costs to parents. The new childcare package represents the most significant reforms to the early education and care system in 40 years. This package provides more access and more financial support for those who need it most. This is around one million Australian families. We are making it easier for these families to balance work and parental responsibilities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Drilling down into the figures, and as highlighted by earlier contributions to this debate, this package means around 72 per cent of families pay no more than $5 per hour in day care centres, with 24 per cent paying no more than $2 per hour. The childcare relief package introduced during the coronavirus pandemic kept 99 per cent of childcare centres open. This initial relief package did its job, and now we are operating within the $708 million transition package. This transition package, as I said earlier, was introduced in July to support the sector and families as they move back to the childcare subsidy. This package has several parts to ensure the recovery of the childcare sector, while also ensuring continuity for the families that need this service. The government will pay approximately $2 billion in childcare subsidy this quarter to eligible families. The subsidy is means-tested to ensure that those who earn the least receive the highest level of subsidy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the childcare subsidy, the government will pay childcare services a transition payment of 25 per cent of their fee revenue received during the relevant relief package reference fortnight, and the last two payments scheduled for September will be brought forward to help with the transition and cash flow. This additional transition payment of $708 million replaces JobKeeper for employees of a childcare subsidy approved service and for sole traders operating a childcare service, and it applies important conditions on childcare providers. For the period of the transition, childcare fees will be capped at the level of the reference period and services will need to guarantee employment levels to protect staff who have moved off the JobKeeper payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will also ease the activity tests until 4 October, to support eligible families whose employment has been impacted as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. These families will receive up to 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight during this period. This will assist families to return to the level of work, study or training they were undertaking before COVID-19. In addition, the gap in fees will be waived when childcare services are forced to close on public health advice as a result of COVID-19. This has been extended to 31 December.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian childcare sector will receive an additional $33 million in support. Melbourne's services will receive a higher transition payment of 30 per cent. They may also be eligible for a top-up where the childcare subsidy received is low and they are experiencing greatly reduced attendance. Victorian families will receive an extra 30 days allowable absences up to a total of 72 days. All services subject to stage 3 or higher restrictions can waive gap fees if children are not attending and absences are claimed, allowing enrolments to be maintained and the childcare subsidy to be paid. Outside hours school care services in Victoria will receive an additional viability support payment of 15 per cent of their revenue if attendances have fallen by 40 per cent. On average, the government expects that services in Melbourne will receive between 80 and 85 per cent of their pre-COVID revenue. The 25 per cent transition package will be applied to all providers to replace JobKeeper, which was not universally supportive across the entire sector. This package is designed to deliver a more equitable outcome across all early learning services providers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The support I have outlined here for vulnerable and disadvantaged families is just a small part of what this government has done to ensure Australians can receive financial help during this pandemic. This support also includes: the JobKeeper payment to help businesses and their employees; changes to JobSeeker eligibility and payments; the coronavirus supplement; pandemic leave disaster payments; and additional funding for a number of essential services helping vulnerable Australians during this pandemic, such as those experiencing family and domestic violence, those who need extra support for their mental health and those who are living with disability. There is so much this government has done to support Australians during these incredibly difficult times, especially vulnerable Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill demonstrates that the government remain committed to making life easier for childcare providers and vulnerable and disadvantaged families and that we are listening to providers so we can continue to make improvements based on that feedback around how the childcare package is operating. The changes proposed in this bill will reduce the regulatory and administrative burden on families and childcare providers. They will support vulnerable and disadvantaged families to access quality early learning and child care and help parents to access financial assistance. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281603" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MARIELLE SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  [by video link] I also rise to speak on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Improving Assistance for Vulnerable and Disadvantaged Families) Bill 2020. I'll state from the outset, as my colleagues have done, that Labor is supporting this bill because it makes a number of changes which will improve assistance to vulnerable and disadvantaged families. Fundamentally, they need help now more than ever and if this bill goes some way towards providing that help then it's something that we of course would support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the conversation can't be left there, because we know this bill doesn't go nearly far enough in supporting the vulnerable families who depend on our early childhood system, the educators within it and the system itself. Even prior to this pandemic, the early childhood sector in Australia was in crisis. Fees were soaring without any real way of getting them under control. There were serious issues with the rollout of the government's response, which we warned them about and which still manifested because, ultimately, the government don't get early childhood. They don't get child care. They don't get the sector. They don't value it in the way that they should. When it comes to early childhood, our expenditure in this area and the things we do are ultimately a choice about what we as a community value. We see time and time again from the government that they see this sector, that they see child care, as babysitting. They don't see it as early learning. Fundamentally, we have to see it as early learning, because that will drive the appropriate policy responses on cost, quality and access, especially for vulnerable families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know parents are paying too much for child care at the moment and that is a huge issue. It is an issue which the government needs to get control of. But I know that's difficult because in early childhood you're always balancing this question of cost and this question of quality and this question of access. It's a tricky conundrum. It's an expensive conundrum, but it's a conundrum worth trying to solve. It's a conundrum that we need to put our money and our minds towards if we really want to make a difference not only to the lives of children but to productivity in Australia. Ultimately, investing in early education is one of the best things we can do to grow our economy not just now but well into the future. We know that for every dollar spent on early learning in Australia we could generate $2 worth of benefits to our broader economy. That's a huge return on investment. We also know that child care is critical to women's participation in the workforce. The Grattan Institute has shown us that it's one of the best ways that we can enhance this participation and that could bring us a multibillion dollar impact on gross domestic product.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, these were the issues that surrounded this sector prior to the pandemic. The pandemic has come along and, in so many ways in our community and our country, it has just completely changed the way work operates and the way sectors like early childhood operate. The pandemic has had a devastating impact on our early childhood sector. The government was far too slow in responding to it. Our educators, who I talk to every day, were worried and scared early on that they were on the frontline of this crisis but no-one was really seeing that they were. They didn't have access to PPE. They didn't know where to get it. They didn't know how to run their centres, what to do and how to handle these changes. The package which came in to support them wasn't well thought through. It left some centres much worse off. It left families not able to access the care they needed. It left women who were returning from maternity leave and wanting to go back into jobs such as being ICU nurses unable to access a place in child care and therefore not going to work and fighting the pandemic. And the early-childhood educators who were raising these issues were never given that seat at the table that they needed so that the government could get on top of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The package saved a lot of centres, and we're grateful for the ones it helped. But then came the inexplicable decision to throw early-childhood educators—and only early-childhood educators—off JobKeeper. What does that say to these educators, who, through this pandemic, have been doing critical work and, let's face it, often risky work? It's very hard to socially distance from a toddler. I've got one; I know. It's not really possible. When a toddler needs their nose blown you've just got to get in there and do it. These guys were doing risky work, and they were the first ones—the only ones—thrown off JobKeeper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their anxiety has been sky high during this pandemic. And I get it. But he government doesn't; they never have. There is so much more we need to do for these early-childhood educators to see them through this pandemic, to give them the confidence they need that they'll have the PPE, that their centres can survive, that they can provide the care that the children need. And for vulnerable kids especially, we need to make sure we get this right. When this pandemic started and we saw parents having their children home from school—either by choice or by necessity, depending on the state they lived in—and we saw parents withdrawing their children from early-childhood education, because they too were worried about the implications for the health of their kids, one of my first fears, my first thought, was: 'What about those most vulnerable kids in early-childhood care?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that for too many children in Australia that interaction with their educators in early childhood, that attendance at child care, can make an enormous difference to their lives. It can be the difference between abuse being reported and not being. It can be the difference between knowing that a child is getting enough meals and enough nourishment or not. These early-childhood educators working with vulnerable children are saving lives and often they provide the only love and support a child gets. Often they're the only ones who do things like sit with a child and count their fingers and toes—critical things that so many of us take for granted. But if you don't count a child's fingers and toes out loud, if you don't have that early counting and language and interaction, then critical brain connections will not form and that child will not develop as a child should.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The work our early educators do is critical. It's critical for individual children and it's critical for our community. What happens to those vulnerable kids who left early-childhood care? What happens if they don't come back? What happens if they miss that critical part of their early learning? It will change their brain development. That is a lifelong implication for these kids, to be locked out of the early-childhood sector, even for weeks—and imagine if it's months, or even years. We can't afford that. Those kids can't afford that. Our country can't afford that. For these vulnerable children who, I acknowledge, this bill tries to help, there are much bigger challenges ahead, too. Until we get a handle on those, until we know we can ensure access, until we know that our early educators have the confidence to do their job, to be there for these kids and all kids, then we're failing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to do so much more in this space. I implore them to look at the research, look at the brain maps. You can actually hold up scans of brains and see those critical connections form. It is incredible, some of the most simple acts that we do as parents and that are repeated by early-childhood educators and built on. Their work is incredible, and they've been doing it so incredibly tough during the pandemic.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to thank them, not just the educators but also the administrators who are working in centres and trying desperately to balance the books to keep their centres thriving and continuing, because they know how important it is that children have continuity of care. They know how important the work they're doing is. They also know how important it is to keep their early educators in work, and secure and safe. To our administrators and our directors as well: I thank you, because it has been such an incredibly stressful time for all of you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During this pandemic our early childhood workers have been on the front line. They are also some of the workers in our community who have been the least valued historically in terms of their pay and conditions. So let this be a wake-up call for us. They are doing essential work and doing it at the toughest of times. Once we get through this pandemic, once we get through the critical questions we have to face to make sure our educators and the children they care for are okay, let's look at the workforce—let's look at wages and at actually valuing these educators for the critical role they play. They are changing lives and, more than that, they are changing our country and our future. Our productivity, our future prosperity in Australia, depends on our education system. And our education system does not start at school; it starts when a child first walks into an early learning centre. We have to make sure during this pandemic that we don't see any child walk out of their early learning centre and not return, because the consequences of that would be absolutely catastrophic. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I thank the Senate and, in particular, those senators who have spoken on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Improving Assistance for Vulnerable and Disadvantaged Families) Bill 2020. I acknowledge the contributions to the debate and the support for this legislation coming from across the chamber. I add my thanks to Australia's early childhood education and care providers and those who operate centres, the educators and carers across the sector in particular, who have gone above and beyond in providing, not just in this challenging year but every day in every year, valuable care to Australian children and advancing their education prospects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has focused throughout the COVID-19 crisis on ensuring that amongst the support provided to families we've made sure that the childcare sector has been available to vulnerable and disadvantaged children and families and those who need it most. Through the ECEC Relief Package, over 98 per cent of childcare providers were able to keep their doors open during the period of widespread national shutdown of other economic activities, providing free child care to the children of essential workers, to vulnerable children and to children whose families had an existing relationship with the service. This bill clearly shows that as we see, across most of the nation, the return to the demand-driven childcare subsidy on 13 July our government is committed to continuing to improve access to child care for vulnerable and disadvantaged children and families and to cutting red tape for both families and childcare providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the implementation of the government's world-leading childcare reforms that provided for much more affordable and much better targeted childcare access in Australia, it is clear that our government's goal of delivering a more affordable, accessible and flexible childcare subsidy system indeed has been delivered upon. But we've also been listening to stakeholders regarding areas of improvement. They were widespread reforms that we made to the system, and naturally with those widespread reforms there will continue to be small areas of refinement and improvement. The key measures contained in this bill are in direct response to feedback received from the childcare sector. These key measures will benefit families and childcare providers by extending and backdating the additional childcare subsidy child wellbeing certificates and determinations from 28 days to up to 13 weeks in exceptional circumstances; extending the period, from 13 weeks to up to 12 months, that additional determinations can be given for children on a long-term child protection order; and clarifying that a provider may be eligible for additional childcare subsidy in respect of certain defined classes of children, such as foster children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Notably, the amendments also continue to maintain appropriate safeguards to support the integrity of the additional childcare subsidy payment. Tragically, it's a fact that, historically, the childcare system has been open to activities of rorting and misappropriation of funds that are intended to support the wellbeing of children, the education of those children and access to care for parents and families. That's why we made sure that we had strong safeguards in our reforms, reforms that were intended to ensure that the children and families who needed care most received the greatest access to care and that those who needed financial support to pay for that care most received the greatest degree of financial support for the care that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill demonstrates that the government remains committed to making life easier for providers and for vulnerable and disadvantaged families, and that we continue to make improvements based on feedback about the childcare reforms and package that we implemented. The changes in this bill will reduce the regulatory and administrative burden on families and childcare providers, will support vulnerable and disadvantaged families to access quality early learning and child care, and will help families to access the financial assistance that they need. I commend the bill to the Senate and thank the Senate for its support of these reforms.</span>

It builds upon a bill introduced in the last parliament, which Labor also supported, which allowed people who used to work for the Commonwealth to continue using their Public Sector Superannuation Scheme accumulation plan, or PSSap, accounts for their super contributions. Labor understands that the bill before us today is being driven by feedback from members following the passage of the bill in the last parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would allow former PSSap members to use their PSSap accounts for contributions in respect of any employment—that is, employment that does not attract a superannuation guarantee obligation—and if they wish to make other contributions, such as non-concessional contributions. The bill would allow current PSSap members to use their PSSap accounts for contributions from non-Commonwealth employers who they're working for at the same time. It would also allow Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, or CSS and the PSS—the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme—members to establish a PSSap account for contributions from non-Commonwealth employers who they're working for at the same time. It will also allow CSS and PSS members who cease being members and become pensioners, in the superannuation sense, or take their lump-sum benefits to establish a PSSap account for contributions from non-Commonwealth employers or for other contributions, such as non-concessional contributions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, it would allow the CSS deferred benefit or PSS preserved benefit members to establish a PSSap account for contributions from non-Commonwealth employers or for other contributions, such as non-concessional contributions. We've been advised that around 10,000 individuals would utilise the new arrangements over the next three years. This consists of around 6,000 former PSSap members, 1,800 people ceasing to be CSS or PSS contributors in the next three years and 1,500 CSS deferred benefit or PSS preserved benefit members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are sensible changes to the legislative framework, which allow for the continued use of PSSap accounts, as well as allowing members of the old defined benefit scheme who want to use the PSSap system. While this is a sensible amendment to public sector superannuation, we also say that it's only Labor who will defend the $3 trillion superannuation system and ensure that Australians have a fuller, richer and dignified retirement.</span>

Those on the other side have opposed its formation and opposed increases to the rate of the superannuation guarantee, and now we have more and more of those opposite openly agitating for the currently legislated increase to the super guarantee to be abandoned in some or form or another. We even have the minister, Senator Hume, saying she's ambivalent on the issue of the increase for the superannuation guarantee. The Prime Minister, however, continues to confirm the government's election commitment that they took to the last election to stick to the currently legislated timetable. If he breaks his promise, this will be an attack on workers and their standard of living.</span>

The Prime Minister's lack of a plan for jobs and recovery has forced people to apply for nearly $33 billion of their own superannuation savings, with nearly $32 billion of that already paid out through the government's early access to super scheme. It's pretty ironic for the party that has opposed the concept of compulsory superannuation all the way that one of the largest economic measures that's contributing to stimulating the economy at this time is people accessing funds out of super. If it weren't for compulsory superannuation, this money wouldn't even exist. There have been 3.1 million applications made, 1.2 million repeat—</span>

Analysis has shown that young Australians will be more than $44 billion worse off at retirement because of the removal of their money from their superannuation accounts.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RENNICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  I rise today in support of the Superannuation Amendment (PSSAP Membership) Bill 2020. There is no subject that better reflects the difference in philosophy between this side of the chamber and that side of the chamber. Why? This side of the chamber believes in free choice and individual responsibility. It believes in liberty. Give me liberty or death, as the great American patriot Patrick Henry said in his speech that helped trigger the American Revolution, a revolution that has echoed across the centuries and across the world, a revolution that has empowered the individual to make their own choices about how they live their lives, a revolution that overthrew the yoke of oppression, a revolution that continues today as we fight the forces of Marxism and communism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So many of those forces sit opposite us today, all with their little red books, bobbing their heads to every command issued by their Big Brother: industry super funds run by unions. They sit there so smugly on the other side of the chamber, secretly plotting new ways by which they can impose more command and control over everyday Australians. Of course, there is no greater example of command and control than superannuation. How so, you might ask? By stealth and deception. That's how. By undermining the democratic right of working Australians by not ever seeking a mandate to take 12 per cent of people's hard-earned income every week and give it to unelected, unaccountable fund managers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Left love to praise New Zealand, saying what a great country it is, because they've got a leftie in power. Let's give praise where praise is due. In 1996 New Zealand had a vote on compulsory superannuation. Do you know what the result was? They voted it down: 92 per cent to eight. Did Paul Keating ever ask the Australian public if they wanted money taken out of their pockets, to be given to someone that the worker would never meet, until they were 60—with, I might add, no guarantee of ever getting their capital back?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to contrast the actions of the Labor Party and the unions with those of the Liberal Party with their belief in free choice. The original liberal philosophers Locke, Bacon and Rousseau sought to replace the norms of hereditary privilege, absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings with representative democracy and property rights. I want to repeat this: there was never anything democratic about superannuation. Keating, in his typically arrogant manner, rammed it through parliament without ever seeking a mandate or holding a referendum, no doubt because he knew that it would never get up if the people were given a choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely the federal government has an obligation under section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, which provides that the Commonwealth has the power to make laws with respect to 'the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws', to protect the initial capital put into super funds. It is my view that compulsory superannuation is unconstitutional if it doesn't return the initial superannuation that was contributed to the super fund. Let me add, it's only a matter of time before this gets tested in the High Court. If superannuation isn't voluntary, then superannuation funds, including industry funds, should be forced to make up losses—in keeping with the Constitution—if the initial capital isn't returned. People have a right to expect their property rights to be respected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about how much superannuation is costing us: $40 billion in tax concessions. The cost of these tax concessions is growing much faster than the cost of the pension. It's estimated that the cost of superannuation and the tax concessions will soon be greater. Who do these tax concessions go to? Mainly the wealthy. Don't get me wrong. People work hard and they're entitled to keep as much money as possible, but I fail to see why low-income earners should pay a higher rate of tax on their income than the wealthy pay on their superannuation income. Where is the Labor Party in this? I thought the Labor Party and the unions were the champions of the poor and oppressed. No—not when it jeopardises the rivers of gold that flow into the superannuation funds that then flow into the Labor Party's coffers. Then there's the $40 billion in fees that it costs to run superannuation. To put that into context, that's more than the cost of defence. Most of these fees go to white-collared blowhards in Sydney and Melbourne. Every week, rivers of gold flow out of regional communities, communities that desperately need to retain every dollar they earn. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm happy to put up a motion with the Labor Party that, if we make superannuation voluntary, I will put the first $4 billion in tax concessions that we save into aged care. We can take some tax from the wealthy Australians and put it into aged care, if you want to make it voluntary. Let's see if you're up for that one. It only costs around $6 billion to manage the pension. Why does it cost $40 billion to manage super? It's time to stop the rorting. And there's more: $600 billion of superannuation is invested offshore, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when Australia desperately needs infrastructure and development. What is industry super doing? Where were they when the Northern Territory government sold the Darwin Port? Where were they? Where was the CFMMEU? I've looked at the maritime union super funds, and they invest offshore. Why didn't they buy the Darwin Port? Why didn't they take an equity in their own livelihood? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget the rorts. Entertainment budgets don't comply with the sole purpose test, but has that stopped Hostplus from spending thousands of dollars in wining and dining at the Australian Open? Or the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Daily</span>—a Communist propaganda tool used to peddle Marxist ideology—</span>

                    </a>  For this great cost, is super actually doing what it is supposed to do by reducing the number of people on the pension? Hardly. The number of people retiring with a mortgage since superannuation was introduced has increased from 40 per cent to 70 per cent. That's right. When they retire, more people are now enslaved to the banks than they were when superannuation was introduced. It's just a win-win for the finance industry. They're bleeding interest out of workers as they save throughout their lives, and on the other hand they're bleeding fees out of superannuation funds—they're double-clipping the ticket. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And for what? So much for people having a better retirement with super—what better form of retirement is there than owning your own house? That's right: superannuation is actually counterproductive. It's not doing what it's supposed to do. For all of this expense, the number of people on the pension has actually only fallen from 74 per cent to 68 per cent. It's not even saving that much in the pension. Some estimates put it at about $9 billion, which is hardly what you'd call productive, given that it takes about $80 billion in fees and tax concessions. It's counterproductive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also point out that the pension, unlike superannuation, is universal. Everyone is entitled to it. That's not the case for superannuation. The unemployed, the disabled and the stay-at-home parents—they don't get superannuation. Shouldn't good government policy lift all boats, regardless of the choice you make and regardless of the circumstances you find yourselves in? Where is the equality? Well, let me tell you. When it comes to superannuation, there is no equality: only repression, rorts and pork-barrelling from left-wing vested interests. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you think Labor and the unions will ever stop asking for superannuation increases? Of course not. Why do we know that? Because at the last sitting of the parliament they refused to vote on a motion that would reduce union fees throughout COVID. Never get between the Labor Party and their rivers of gold from the unions! And who runs the industry funds? It's Greg Combet, a union hack and, even more worryingly, the former environment minister that allowed the Bureau of Meteorology to keep two sets of books.</span>

                    </a>  Yes, I'll take that interjection. Do you want someone that condoned a public service department running two sets of books, running hundreds of billions of dollars in superannuation? Is he going to run two sets of books and then suddenly find their liquid assets can't be sold for the value they've stated in the books? Yes. I can just imagine the smoke and mirrors the superannuation funds would come up with then, telling everyone it's all fine.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Has superannuation ever built anything? Of course not. That would require fund managers to get off their backsides and learn how to build things. They'd have to be engineers or get out in the hot sun and start sweating. That's not what superannuation funds do, is it? But I'll tell you what they do do. They buy infrastructure. Do you know what infrastructure they bought? It was all those assets that have been privatised—things like CBA and CSL, and in my home state of Queensland the Bligh-Beattie government sold our railways, ports, airports, forestry plantations and lotteries to name a few.</span>

That's right, ladies and gentleman: Senator Watt was their advisor. Now she just happens to work for the Australian Bankers Association. Don't let your morals or values get in the way of a big fat pay cheque! And who did they sell to? They sold to super funds, many of which were industry funds. And why did they do this? They did it so that the Marxists in the union movement can gain control over our industries and destroy the true means of production in this country: small business. Greg Combet is on record saying that he's going to have influence in the boardrooms. Do we really want these unelected representatives in the boardroom looking after union interests and not shareholder interests? This is a concern, let me tell you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party hates small business, and do you know why? It's because small businesses stand on their own two feet. They distrust all governments, and they, of course, are the lifeblood and breeding ground of the patriot, the sworn enemy of those Marxists who sit on the other side. As I stand here today, let me tell you: I will never stop fighting for the patriots. That is what this side of the chamber is all about—standing up for those who stand up for themselves, those who believe in free choice, those who believe in liberty, those who believe in family, not those opposite who want to believe in command and control, in big governments, in high taxes, in the repression of free will and in the complete and utter destruction of everything that makes this country great. Let me tell you: as a proud Australian, the blood of the patriot runs deep within me. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  What an enervating experience it is listening to Senator Rennick, a sort of out-of-body experience really. Over there is the team 'The Thought Leaders'. I won't include Senator Scarr in this because he's far too sensible, but on superannuation Rennick and Bragg are the thought leaders of the conservative show. I have a little bit to say about Senator Bragg in a moment, but when I listen to a stream of consciousness word-salad about little red books, Big Brother, bankers, Marxists, command and control, it feels like I'm at a sort of QAnon cell meeting, not the Australian Senate, not where adults engage in this stuff. After these sorts of claims about the Constitution, next thing we'll be hearing about sovereign citizens. It is not really clear to me what Senator Rennick opposes in terms of industry superannuation funds. Does he oppose the big returns? Does he oppose the low fees? It's unclear to me. The super system was built by Australians working together. Employers and unions built the compulsory superannuation scheme. Millions of Australians who otherwise would have been impoverished in their retirement are living a decent, secure retirement that their parents could only have dreamt of.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The role of super in the stimulus response is worth examination. It is worth, you would think, some deep reflection on that side of the Senate. What's really happened is the government has robbed future retirees of their savings in order to do the work that the government should have done. Many, many people have filled the gap. They have filled the gap in the government's failures with retirement savings. People will be impoverished in the future. If the Morrison government is presented with a pathway that's easy, if they are presented with a pathway that hurts the people they imagine to be their ideological opponents, if they are presented with a pathway that helps their big business mates and if they're presented with a pathway that leaves ordinary Australians out, you can bet they'll always take it—and they have.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some big economic issues in front of the parliament this year. This government was dragged kicking and screaming to reach the conclusion that there should be a wage subsidy package out there in the JobKeeper package. I remember watching the bloke who represents the Prime Minister in here, Senator Cormann, bitterly opposing a wage subsidy package. What Mr Frydenberg said a few weeks ago is true: the cold, desiccated spirit of Maggie Thatcher and Ronald Reagan still animates these characters over here today. This JobKeeper program is administratively complex and leaves out millions of Australians. Beyond that was a plan for a snapback, which has now turned to a taper off. They have no plan for jobs beyond the taper off.</span>

                    </a>  It should be a source of strength, but these guys can't wait to wreck it. Their MO from the minister to Senators Bragg and Rennick, the thought leaders over there, is to attack it and then retreat and say, 'We're just trying to help.' If it was up to the Liberals, super wouldn't exist for most Australians. It would be the preserve of the very wealthy. It would be the preserve of the elite. It would be the preserve of big business. They opposed its formation. They opposed every single increase in the superannuation guarantee and the contribution rate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened when the pandemic hit and the economy was faced with the prospect of millions of people losing their jobs is that most Australians saw a crisis. These guys saw an opportunity. Most Australians reacted in horror to the prospect of losing jobs. Most Australians reacted in horror to the loss of gross national product. But these guys saw an opportunity. In JobKeeper, $35 billion has been spent so far. Through the early access scheme, almost $32 billion has been stripped out of low-income Australians' super funds—600,000 ordinary, low-income, low-balance account holders have emptied their accounts in total. I don't begrudge any of them. The criticism is of you lot. Those individuals knew they couldn't rely on Scott Morrison. They had to go to their own low-balance accounts and strip them out because they—casual workers, low-income workers and women—knew they couldn't rely on this government. Twenty-five-year-olds will be $80,000 to $100,000 worse off because of your policy framework and because you couldn't deliver. The government couldn't deliver.</span>

                    </a>  The government are now laying the groundwork for their failure to deliver on their legislated increases in the superannuation guarantee. That would represent a real wage cut for most Australians. This idea that there is some contest between wages and superannuation is the silliest proposition. It's the most transparently silly proposition. It's not real. For most people, their wage increases are set out for them in the award system. Their wage increases are set out for them for the next 12 months. For people who are in collective agreements, their outcomes are set out for them. In a period of record-low wage growth over the last three years, presided over by what passes for the economic team over there, the idea that you would also cut people's hope of a decent retirement position should horrify most Australians. What passes for what he calls 'philosophical convictions' in Senator Rennick's mind is a deep conviction of hostility to ordinary Australians doing better for themselves than the government allows. They are for cold charity and the government determining who gets up. We are for Australians working together to do better.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been horrified by what Senator Bragg, the self-styled expert over there on industry superannuation, has had to say about this. Just seven days ago, in a tweet, which is his preferred mode of communication, beyond books, with the Australian people, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and the next part is in quotation marks, so he's indicating the former Prime Minister said this—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Except Paul Keating never said that. He never said that. And there was no ACTU Congress in 1992. Senator Bragg said that Paul Keating said that at a 1992 ACTU congress. But he didn't. When one tells a lie, it needs details to be credible, but it's also really important that the details aren't so easily verifiable, because the important thing about telling a lie is that people don't figure you out so quickly. Senator Bragg has a history of making wild—it's hard to say 'wild' in the presence of Senator Rennick—untrue claims to further his argument. I'm not sure whether it's attention-seeking behaviour—I'm not talking about you, Senator Rennick—or because the ideas themselves are running out of puff, or whether it's just compulsive.</span>

The truth is, if you review the AEC records—and the super industry organisations have done this—they show $25,000 worth of donations as far back as records go. The super industry bodies wrote to Senator Bragg and told him all about this in a completely verifiable way, but he's chosen to ignore that. Just for scale, or perspective, that's about three-hundredths of a per cent of what Clive Palmer spent supporting your re-election bid last year.

                    </a>  Why does Senator Bragg continue to say the things that he says? Why does he continue to say things that are demonstrably not true? Why is he so committed to the path that he has embarked upon of deliberately saying things about industry superannuation that are not true and distorting the facts? Last week he claimed that contributions to super have been lifting house prices. I imagine he'll shortly be saying that they cause climate change or are responsible for the Broncos' performance this year. Senator Rennick and Senator Scarr might take some comfort in that. He might say that it's responsible for the drought. Every claim that he makes shouldn't be taken seriously in this debate, because he resorts so easily to making assertions that are not true. Ultimately, one loses credibility if one keeps making wild and extravagant claims—something that you, Senator Rennick, might pay some attention to. Let's make this debate about the interests of ordinary Australians, not the ideological predilections of the far recesses of the Queensland LNP.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="256063" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  I rise to address the Superannuation Amendment (PSSAP Membership) Bill 2020. Superannuation is actually a good idea, but it has been poorly executed. What I mean by 'poorly executed' is that its very birth was, frankly, a chaotic birth, because who can think of any other fundamentally intergenerational scheme that hasn't even got a framework or an objective?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two schools of thought as to how this scheme came to life. The first school of thought is that it was developed by Bill Kelty and Iain Ross, who were staffers at the ACTU in the late eighties and early nineties. They advised the Keating government on formalising the accord arrangements on superannuation into legislation. The other school of thought is that the Treasury was asked to do some basic modelling at a pub in Canberra, on the back of a coaster, which was, sadly, thrown out and lost to history. Either way, the scheme was not put in place with the sort of economic rigour with which it should have been born so that over time it would actually be effective. By 'effective' I mean that what this scheme should be doing is getting people off the pension and saving the government and the taxpayer money. It is a demonstrable failure because it costs the budget vastly more than it saves and it gets very, very few people off the pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing it does, which is a very real issue for a lot of low-income Australians, is damage people's prospects of securing a first home. Now, many factors have led to the lack of home affordability in Australia. I should take this opportunity to correct the record. I have not said that superannuation has increased the cost of housing ever. What I have said is that, if you are a low-income earner and you are forced to save into a superannuation scheme, it is harder, by definition, to secure a deposit for a first home. This is real money. These trade-offs are real. You can have a debate about the superannuation guarantee rate; the money doesn't fall out of the sky. The money, which is a cost of employment, is part of workers' wages. So your super guarantee increase is a trade-off against a wage increase, just as it is a trade-off against any other financial judgement, like pulling together a deposit for a first home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important issue for legislators to consider carefully. It is one of the biggest things that we do to the Australian people. We compel people to put almost 10 per cent of their own wages and salaries off away into these opaque funds, and we hope for the best, effectively. It is a lightly regulated industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People have said that I'm a socialist. People who know me know that that is not true, but I have advocated a higher level of regulation in this space because the way that this scheme was set up by the Keating government is that it was gifted to the financial institutions and the unions to run and they have run it poorly. You can look at the behaviour of the industry funds during this COVID crisis, when they have put their interests ahead of the national interest every single day—shocking, disgusting rent-seeking. You can see the even more appalling behaviour of the retail funds, who were exposed by the royal commission as always putting the shareholders ahead of the members and therefore breaching their fiduciary duty. This is a disgustingly administered scheme. Why is it so poorly administered? Because of the money. Each and every year, $32 billion in fees is sucked out of people's accounts. Australians spend more on super fees than they do on power bills. The only response we ever hear from the other side is effectively that there should be more and more super, more and more super, more and more super. There is not enough focus on the outcomes of the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the course of its 30 years, it has failed, really, on three fronts. As I said, it costs more than it saves. This year alone we're looking at almost $40 billion in forgone tax revenue. The industry says, 'We've probably saved the budget about $9 billion.' I know that you can't net those figures off, but you're a long way behind. Secondly, pension reliance is stubbornly high. Seventy per cent of people are on the pension today, and that will be the same in 2050. Yes, there will be more part-pensioners, but who can think of a scheme that after 50 years and 70 years of operation is getting virtually no-one off the pension? Thirdly—and this is a real issue for many lower income Australians—it is damaging the prospects of people pulling together a deposit for a first home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The vested interests here are very, very strong. As I said, it was gifted to the banks and the unions, and the problem with the characterisation of the debate around unions and industry funds is that it's not just the unions that are the guilty parties; it's also the large employers. The large employer groups and the unions have been in bed together for the whole time that super has been in existence, and they will always put their own narrow interests ahead of the workers, just like they do on penalty rates. Just as they will cut workers' penalties rates to feather their own nests, they will always advocate for more and more super because of the board positions and associated revenues which flow into the employer groups and the unions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ayres said that I have been making misleading statements about the Australian Electoral Commission data on payments to unions. The fact is that in this calendar year $13 million will flow from super funds into unions. That is not my data; that is the Electoral Commission's data. I have projected, based on a nine per cent growth rate over the past 10 years, that it will hit about $31 million by the end of this decade. By 2030 there will be $31 million flowing from super funds into unions. That is a significant amount of money. As someone who spent some time as a party director, I can assure this chamber that $31 million will pay for a lot of campaigns. And this is only the money that is captured under the AEC's definition of a political payment. It doesn't include the enormous expenditure, through advertising and other means, of the funds on promoting themselves. You can turn on the TV and watch a footy game, and all you'll see is super fund ads: 'How good is super?' 'Fantastic. It must be a great deal.' So the vested interests are a real problem. As I said, the financial institutions are just as bad. They have had their colours lowered by the banking royal commission; too often they have put their own interests ahead of the workers. But who could blame them? This is the only industry in Australia where they open the door and the money just piles in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party are isolated on the question of the superannuation guarantee. The ACOSS advocates for those on low incomes, the independent economists at Grattan and CIS, the Treasury, the Governor of the Reserve Bank—everyone has said this is a bad time to raise the super guarantee. It's a bad time because it will cost workers a wage increase, it will cost people jobs and, by the way, the system doesn't work very well. So, they're all saying, 'Why would you plough more money into this system?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party often likes to lecture us about being the advocates of low-income workers. Well, they're very isolated. ACOSS were against it. In fact, ACOSS were against the scheme at the beginning. And Peter Walsh, a decorated and very capable finance minister in the Hawke government, said that the only reason the scheme is being established by the government is to help the unions, because they want to get their toe into super funds management. That has been a cost-ineffective investment for workers, but it has worked really well for the unions. That's why all the people in this place fall over themselves to defend super. I wonder how many preselections depend on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, I am not an advocate for this system's abolition. I think that as a fair-minded person you have to look at the idea of trying to support people to be self-funded in retirement as a good objective and as a good and sound idea. So I would be an advocate for fixing the scheme rather than junking it. I think that it should have an objective and that there should be a clear framework. People should know that this system exists to get people off the pension. We should try to get at least half the population off the pension because we have an ageing population and that will cost the country significantly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also look, as a first order, at trying to cut fees. Seriously, if you're looking at $32 billion being sucked out of this scheme every year, when you're putting in about $100 billion, that's a pretty material amount of money that's being pulled out, effectively, to pay for this largesse that you see in the finance sector and in the union movement. So it would be quite a reasonable idea for there to be significant market intervention here. I see no reason why the government couldn't offer a simple, cheap and cheerful government default fund. That was in fact the recommendation of reviews in the 1970s that looked at the idea of having a superannuation scheme, but, when the Keating government got around to legislating superannuation, they of course gave it to their friends in the union movement and the finance sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also my view that historically—because I try to be a balanced person—the finance sector has had too much influence over the Liberal Party. I think there is no doubt that, particularly in the financial planning space, there has been too much influence, and people have not come to these issues and looked at them clearly. You would struggle to find a single member of the Labor caucus who would argue against having 12 per cent super, even though that would be argued in the face of all the independent evidence—from Grattan, from the Reserve Bank, from ACOSS. Every fair-minded private sector economist would say it was a bad idea. But there they are, apparently arguing against their own core constituency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we should try to do is actually enforce the laws this parliament sets. Why on earth would super have a sole purpose test designed to ensure that the money is managed only for members' benefits? It would be totally undermined, particularly by the regulator APRA—and I have to say, I've lost the great confidence in them that I had for many years. APRA is basically green-lighting super funds and allowing them to make significant political payments. They're also allowing the super funds to break their own prudential rules. There are people who have been on these boards for 10, 20 or 30 years. APRA has a board renewal policy that says you're not supposed to be on a super fund board for more than 12 years. There are people sitting on superannuation fund boards today who have been on these boards for 26 or 27 years. Until last year, there were two directors of super fund boards who had been on these boards for 32 years apiece. Now, 32 years is the age of the newest director of Telstra, Bridget Loudon. That's a good comparison.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day we will always try to look at these issues relating to superannuation in a practical way, because we are practical people on this side of the chamber. We will look at the super guarantee rate. We will look at system design. We will always try to get the best deal for workers, because we recognise that this is a significant intervention into people's private affairs. We want the scheme to work, and we'll look at it with clear eyes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reflect on this very good quote from the House of Representatives on Tuesday, where the Prime Minister said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Those opposite want to keep the hard-earned savings of Australians away from them when they need it most and have them tucked up in the industry fund by union fund managers as they count their directors fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem here is that the Labor Party really have no idea who they represent when they come into these chambers. Are they representing the super funds, or the unions, or the people who elected them? I really wish they would come into these chambers and reflect upon that very carefully. People can talk about people's past, their histories and what their prior views were—that's fine. But when you're elected into this place you really should look at every issue through the prism of what's going to be best for the workers, especially now that we're in an environment in which we have not been previously with super: this is the first recession we've had with super. So for people to come in here and advocate to send more and more money off to the banks and the union so they can count their big directors fees and make their significant payments to shareholders in a scheme which is not working is I think a very, very significantly bad judgement, and people will remember this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the Labor Party think that the super funds will come and campaign for them, that they'll threaten the crossbench and do all this stuff—that they'll use all the bullyboy tactics they have used in years gone by. That might be okay, but I think the Australian people will judge very harshly political parties which are desperate to put vested interests ahead of the national interest and vested interests ahead of their own interests. At the moment, the Australian people want more jobs, higher wages and a secure future. They don't want to see people coming into this place and trying to feather the nests of their mates.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  It gives me great delight to speak on the Superannuation Amendment (PSSAP Membership) Bill 2020 and to follow someone who has recently been referred to as a 'baby faced Liberal', Senator Bragg. Of course, our ex-Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul Keating, made a somewhat gratuitous comment, which was totally in keeping with his history and character, referring to 'baby faced Liberals'. I think he said something along the lines—and I'm happy to be corrected if I'm wrong in this regard—that 'It was, perhaps, the highest form of political modesty to be a first-term backbench senator.' Well, I'm happy to be in the company of these baby faced Liberals, although I must say that I don't think Senator Rennick qualifies in that regard! Perhaps on one hand we have baby faced Liberals here—a former political modesty—but on the other hand we have a cranky ex-PM who perhaps has unrivalled arrogance. I'll leave it there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Gallagher referred to the government attacking the superannuation system. It is somewhat odd for Senator Gallagher to make that remark, having gone through, in quite fair and reasonable fashion, what a benefit this bill will be to the members of the relevant funds. On the one hand she said that this bill is for the benefit of the members in relation to those funds, and then she accused the government of attacking the superannuation system. It's totally inconsistent. This bill promotes choice, flexibility and efficiency—choice, flexibility and efficiency—and that is what we should be seeking to do in relation to our superannuation scheme.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SCARR:</span>
                    </a>  I will just say to Senator Gallagher, and to Senator Ayres, that from our perspective the reforms which were introduced to allow members to withdraw $10,000 prior to 30 June and then a further $10,000 after 30 June were a matter of personal choice—personal choice in the circumstances of a pandemic. What it underlined to those members who did exercise that choice—and it wasn't the government exercising the choice—was that it was the government giving those members that choice to decide whether or not to withdraw that $10,000. It was the members who were given the choice, and that emphasised that it is the members' money. The money in those superannuation accounts is the members' money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before we had superannuation, prior generations used to put away a nest egg or they used to put away some money for hard times in a bank account. And when the hard times arrived they would draw down on that money. Why should people be deprived of that choice today in the middle of a pandemic? This government has given them choice and I'm proud to be part of a government that has delivered that choice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a real beauty about a Freudian slip. Senator Ayres gave us the best Freudian slip I've heard for a long time. He referred to the 'revenue' from superannuation—'revenue' was the word he used. Whose revenue is it? The union's revenue? I think that's the revenue he's referring to. He finds it difficult to take off his AMWU hat. I understand that. He was a very effective leader in trade union organisations and I respect him for that. But this is the whole point. Superannuation should not be about the revenue of the trade union movement. It should be about the members and their retirement. It's not a revenue source for third parties—and I don't care who they are. It should be for the benefit of the members, and the members should have a choice, in the time of a pandemic, whether or not they want to draw on some of those funds and make a decision—their own decision—with respect to how they want to apply those funds. They might want to pay off a home mortgage, taking some of the financial pressure off them today. I respect each and every person who has made that choice. That choice is certainly something we should be promoting in this place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ayres also asked Senator Rennick: 'Well, what do you oppose?' I thought it was quite clear, listening to Senator Rennick, as to what he opposed. He opposed industry super funds making political donations, or any super fund making a political donation. He opposes that because it is against the sole-purpose test. I oppose that as well. He opposes superannuation funds having exorbitant entertainment budgets. Why? Because it's against the sole-purpose test. It's not consistent with the sole-purpose test. I oppose that as well. And I do this not on an ideological basis. I'm actually a member of an industry fund. I'm a member of AustralianSuper. I congratulate Ian Silk and his team on the returns he has given me over a number of years. I left an AMP super fund because I wasn't happy with the returns in that respect and joined AustralianSuper, on the recommendation of my father, in fact—one of many recommendations he has made to me that I have followed, dutifully, as his son. I've been very happy with the performance of my industry super fund. I am unhappy when they defer in any way from that sole-purpose test. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about choice. It's about flexibility. It's about protecting the integrity of Australians' retirement savings and I commend it to the Senate. </span>

The Superannuation Amendment (PSSAP Membership) Bill 2020 extends membership of the Public Sector Superannuation accumulation plan to certain current and former Commonwealth employees who are not otherwise eligible to continue making contributions to a fund run by the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation. The bill will ensure the choice-of-fund principle extends appropriately to Commonwealth public sector schemes. It allows current and former PSSap members to avoid paying multiple fees to maintain separate funds under different trustees. This bill will support them in saving for their retirement.</span>

PSSap contributory members will also be able to make contributions to their account in respect of any non-Commonwealth employment that they undertake concurrent to their Commonwealth employment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because the interim Commissioner (as announced February 5 2020) has yet to be appointed, the interim Commissioner's literature review, also announced in February, is also yet to commence. This review, consisting of a comprehensive review of known current and former ADF and Defence personnel suicides since 2001, as well as a progress update on the implementation of recommendations made in various reviews and reports since 2003, should be concluded to inform the design of the National commissioner's proposed functioning.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The expectation offered by the Government in February 2020 was that the interim Commissioner would produce an initial report back twelve months from commencement, with a final report due 18 months from commencement (or six months after the initial reporting date). As this has been delayed, it is reasonable to suggest that the work of the interim Commissioner should inform the consideration of the Senate committee, and such that the work of the interim Commissioner should be allowed to proceed without delay, and without undue haste. The 12-month timeline to produce an initial report should be honoured.</span>

This is absolutely essential if we are to have proper scrutiny of these laws. They've just been tabled in the House of Representatives, and they are a full-blown attack on Australia's environment and on our wildlife. This bill is effectively a carbon copy of the legislation tabled by Tony Abbott in 2014, when Tony Abbott was doing the bidding of big miners and big developers to strip environmental protections and to allow these big companies to have free rein over Australia's natural wonderlands, our precious beaches, our precious forests and the homes of our native animals.

Back in May the Prime Minister stood up and crowed about how he was going to take a chainsaw to Australia's environment and how he was going to make it easier for big companies to get the green light for approvals. We've known for months that this legislation was coming up. Today it's been tabled and it's worse than we thought. It is a full-blown attack on our environment. So, in this place we need to make sure we send it off to the committee to look at it properly, to ensure there is scrutiny and to look at the flaws in this legislation.</span>

We've known for months that this was coming. It's been tabled today and it should go off to a Senate inquiry. I'm extremely concerned that Labor is indicating that they wouldn't support sending this legislation off to an inquiry. Why on earth not? Whose side is Labor on? Are you on the side of the environment or are you on the side of Tony Abbott and the big polluters? Whose side are you on? Unless we send this legislation off to an inquiry today, this government is going to try and ram this legislation through the parliament as quickly as possible.</span>

That does a number of things. It allows people to properly consider it, but it also allows us to engage the community. That includes businesses and environmentalists, and it includes people who are interested in the topic and may not fit into either of those categories. In my time in this chamber, I've seen committees work really well together to actually come up with, in many cases, better legislation. I think the fact that this is not being referred is a breach of proper process, and I've asked the government to reconsider their position on it. If I understand correctly, they are not supporting a referral. I think that is an unfortunate departure from what is good legislative process.</span>

The Senate has a very important role to play in scrutiny of legislation. There is absolutely no reason that I can fathom that the government can put before this place to explain why they wouldn't accept a referral. Perhaps we can have a discussion about the dates of referral, if that's the issue, but to have no referral on legislation this significant and this important seems like the government wanting to hide as much information as it can from the Senate before the Senate's in a position to debate this bill. It's an abuse of this Senate's role.</span>

Work with us. Let's have an inquiry. Let's discuss the dates for that inquiry, if that's your problem, but don't deny the Senate the right to scrutinise, through our committee process, this important piece of legislation.</span>

It will accelerate the generational threat of their chance to have lives with the same levels of hope and opportunity that we have all had the chance to live. It will accelerate the death and displacement of billions of people during this century, and of course, as always, it is the people living in the deepest poverty who will pay the harshest price. They will pay in their droves with their lives, because this government is a corporatist government. It is part of a corporatist kleptocracy which is stealing the futures of so many of our families and so many future generations in this country. It is corporate profit and greed that is driving this destruction, which this government continues to enable time after time by moving amending legislation like this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time we stood up and said enough. It's time we understood that we all rely on nature for our very survival and our very existence and that, in fact, we are part of nature. And you know what? You're all going to realise one day that we're part of nature, because nature is fighting back, and we are bearing the brunt of that in this country, with the bushfires, with the floods and with all of the other climate driven crises that are actually killing our people in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will of course fight this legislation all the way because it's bad legislation that fails to reflect fundamental realities about how nature works and how we, as humans, are part of the planetary ecosystem that ultimately we all rely on for our survival. Of course, we're happy and open to negotiate on the reporting date contained in Senator Hanson-Young's amendment. But, given that we have an obvious rationale for wanting to ensure that this legislation is not rushed through this place and given that the government at least occasionally pays lip service to the concept of listening to people, listening to communities and consulting with them, we urge the government to support our amendment and allow that listening process and that consultation to take place through the auspices of a Senate inquiry.</span>

Whether there's another inquiry or no inquiry, the Greens are going to fight this legislation all the way. An inquiry will make no difference. It is just another step—and this is what this is all about—in delaying and delaying. Senator Hanson-Young said that this legislation is a carbon copy of a piece of legislation that was introduced by the Abbott government. That is how long this has been inquired into by the Senate. This is how long the Greens have been fighting to delay this in going ahead. It's a carbon copy of a bill that was previously inquired into by a Senate committee.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you want to have another committee into a carbon copy of a bill into which there has already been an inquiry. You have just exposed the absolute insincerity with which you are seeking to pursue this amendment. I can see how you're smiling and smirking, because you know that what I'm saying is true. This is not about scrutiny. This is not about assessing a piece of legislation. This is about delaying, pure and simple, fighting it all the way and making sure that here in Australia we can't secure passage of a piece of legislation that is designed to appropriately balance environmental protection with economic opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to continue to grow our economy. We want to create opportunities for Australians to get ahead, to get a job and to pursue a career. That is why we've always got to make sure we appropriately balance environmental protection with economic opportunity. That is why we need to ensure that we streamline and make the environmental approval processes more efficient. We completely reject the proposition that we're avoiding scrutiny. But we are not going to be part of a charade whose sole objective, as Senator McKim has confirmed on the record in this chamber today, is to fight this legislation all the way. He's going to fight it on the beaches—</span>

                    </a>  He's agreeing. So why would we waste our time with an inquiry that has absolutely no prospect of changing the Greens' minds? They're not going into this with an open mind. They're going into this with a very clear determination to kill the bill. I have to say that I am deeply disappointed that the Labor Party yet again have made themselves complicit in Greens' efforts to kill a bill that is designed to promote economic opportunity in a way that is environmentally responsible. We are proposing to work with the state Labor government in Western Australia. The state Labor government in Western Australia wants to work with us in order to get projects up in an environmentally responsible fashion. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are always up for proper inquiries into new reforms that are coming forward, but we believe that six years of debate, six years of inquiries and six years of fighting this out is long enough. It is time to get on with it. It is time for the Senate to get on with it. We call on all senators who care about economic opportunity, who care about jobs for working Australians, to vote with us to reject this amendment to this Scrutiny of Bills Committee report.</span>

This is about economic opportunity and economic development, not environmental protection. Senator Cormann, the name of the bill is 'environmental protection'. That's what it's supposed to be doing—not economic development. You've got lots of other bills to do that. The government's agenda is really clear here, folks. They've just introduced amendments to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to—guess what?—designate gas a low-emission fuel. What is that? There's no way it is. It's a fossil fuel. Your gas-led recovery is so plain. You're prepared to trash the environment for the future to make sure that climate change runs rampant across this globe. That's what this is about.</span>

Maybe when you're amending it you should amend it to the 'trash the environment bill', because that's what you are doing with this. You are trashing our environment laws. You have already overseen so much destruction: further loss of species, further threatening of species. You'll do anything you can to facilitate development no matter the cost to our precious environment, to our precious species. Your agenda is so patently clear, particularly on the same day as you're introducing this bill that makes a mockery of addressing climate change and emissions in this country.</span>

I associate myself with the comments made by my colleagues. This government is doing what it does best: hiding from scrutiny, avoiding transparency, making decisions behind closed doors. We know that this legislation is ecocide. We know that you are environmental vandals. That's pretty clear. All you see nature is is as a commodity to use and abuse. Why? For the benefit of those corporations who line your pockets so that you can come back in here and do the same thing all over again: destroy the environment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry is about putting you, putting your government and putting this bill through a fine toothcomb, because the public deserve this. It is about the public knowing what you actually want to do, what your agenda is, and that is to destroy the environment. That's why this inquiry is important. Yes, we have known for years that you want to destroy it. You're vandals. This is ecocide. But the public doesn't know this and that's why this inquiry is so important.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why won't you let the Senate do its job? You are stopping us from doing our job. Our job is to look at bills. What are you afraid of? If you're so confident that this bill is so great then let us put it through scrutiny. That's right: you don't have to be part of the inquiry if you don't want to be. You can stay home, but we want this bill to be looked into whether you want it or not. Yes, we will fight this bill tooth and nail no matter whether the inquiry goes on or not, because this is about the future of our people in Australia and across the world. This is about the future of the planet. We want to preserve and enhance the future for the generations to come and for the inherent value that the environment has.</span>

From where we sit, we don't think there has been a gas-led recovery put forward by this government. There is no plan. After seven years there isn't even an energy policy. Labor has written to the government seeking to work with them on settling an energy policy framework, and the Prime Minister hasn't even bothered to reply. So the problem with this motion is that there isn't a plan for any kind of recovery and there certainly isn't a plan being put forward for a gas-led recovery; therefore we can't support this motion.</span>

Since last year we have seen assessment time frames improve from 19 per cent of key decisions made on time to 98 per cent last quarter. We have more than halved the time taken by the Commonwealth at the final stage of these assessments, to go from 90 days to 40 days. We're committed to reducing duplication and eliminating unnecessary delays and have agreed with all states and territories, through the national cabinet, to move to a single-touch model for environmental approvals.</span>

                  </a>  Services Australia makes over $180 billion in payments each year. Australians rightly expect the government to be resolute custodians of these taxpayer funds and work diligently to prevent and recover overpayments. When the income compliance program was established, it was on the basis of longstanding historical practice of many governments—Labor and coalition—and the understandings of the law at the time. As the government's understanding changed, it responded appropriately to refund all payments on debts raised that were wholly or partly relying on the use of the averaged ATO income data. There is also a court matter underway, as well as a Senate inquiry. A long-running royal commission won't help people get their refunds.</span>

                  </a>  The acreage release provides an opportunity for Australia to ensure energy security, bring down gas prices and support Australian jobs. The exploration and production of oil and gas in offshore waters, including on the North West Shelf, the Gippsland Basin and the Otway Basin, has been undertaken safely and responsibly for decades. Indeed, the pristine environment in these areas is a testament to the successful and rigorous regulation of the industry and its ability to coexist with areas of high environmental value. The Australian people can be assured that all petroleum activities in offshore waters will be undertaken safely and to the highest environmental standards.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While originally expected to run for a six month period, following a review of the program, on 21 July the Government announced it would be extended by a further six months until 28 March 2021 and that the payment would be tapered in the December and March quarters to encourage businesses to adjust to the new environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also announced that as part of extending the program, a two-tiered payment would also be introduced to better align the payment with the incomes of employees before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's decision recognised that Australia's economic recovery was still in its early stages and that a number of businesses and individuals remained significantly affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the time of being announced, these changes were expected to cost an additional $16.6 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Subsequent to this announcement and following the introduction of stage four restrictions in metropolitan Melbourne and stage three restrictions across regional Victoria, the Government announced it would make further changes to the program in order to help more businesses qualify for JobKeeper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 7 August, the Government announced it would ease the eligibility requirements so that post 28 September 2020, organisations will only have to demonstrate that their actual turnovers have significantly declined in the previous quarter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also announced it would change the employee reference date, so that from 3 August 2020, the relevant date of employment for an eligible employee will move from 1 March to 1 July 2020, expanding employee eligibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The combined effect of the economic deterioration in Victoria which will see more firms needing to rely on JobKeeper and the eligibility changes announced on 7 August will see the cost of JobKeeper increase by around $15.6 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes take the total cost of the JobKeeper payment to an estimated $101.3 billion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The extension of the JobKeeper Payment will provide much needed support for those businesses that continue to be most impacted by this crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nowhere will this be more important than in Victoria where the extension of the program will help to cushion the blow for businesses and their employees that have been severely impacted by the restrictions which have been introduced in response to the recent second wave of infections. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Around $16.8 billion in JobKeeper payments are expected to flow into Victoria during the December 2020 and March 2021 quarters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For many businesses, this support will be the difference between them remaining in business and reopening on the other side or having to permanently close their doors and let go of all their employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is why this Bill is so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 1 to the Bill extends the prescribed period of operation for the Coronavirus payment framework, enabling the extension of the JobKeeper Payment until March 2021. Consequently, the ability to make amended Rules to give effect to the JobKeeper payment will be extended and the Rules can be further amended up until 28 March 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also amends the relevant information sharing provisions to enable the ATO to share certain JobKeeper Payment information with Commonwealth, State and Territory government agencies to assist them in their efforts to address the impacts of the Coronavirus. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A two-tiered payment will also be introduced from 28 September. Employees who were employed for less than 20 hours a week on average in the four weekly pay periods ending before 1 March 2020 will receive the lower payment rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The phasing down of the JobKeeper Payment will ensure a smooth and gradual transition to economic recovery, while ensuring that those who most need support continue to receive it. The introduction of a two-tiered payment rate will also better align the JobKeeper payment with the pre-COVID incomes of recipients—particularly those who work part-time hours. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When the JobKeeper scheme was introduced, it was accompanied by temporary changes to the Fair Work Act 2009 (Fair Work Act). These allowed those employers qualifying for JobKeeper greater flexibility in operating their business, so as to respond to the impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic and assisted their employees to remain in employment and connected to their workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has heard from stakeholders and directly from employers that these provisions have been vital in keeping their business operational and keeping their employees in jobs. Survey results show that around three in four JobKeeper employers used the flexibilities in the provisions. Almost all of the employers surveyed that used the provisions said they were either important or essential for the continued operation of their business and for employees to keep their jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 to the Bill supports the continued operation of the JobKeeper scheme by extending the temporary JobKeeper Fair Work provisions in Part 6-4C of the Fair Work Act, except for those relating to annual leave until 28 March 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From 28 September 2020, employers who remain eligible for JobKeeper payments after this date will retain access to the full range of remaining flexibility measures in Part 6-4C in relation to employees for whom they are claiming the payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Legacy employers, being employers who have previously received the JobKeeper scheme, but who no longer qualify after 28 September 2020, will be able to access a modified version of the JobKeeper provisions in relation to employees for whom they previously received JobKeeper payments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To do so, legacy employers will be required to hold a certificate from an eligible financial service provider stating that they have satisfied a 10 per cent decline in turnover test in the previous quarter before they can use the provisions, and again for each following quarter to have the flexibilities remain in place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under these changes, legacy employers will not be able to use a JobKeeper enabling stand down direction to direct an eligible employee to work less than 60 per cent of their pre-Coronavirus ordinary hours, and cannot require an employee to work less than two hours in a day on which the employee works. Pre-Coronavirus ordinary hours will be assessed using the employee's ordinary hours of work as at 1 March 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under these changes, the various safeguards that apply to the existing provisions will continue, including continuation of unfair dismissal rules, general protections and work health and safety laws to name just a few. And of course, an employer must continue to pay an employee in full, including any penalty rates or allowances applicable to hours they work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are also enhanced consultation and notice requirements for legacy employers before they can give an employee a JobKeeper enabling direction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The JobKeeper Fair Work provisions provide greater operational flexibility for businesses in the recovery from the Coronavirus pandemic than the more rigid terms and conditions under awards and enterprise agreements and support the effective continuation of the JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme between September 2020 and March 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The measures will provide continued workplace flexibility at a time when businesses are still in distress and recovering from the economic impact of the Coronavirus pandemic. Ensuring the viability of businesses in these circumstances will help preserve Australian jobs and assist employees to remain connected to their workplaces, resulting in minimised job losses and lower levels of unemployment. </span>

                    </a>  You'd think of Queensland. Yet there is nothing that will stop the Labor Party from trying to destroy Queensland, and in particular North Queensland. North Queensland has so much potential. It has got rich land. We're going to build the Bradfield scheme if the Queensland LNP gets elected at the state election—we want to create jobs in North Queensland.</span>

                    </a>  A mandate, that's right. We on this side of the chamber are the party who believe in choice, not like that side of the chamber: command and control. It's the hypocrisy. The fact is that there has been $10 billion put into the Clean Energy Finance Corporation fund—a $10 billion subsidy for renewables. Do we hear the other side of the chamber complain about that? No. That's about 4,000 times the amount of money that we want to put into a feasibility study in North Queensland. Where is the equity?</span>

                    </a>  Nowhere! Of course, we always hear how solar is so much cheaper and renewables are now so much cheaper. Let me tell you this: if I look at the current prices, I see that they have been driven to zero in Queensland. That is totally unsustainable. Do you know why we have such a distorted energy market? Because of the Renewable Energy Target. I stood here six months ago and argued for setting prices for milk. I believe in a fair and level playing field and I'll do everything I can for our dairy farmers, but one thing I will never do is set output prices. I'll always level the playing field on the way in, but we always have to give people the opportunity to reach their potential. But we don't have a coal target. The reason why energy prices have been pushed up—until recently, when energy prices came down in the last three quarters thanks to the magnificent work of our energy minister, Angus Taylor, who, in spite of the unfounded allegations often made in this chamber, has done an outstanding job in driving prices down—is the Renewable Energy Target, which mandates that 33 terawatts of energy has to come from renewable energy. That is price-setting; that is communism. That's why those guys on the other side love price-setting—it's pure communism at its best. </span>

Sure, it might be free sunlight in the middle of the day, but guess what? You've got to transport that energy. This one is a real doozy; it came out a couple of weeks ago. To get renewable energy to make up 90 per cent of the grid, do you know how much money they have to spend to build all the transmission lines?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  This afternoon we are debating a very important piece of legislation, the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Australian Consumer Law—Country of Origin Representations) Bill 2020. Labor very much welcomes the legislation before us, but it is somewhat belated. This government has taken a belated path to ensuring that Australian vitamin manufacturers are able to say Australian Made on their labels. This has been a problem now for some time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are, indeed, Australian-made goods of high quality that Australians consume and enjoy, but they are also critically important in their export markets. It is unfortunate that these goods have been caught up in the difficulties with the 'substantive transformation' test. Despite the fact that these vitamins and therapeutic goods are registered as Australian-made, under the Therapeutic Goods Act they were found to be in breach of the technicalities of the meaning of 'substantial transformation' for use of the Australian Made logo. It's taken too long for the government to fix this issue. Australian manufacturers of vitamins and mineral supplements have had to remove the Australian Made logo from their products, and they've had to do this because of the government's incompetence. Labor called on the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Karen Andrews, to act on this issue—to stop an industry that's worth $5 billion to the Australian economy from being forced offshore and to stop it from having the 30,000 jobs within it put at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The labels were removed in the middle of 2019 as a result of uncertainty about whether vitamin manufacturers could legally use the Australian Made logo due to country-of-origin labelling changes which saw the introduction of the 'substantial transformation' test. We know that the changes made to the country-of-origin laws inadvertently created a contradiction, where complementary medicine is deemed to be manufactured in Australia under one law—the Therapeutic Goods Act—but doesn't meet the criteria under another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Complementary Medicines Australia have advised that unfortunately this issue has already affected about 200 Australian Made licences, and that any further delay would risk future investment. So it's terrific that the legislation is now—belatedly—before the chamber and being debated in this non-contro time slot. We that know many of the companies that have made these investments are here in Australia, including Sanofi's $40 million investment in their Brisbane manufacturing facility. Companies have made these incredibly large investments, and they've done that because Australia has a good reputation for manufacturing high-quality vitamins and it's also respected for its pharmaceuticals. That means household names like Blackmores, Swisse, Nature's Own and Cenovis are able to produce high-quality goods here and export to the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In submissions to the Complementary Medicine Taskforce, one local manufacture described clarity around country-of-origin labelling as being critical to their business. The potential loss of the made-in-Australia claim will have a direct and undermining effect on their marketing in China, while a third has said that they would think twice about introducing new products if they were not able to claim they were made in Australia. It is one of the few manufacturing industries in Australia that isn't in decline, and I'm sad to say that the government, in dragging its feet on this issue, has put the sector in jeopardy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian consumers also like to know where their vitamins and goods that they buy from their local pharmacy are manufactured. Many have a preference for Australian manufactured vitamins because, like the Chinese market, we believe in the high quality and the high standards of the vitamin manufacturing industries here. We raised the issue in September 2018, and that was following calls from the manufacturing industry in federal Labor. Finally, the government amended regulations to allow affected companies to use the logo until the legislation was passed.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the bill before us seeks to amend the Competition and Consumer Act. Here we are creating an explicit power to prescribe one or more processes which will be deemed to satisfy the definition of 'substantially transformed' for the purposes of the country-of-origin provisions of the act. This definition means that manufacturers can rely on safe-harbour provisions so they can make representations regarding the country of origin of their products without otherwise breaching other provisions of the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We certainly know that being made in Australia is a competitive advantage for this industry. We want to be proud and show consumers around the world that the Australian Made logo is a trusted consumer logo. We know that 30,000 jobs and a $5 billion industry were put at risk for every day this government delayed action on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Karen Andrews made a promise right back on 5 April 2019. She promised to heed Labor's concerns and make regulatory changes to protect these manufacturers. The minister said to industry, 'Industry should be assured that I am doing all I can to assist.' It's been 510 days since that promise. In that time, the Australian government has hurt manufacturers, workers and consumers. These actions have put at risk this industry which supports close to 30,000 jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The time that this has taken to drag on will impact on millions of dollars of export revenue due to the inaction of this government. It's placed at risk future investment in vitamins and pharmaceuticals here in Australia, because manufacturers weren't able to act with the certainty that they wanted when it came to these therapeutic goods. We've seen this half-hearted approach to this multibillion dollar industry. It has led to businesses stripping their packaging of 'made in Australia'. It's increased threats to Australian jobs and businesses. We've seen those frequent threats over time. We can see very directly that the government's incompetence and inaction has harmed Australian companies, Australian workers and Australian wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, though, Labor of course supports this bill. We welcome the fact that the government has at last finally taken action to address this issue. I do question why it has taken them so long to take action, and I really express Labor's concerns in the strongest possible terms about its lack of action and responsibility in making progress on this issue. That the government has not taken this issue seriously from the outset and accelerated its resolution more quickly is a great disappointment. It should have acted earlier to protect workers of this very significant industry. Put simply, 510 days is just simply too long for manufacturers to have been stuck in a scenario where they've been unable to display the fact that a product was made in Australia. It beggars belief that it has taken so long for the government to do, as the minister said, all it can to assist. There have been 510 days of inaction, 510 days of delay and 510 days of ignoring this issue and the 30,000 jobs it has put at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We very much welcome the government finally taking action on this. Labor do support the bill, but we really want to see this government do better when it comes to Australian manufacturing. It's talked of things like a so-called gas led recovery, but it's going to take a lot more than that to get industry back up and running properly in Australia. This is a government that has been completely devoid of adequate industry policy. It says it wants to have a manufacturing led recovery and it talks about gas being a leading element of that. There are no other strings to the bow that this government has put forward that will support manufacturing jobs here in Australia. This is yet another example of government inaction that has seen a viable and thriving industry threatened.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  Labor are pleased to support both the Product Stewardship (Oil) Amendment Bill 2020 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 2020. As we have seen emerge in Australia and around the world, product stewardship can and must be an essential element of sustainable waste management. We can't simply gather all our waste together and leave it for disposal. We simply must get better at closing the recycling loop to make sure that, from cradle to grave, our products are sustainable and looked after. This means having waste management pathways that are recognised from the outset of the sourcing and manufacturing of those products through their use, easy return and disposal of by consumers and then indeed their recovery, recycling, reuse and, in some cases, safe disposal. In the Labor Party we've been committed to good waste management because we understand how important waste management is for our future generations. It was back in 2009 that the Labor government created a national waste policy establishing a national waste reporting process and, indeed, introducing the Product Stewardship Act 2011. It's completely reasonable for us as a nation to expect that designers and manufacturers of products can, and should, shoulder some of the responsibility for mitigating the environmental impacts of their products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been terrific to see the focus of the ABC in recent weeks on encouraging people to look after the planet, including recycling. My son said to me last week: 'Mummy, small things can make a big difference.' It's clear in his mind that he is thinking of the individual actions that they take at his school where they recycle everything from toothpaste tubes, toothbrushes, bottle top lids, plastic tabs from bread roll packets—you name it and they have got an activity around recycling it at Maylands Peninsula Primary School. I would like to give that lovely school a shout-out today for their wonderful recycling efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can, and must, deepen our recycling efforts and work specifically with a much broader range of industries to get recycling happening. We know that currently in Australia about 500 million litres of lubricating oil is sold each year. Sadly, if it's not managed and recycled properly the risk of pollution to land and water is very serious. The Product Stewardship (Oil) Act established an important scheme that encourages recycling and discourages the harmful disposal of non-combustible oils. Labor very much notes that since the scheme was introduced in 2011 it has been very effective. Unfortunately, prior to that there was much pollution. Prior to that there was effectively no recycling of combustible oils at all. It's now the case, fortunately, that some 320 megalitres of oil gets recycled and properly disposed of each year. That is about half the total volume of such oil. It's a good community effort and a good environmental and public health outcome. We have before us the Product Stewardship (Oil) Amendment Bill 2020 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 2020 which are bills to fix some shortcomings that have emerged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to clarify the definition of oils in the PSO Act to apply to lubricant oils, fluid oils and other oils and greases manufactured from non-combustible base oils. We need to do this in order to reflect the original intention of the PSO scheme, therefore, excluding other oils such as diesel and other fuels for the purposes of this recycling and product stewardship legislation. Item 15 of the schedule to the Excise Tariff Act narrows the scope of petroleum based oils and synthetic equivalents oils, for which excise duties are imposed for the purposes of the PSO scheme, to exclude diesel and other fuels. Item 15 was inserted into the Excise Tariff Act for the purpose of levying oils covered by the PSO scheme and did not historically include duties on diesel and other fuels. So diesel and other fuels will continue to be subject to excise duties under other items in the schedules to the Excise Tariff Act. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, the amendments to these bills address what has been a significant discrepancy within the legislative definition of the word 'oil'. We need to ensure that only non-combustible oils are included for the purposes of claiming the benefits within this Product Stewardship for Oil Scheme and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill. They were recommended by the ATO following a Federal Court decision in Caltex Australia Petroleum Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation. We saw in that case that it allowed a broad and unintended interpretation of the definition of oils in the PSO Act, with the effect that it could include some combustible oils, like diesel, thereby perverting the operation of the PSO Scheme. This case was launched by Caltex. The Federal Court found that there was this loophole and so they received $8 million of Commonwealth money. That, on any analysis, was indeed outside the intention and original purpose of that scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's disappointing that $8 million of revenue was lost from the Commonwealth. In this instance, I think it should be a matter of concern to a great many—$8 million is a lot of money when it comes to funding our health care, our schools, our aged-care needs, our recovery from bushfires and our efforts to do more to address homelessness. This is especially so in the face of the current circumstances of our nation. So I'm pleased that these amendments are here before us to prevent the re-occurrence of another significant loss of taxpayers' money. While I think that of course Caltex was at liberty to chase down this loophole and use it, it was indeed outside the intention of the original scheme for it to have been used in this way and I guess I'm disappointed that Caltex did seek to exploit that loophole and take the matter to court. It was never the intention of this act—never at all—to give refiners of combustible oils, such as Caltex, access to this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party referred these bills to a Senate inquiry and we're very disappointed that the government refused to be transparent throughout this process. It showed an inability to explain the process it took in determining not to recoup the funds provided to Caltex via the Excise Tariff Act. I'd really like the government to take on board that disappointment and reconsider the way it thinks about these matters now and into the future. The government also delayed the statutory review of this legislation by three years and I think that underscores, despite all their rhetoric, a lack of commitment by this government to waste management and to the protection of Australia's environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Product stewardship is absolutely critical for our environmental future in this nation. We really should be looking to much more holistic product stewardship and involvement by government in clearing the path to make product stewardship viable and possible so that more and more of the products that Australian consumers buy have a proper recycling and waste management pathway. When it comes to waste and recycling, it is long past time for this government to take clear action—to take action on the three key areas of product stewardship: infrastructure, investment and procurement policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been incredible to me that Australia has lacked the ability to sustain a domestic recycling market—a recycling market which is much-needed to protect our environment and meet the expectations of the community. It has been extraordinary to see the fact that China has closed its doors to Australian recycling and yet it has taken such a long time for this government to get actively involved in making sure that we can create a viable and bright manufacturing economy that is based on the recycling of goods. Australia really should have a much stronger domestic recycling market. We know that it was only after several key trade nations banned the importation of our waste that the Commonwealth finally started looking at this issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, Australia only recycles 12 per cent of plastics and only 58 per cent of waste in total. Here in Australia we will need to increase our local plastic reprocessing capacity by some 400 per cent in order to effectively manage our own waste. So we've got a very long way to go on this journey. This government is far too slow to prioritise this issue, which is so incredibly important to Australians. Unfortunately, Australia has a very poor record on plastics. We stand to be heavily affected by plastic pollution in our oceans, and we are not doing our best to lead regional cooperation, including reducing plastic in the Pacific. We must lead by example. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a shout-out to the container deposit scheme for Western Australia that is about to start, in October this year. Its onset was delayed just a little bit by COVID. But it is due to be up and running just a couple of months after it was due to commence. This scheme, I think, will show that it is entirely possible to create positive manufacturing and positive community solutions to managing our waste in Australia. It's a scheme that will see community involvement where they will be able to tap into the profits of returning bottles and plastics for recycling, much like older Australians used to enjoy when we were kids. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I call on this government to do more on recycling, and to do more for our climate and environment. It has been seven years and we have Australians still waiting for an energy policy from this Liberal government. We are still waiting for an energy system to deliver lower prices and lower emissions. This week, we've seen the government want to give another $3.3 million to support a new coal-fired power station. This is not good enough. Australians deserve much better environmental leadership. </span>

It's always a pleasure to take an interest in the affairs of Norfolk Island, which is an important and unique territory of our nation. The amendments contained in this bill, as well as previous amendments made in 2018, are about enhancing and supporting the effective administration of Norfolk Island's justice system.</span>

Amendments were made to the Norfolk Island Act back in 2018 to reflect the view that in some cases the best interests of justice might be served by holding a criminal trial away from the island itself, where there would be better access to resources, expertise and advice. There may be some cases, I'm sure, where jury trials, for example, are relevant, and I imagine that doing something like that in a small community would be quite difficult. The amendments before us were modelled after similar provisions that were created for Christmas Island in 1987. We think it's really important to ensure community confidence and the integrity of the Norfolk Island justice system.</span>

I've always reflected on how novel and interesting those powers were, because in many cases we saw a self-governing external territory with some 1,700 people that had more powers of self-government than, for example, the people of the Northern Territory. It really shows that we need to think carefully about how we govern Australia's so-called territories. We've recently had some debates led by Senator McCarthy in relation to electoral representation in the Northern Territory, that I think should be supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The arrangements back in 1979 were that the Norfolk Island government was required to deliver government services, including health care, education and infrastructure. I have been to Norfolk Island and, frankly, I have seen that for such a small community to have the enormous responsibility of delivering both state and Commonwealth public services is at times a grave disadvantage to the citizens there. There were weaknesses in the electricity network, roads were deteriorating and the hospital needed significant upkeep. The size and remoteness of the community made it difficult for them to deliver those services effectively. The arrangements in this bill are about improving governance arrangements in the territory and ensuring Norfolk Island can move forward and have a local community that is provided with the same opportunities that are afforded to every Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think one thing that led to the lack of sustainability for Norfolk Island, in terms of its capacity to keep up its own road, education and health systems, was that Norfolk Island had been a tax-free trading place for such a long time. Australians would go there for holidays to buy their luxury goods free of sales tax. They could travel to an Australian jurisdiction and buy their luxury goods free of sales tax. When John Howard brought in the GST and flattened those taxes, the Commonwealth did not take adequate account of what an enormous impact that would have on Norfolk Island's sustainability, and you can really mark the decline of Norfolk Island's tourism and their economy since that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's been really important that this parliament pay attention to the welfare of the population of Norfolk Island. In recent years, through the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories—which in past years I've been a member of—we've seen members from both Labor and the coalition work with the department to develop and change the functioning of Norfolk Island, to the benefit of its local businesses and residents. I note that it has not always been a smooth path. Back when I was on the external territories committee, it was a complicated time because of the level of reform that was being undertaken. While taking over some of the powers of self-government that the island had, it was also recognising that, in exchange for taking over those powers of self-government, the citizens of the Norfolk Island community wanted and demanded access to health care, access to education and access to services that they had, effectively, been previously denied.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have before us today a bill that's largely technical, with provision to ensure the smooth carriage of justice between Norfolk Island and the much broader Australian legal system. The bill makes changes to amend the definition of 'host jurisdiction' in the provisions authorising off-island sittings of the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island. These amendments are absolutely critical to removing any doubt that the Supreme Court may exercise its criminal or civil jurisdiction in a state, in the absence of an arrangement between the Commonwealth and the state government or authority, where no powers, duties or functions are conferred or imposed upon a state officer. The bill before us clarifies the basis under which travel allowances are determined for judges of the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island, and this reflects the existing practices by which judges receive such allowances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Labor Party have consulted with the Law Council of Australia on the bill. We note that they raise concerns about the removal of subsection 60Q(6), which provides that fees and allowances of witnesses who appear in civil proceedings held in a host jurisdiction must be paid by the Commonwealth. It is highlighted in the explanatory memorandum to the bill that it is unreasonable for the Commonwealth to pay these fees in civil matters where, unlike in criminal matters, the parties concerned are normally responsible for the witnesses' expenses. So there's a rational argument here, but there's a need to monitor this situation because we really must ensure that this does not result in parties to civil proceedings incurring unreasonable additional costs during off-island sittings. I really want to underscore this issue to the government, because travel to and from Norfolk Island is very expensive, and I can only imagine that, given the current state of airline economies, it continues to be significantly expensive. I don't know, for example, the extent to which there are existing cross-subsidies for that travel that come from the Commonwealth government in order to make those travel costs reasonable. I certainly recall, back in my visits to Norfolk Island, that there was much debate about the need to keep air travel affordable, noting how isolated the island is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013, economic activity on the island was down some 24 per cent on the previous year. Forty per cent of shops had closed and many Norfolk Islanders were leaving the island for the Australian mainland or New Zealand. It's incredible to me that the Norfolk Island community has had access to social security and health benefits only since 2016. This includes the age pension, family tax benefits, Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. From July 2016, federal taxes replaced a range of really inefficient taxes and charges that were levied by the Norfolk Island government, including a local goods and services tax and punitive customs charges. I have to say, though, that I have some empathy for the Norfolk Island government's need to impose this ridiculous array of taxes, simply because their other revenue bases were so shallow and they didn't have the kind of basic income that was coming into the rest of the country through the provision of services like the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Medicare, social security and pensions. Norfolk Island's Legislative Assembly was transformed into a regional council, in line with the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on National Capital and External Territories. That has allowed for a gradual adoption of New South Wales state laws within Norfolk Island, providing a body of modern law through which the island's economic recovery could be guaranteed. I note that Western Australia has a similar relationship with Cocos Islands and Christmas Island, where the state laws of Western Australia apply to those territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a real pleasure for me to be able to talk about these issues in the chamber today. It's not often enough that we're able to take note of the significant issues that confront our external territories like Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. It's pleasing that Norfolk Island has been integrated into the Australian migration system to replace the migration arrangements maintained by the local government. We've seen Norfolk Islanders being provided with the same services as other Australians, while protecting their unique cultural identity and heritage. We've seen support extended to Norfolk Island through its transition at this really crucial time. This will ensure that they're able to survive this pandemic, because the banning of tourism and non-essential visits will have taken a significant toll. The island has been virus-free, which is terrific, but it has faced strict restrictions, like the rest of the Australian community. In March, non-essential visits were banned after the local government declared a state of emergency in the territory to protect its elderly population from the spread of the virus. And I have to say that that was a timely decision of the local government, and an effective decision, not unlike the decisions taken by the Western Australian government that have proven successful in keeping the virus out of our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the importance of these changes. While we have taken over most of the governance when it comes to the laws of Norfolk Island, it's really important that we empower local communities to make these kinds of decisions because—as we can see in this case and in other cases where communities have been able to put in place their own travel restrictions—they've been very effective in keeping out coronavirus. We've seen that Norfolk Island has been impacted by food shortages due to disruptions to regular shipments, and we've seen heightened concerns around the spread of COVID-19 in Norfolk Island, meaning that additional restrictions have been brought in to stop people leaving their homes. We know that some elderly residents recently returned from the mainland and, unfortunately, they did flout quarantine measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We look forward to working closely with the government to ensure that Norfolk Island has a successful future. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

This bill makes technical amendments to provisions of the Norfolk Island Act 1979 dealing with the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island. Amendments made to the act in 2018 authorised the Supreme Court to sit in a state or territory other than Norfolk Island in the exercise of its civil and criminal jurisdiction. These amendments allowed for a matter to be heard and a jury to be empanelled in another state or territory. The measures were modelled on similar amendments made for Christmas Island in 1987. The amendments in the bill address some technical issues regarding regulation of off-island sittings of the Supreme Court. These amendments also clarify the basis under which travelling allowances are determined for its judges. These amendments will enhance the effective administration of the Norfolk Island justice system. </span>

Norfolk Islanders are proud of their history. They are proud of their very unique place in history. They are also a very community minded, family oriented and self-reliant, can-do community who, it must be said, have faced significant challenges right throughout their history. Indeed, we saw some challenges during the transition that Senator Pratt was referring to in her remarks. But I want to put on record that I know this has been a difficult time and that the isolation is being felt more than usual during this COVID period. I very much look forward to the opportunity to be there again in the not-too-distant future. They are, as I said, community minded, family minded, self-reliant and can-do. Can I make particular reference also to the fact that there is great pride on the island in the contribution that Norfolk Islanders have made to the defence of Australia through various conflicts. I want to pay tribute to all of those veterans on the island as well.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  Labor will be supporting the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Dairy Cattle Export Charge) Bill 2020. The purpose of the bill is to make the current voluntary $6 live dairy cattle export levy mandatory. This levy will fund the dairy cattle export program, which aims to improve research and development focusing on animal welfare, supply-chain efficiency, regulatory performance and market access. In 2018-19, Australia exported 92,456 dairy cows, valued at over $180 million. The countries that dairy cows were exported to include China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Oman, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. China received by far the highest number of Australian dairy cows, at 75,072. That saw an increase in trade of 164 per cent year on year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians will be surprised to hear that Australia exports dairy cows to other countries and that levies are used to help exporters develop dairy herds in the importing countries. This is one of the reasons why the bill was referred to a Senate committee on 12 June this year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee received six submissions, and submitters expressed strong support for the bill. The submitters included Australian Dairy Farmers and the National Farmers Federation, who were supportive of the legislation. It is important for the Senate to remind submitters to Senate inquiries that the committee system is there to ensure that legislation is properly scrutinised and that government is held to account. The Australian Livestock Exporters Council has proposed to direct only $1 of the $6 per head to research and development and the remaining $5 per head to marketing activities, which would be spent predominantly in foreign importing countries. The annual report of LiveCorp, which is the live export research and development corporation, states that the current voluntary levy is split so that $4.80 goes to marketing and $1.20 goes to research and development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As it stands, the levy is voluntary. According to evidence provided by LiveCorp to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport, there are several problems with the voluntary component of the levy. These include the fluctuating and unreliable funding and cash flow, which limits effective budgeting and resource allocation; the limitations on long-term corporate engagements, such as recruitment and contracting; the efficiency losses through monitoring, identifying and chasing payments; the inability to enter into long-term, strategic or higher-cost projects; management of the risks of overservicing the program or the levy payers beyond the levy payments received; and management of the expectations from levy payers and stakeholders that exceed the capacity of the program. In addition, under a voluntary contribution arrangement it is more difficult to get consistent payment across a group of levy payers for industry good functions, as potential levy payers often have expectations linked to the service or benefits received by their individual business. This means that, according to LiveCorp, these challenges have constrained LiveCorp from successfully integrating the dairy program into its routine operations or meeting the expectations of stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">LiveCorp is not the only research and development corporation that is facing challenges in meeting the expectation of stakeholders. There are 15 research and development corporations, and many Australians will have little knowledge about the work they do. The structure of the RDCs is quite different today from when they were initially established by the Hon. John Kerin 30 years ago. John Kerin, the former Labor agriculture minister, believed—as did Labor generally—that government involvement in research and development is justified on the grounds of market failure, external benefits to society, research that supports the government's role in resource management and national interest consideration. They also believed that R&amp;D is a form of investment and that there cannot be efficient resource allocation unless R&amp;D administration is as efficient and effective as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't go through the entire history of the various changes that have occurred since John Kerin established the RDCs, but the Senate should note that over the past 30 years they have morphed into hybrid industry-owned RDCs, such as LiveCorp, who collect levies from their stakeholder—who in this case would be the live animal exporters. Today the RDCs are funded primarily by statutory R&amp;D levies or charges on various commodities, with matching funding from the Australian government. To expand Australia's rural R&amp;D efforts, the government matches expenditure on eligible R&amp;D, generally up to 0.5 per cent of the determined industry gross value of production. RDCs are accountable to both industry and government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Levies for R&amp;D and marketing are initiated at the request of industry and are collected and administered by the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment. These funds are distributed to the RDCs to undertake R&amp;D and industry services. The live animal exporters are strong supporters of this bill, because currently the voluntary levy is undercollected. In 2019 only $15,000 was collected from the voluntary dairy levy. However, if the levy were compulsory, over $550,000 would have been collected. That is quite a difference in revenue for the RDC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, more funding does not necessarily equate to better routine operations nor to meeting the expectations of stakeholders. Many levy payers are concerned that their levies are not being used efficiently or effectively with regard to R&amp;D and marketing. This is not just the view of Labor; Minister Littleproud commissioned Ernst &amp; Young in 2018 to undertake a review into the R&amp;D funding. It was a comprehensive review which was undertaken by the minister's current departmental secretary, Mr Andrew Metcalfe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the 2019 election, as the then Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, Mr Littleproud, claimed, that the report would look at how to get the most out of Australia's rural innovation system through spurring cooperation and collaboration, attracting capital from around the globe and developing our research ideas into cutting-edge technology. Fast forward to today, and what has the minister done to ensure that Australia has a world-class, modern and dynamic rural innovation system? Absolutely nothing. Indeed, post the 2019 election, the agriculture minister was reported as telling the Farm Institute's annual conference that the RDCs could expect a shake-up:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"One focus I had before the election was around our research and development organisations, to make sure they are fit for future," Minister Littleproud said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"We are ranked number 20 in the world, we have just as many researchers as the US and the Netherlands who are number 4 and 6 in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"As I went into South America, I remember hearing the Argentinians say you actually have the best research development people in the world, but they are bone lazy when it comes to commercialising their product."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister also talked about a culture change needed in the RDCs, and questioned:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"Are they fit for future? and how do we actually put a rocket under it and really drive it into a new pillar of agriculture," he said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would suggest that the minister stop talking about the problem and do something to fix it. We know that the minister's departmental secretary is an expert on the subject, as he was working for Ernst &amp; Young when they spent over $2 million developing a report for the minister. Mr Metcalfe's consultation was extensive and included both international and domestic engagement with stakeholders, a number of regional roadshows and 23 workshops held in various locations around Australia. There can be no doubt that Mr Metcalfe is well aware of both the issues facing these programs and also the solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March 2019, the minister received the report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Agricultural innovation</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—a</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> national approach to grow Australia's future</span>. The report made a number of recommendations aimed at benefiting all participants in Australia's agricultural innovation system. There are five recommendations in the report, including: strengthening leadership for strategic direction but also improving connections, collaboration and culture; balancing funding and investment to solve short-term challenges, as well as targeting transformational and cross-commodity outcomes; establishing world-class innovation practices, including disruptive thinking, ambition and entrepreneurship to maximise opportunities from our investments; strengthening the regions to maximise innovation uptake and to provide regions with a greater role in national priority setting; and establishing the next generation innovation platform for our data, physical infrastructure and regulatory environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the minister has not acted on the problem and not acted on the report. He just continues to talk about the problem without having the courage to do the hard work of true reform to ensure that our research and development corporations are fit for purpose and that other countries are not calling our researchers 'bone lazy'. Ultimately, while Labor is supportive of the bill, we have real concerns about whether stakeholder expectations will be met, and we urge the government to work a hell of a lot harder to make that happen.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  I rise to speak on the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Dairy Cattle Export Chart) Bill 2020 as the Greens senator responsible for animal welfare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill introduces a mandatory export charge per head of dairy cattle. It will provide for the imposition of an export charge on the export of dairy cattle and will amend the rate provision to provide for two different rates of charges, which differentiate dairy cattle from other cattle. A voluntary export charge of $3 per head was introduced in 2006 and raised to $6 in 2014. But over time exporters have stopped paying it. It is estimated that if a mandatory charge were in place during 2019 over $550,000 would have been raised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will come as no surprise to anyone inside this parliament, and outside for that matter, that the Greens and I strongly oppose the inherent cruelty of live exports. This opposition extends to the export of dairy cattle. We will not be supporting the bill that perpetuates misery for animals used in this trade. The Greens will be opposing this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The funds currently raised for the voluntary charge go to the Australian Livestock Export Corporation, also known as LiveCorp, to fund its dairy cattle export program. This bill would ensure that $6 per head is paid to LiveCorp for that program. As described in the bill digest for this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Dairy Cattle Export Program provides advice and support for market access, conduct research and development for dairy cattle exports and participates on and provides funding to the National Arbovirus Monitoring Program to underpin market access opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The major problem with this initiative is that the industry wants the funds raised to principally go towards marketing for the dairy cattle live export industry—not animal health, not animal welfare but marketing. In fact, the live exporters proposed that $5 out of the $6 will be spent on marketing and only $1 out of the $6 will be spent on research and development. I can only describe this as galling and really disturbing. It is unconscionable that any additional money the live exporters were to receive would go towards making their cruel industry actually look good and making their cruel industry more profitable in overseas markets, rather than investing and trying to minimise the harm done that is done to animals that we know is so fundamental to this trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about the $1 that will go towards research and development? What is it actually being spent on? Well, no-one really knows what this money is going to be spent on. It is time for some transparency and real accountability and oversight as to how this industry research is being conducted. Far too often it is done simply to protect the corporate interests of the industry and to undermine and distort genuine, independent evidence showing animal welfare concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need oversight of this research if it is to go ahead. This is particularly the case given that the federal government ordinarily matches industry research and development of this nature dollar for dollar. These are public funds that are going towards industry research that we know must have more scrutiny and more transparency. The live export industry has a shocking track record on animal welfare, that's a fact. It's an undeniable fact. This includes the welfare of dairy cattle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to a Greens' question on notice in May this year, the government noted that Bos Taurus cattle were found to have suffered heat stress crossing the equator. I will quote the department's own response:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A total of 39 voyages accompanied by an Independent Observer (observer) carried Bos Taurus cattle from southern ports of Australia over the equator in 2019. Observers reported varying degrees of heat stress on 49 per cent of these voyages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's almost half of all voyages accompanied by an observer reporting the stress that the animals were put through. This is absolutely inhumane and it is cruel. Parliament should not be facilitating the collection of money so the live export industry can market its products overseas and can improve the marketing of cruelty, nor should it be facilitating research and development that often harms, rather than protects, animal welfare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last few months, we have seen more and more evidence of the fundamental cruelty of the live export trade. This is an industry that cannot be fixed or made humane. At the end of the day, it must be shut down. In June, when we were last in this chamber, I asked a question about the <span style="font-style:italic;">Al Kuwait</span> live export ship, which had just been given an exemption to travel to the Middle East during the northern summer. In response, Senator Ruston, the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… this government has worked absolutely tirelessly with the industry, with the sector, with people who have an interest in the welfare of animals, to make sure our live export trade is done in a manner that is absolutely world's best practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian government is absolutely committed to upholding the absolutely very high standards of animal welfare while supporting a sustainable live export trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that that vessel has completed its trip to the Middle East, carrying a consignment of more than 33,000 sheep, and we have the government observer's report back, what did it find? It found clear evidence of serious animal welfare violations. About 1,000 sheep were identified as being subject to heat stress at score 4, which, according to the department's own heat stress score, indicates severe heat stress. Some people here may not care about the stress animals are put through, but they are living beings and we ought to care. This severe heat stress involves open-mouth panting with the tongue protruding, an appearance of being distressed and an extremely laboured respiratory character. A further 4,000 sheep were observed at score 3, which is the onset of heat stress, involving open-mouth panting, a laboured respiratory character and an appearance of extreme discomfort.

The risk to the animals travelling to that location at that time was incredibly high. It was the middle of summer. That's why, in fact, the department initially refused to grant the exemption—the risk was just too great. RSPCA Australia commented this month, saying:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Describing this voyage as a 'success' because relatively fewer sheep than usual actually died on board shows the industry is still clinging to outdated and inaccurate measures of animal welfare, something the 2018 McCarthy Review strongly warned against.</span>

The business model of the industry is based on animal cruelty, and that's why it has to be shut down. But I know that you, all sitting there across the chamber, don't give a damn.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Dairy Cattle Export Charge) Bill 2020. Live animal exports are an important part of our agricultural sector, contributing an average of $1.7 billion in export earnings annually and employing more than 13,000 people—that is, more than 13,000 Australians rely on the live animal export industry for their jobs and their livelihoods, particularly across rural and regional Australia. This is certainly the case in the Northern Territory, northern Queensland, and over in Western Australia, where our producers and live-export supply chains support South-East Asian and Middle Eastern market exports. Approximately 80 per cent of live cattle exports are sent from the north.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To reiterate the significance of this industry to rural, regional and remote northern Australia: when former Minister Joe Ludwig suspended the live cattle export trade overnight in mid-2011, our producers were in the middle of their annual muster. About 40,000 head of cattle were on trucks, in holding yards or already on their way to Indonesia. Overnight, producers suddenly couldn't sell their cattle. They kept them on, on their properties. To compound the pain of no income, many of the producers didn't even get a wet season that year. Pasture declined, and the condition of the cattle declined. They were put down or producers had to pay to ship them south to domestic abattoirs, when and if they could. In the Northern Territory alone, tens of thousands of head were shot in the paddock or died before they could be. People took their own lives. There was severe distress. That is what Labor and the Greens did, and they have no shame. They have no remorse. Although the former minister did realise the impact of his kneejerk reaction, the damage to Australian producers and their families, our regional communities and our Indonesian trading partners, was well and truly done.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have many friends in Indonesia: I have friends that are cattle producers, I have friends that are veterinarians and I have friends that are ordinary Indonesians. Madam Deputy President Walsh, I can't stress to you enough how this impacted them. They would say to me: 'Why has Australia done this to us? What have we done to you that you are taking away our food supply? Why do you hate us?' I commend our government for not appealing the Brett Cattle Company case that came out of that decision to suspend the trade. We've chosen not to put these families through any more hurt and turmoil. They have suffered enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be part of a government committed to supporting an economically and socially sustainable live-export sector which will always make decisions based on robust science, not fantasy and emotion. This government condemns cruelty to animals, as do I. We have world-class animal welfare standards in Australia, absolutely world-class. We're committed to growing the value of Australian agriculture by facilitating trade and increasing market access, including supporting a strong and sustainable livestock export industry that underpins the livelihoods of farm families—again, particularly in our rural, regional and remote areas. At the same time, this government remains strongly committed to ensuring exceptional welfare standards are maintained in this trade and across all aspects of farming and animal production in this country. The overwhelming majority of livestock export voyages are undertaken without incident; however—</span>

I was very deliberate with what I said in my presentation to the Senate this morning. I have great respect for the processes of the Senate; it's an important process that we follow here. I have said—and the Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions—that there are some things we haven't got right. We've quoted the example of the time when we had 24 hours to find completely new staffing for St Basil's in Melbourne, where things didn't happen in the way that we had hoped that they might. So we've been very open with respect to those things. </span>

I've admitted and acknowledged that on a number of occasions, and I've apologised on a number of occasions—quite appropriately. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been very open about the circumstance in Victoria. We've continued to build the effort. We've continued to build our response to ensure that Victorians in aged care get the quality of care that they deserve. The proof of the pudding of that is in the results that we're seeing now in residential aged-care facilities, where we've actually improved the number of facilities that are on our red list from 13 a few weeks ago, when we established the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre, now to three. In my briefing this morning we only specifically had conversations about two of those. We continue to work in the interests of senior Australians, and that's exactly what we'll continue to do.</span>

It is vital that Australia and all levels of government in Australia speak with one voice in our dealings with other countries. The Australian people expect and deserve that.

The foreign minister's approval in the instances just mentioned is not required. However, the foreign minister does have discretion to declare that they are invalid or that they not proceed if inconsistent with foreign policy.

The test is whether the foreign minister is satisfied that an arrangement or its negotiation does not adversely affect Australia's foreign relations or is unlikely to do so and is not inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy or is unlikely to be so. If the minister is not satisfied, he or she will have to refuse approval or may declare an existing arrangement to be invalid or may declare that negotiations not be continued. Subsidiary arrangements entered into under the auspices of an invalid arrangement may also be invalidated. For transparency, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will also be maintaining a publicly accessible register of decisions.</span>

I actually have answered this question before, in question time earlier this week. We very quickly learnt the issues around workforce, and at Dorothy Henderson Lodge we didn't at that point in time have our surge workforce provisions in place, and we had to rely on some capacity from New South Wales Health, which they provided. But within a week of the Dorothy Henderson Lodge outbreak we actually did have our surge workforce processes in place. Our contracts were in place very quickly. So, as I've said—and I said it this morning—as this pandemic has progressed, as we've learnt things that we need to address, we've continued to do that. We actually did put surge workforce into place. We announced the $101 million on 11 March, which was only seven days after the Dorothy Henderson Lodge outbreak commenced.</span>

One of the reasons we called a royal commission is that we wanted to have a forensic look at the entire sector. If Senator Sheldon had been watching the royal commission closely he would have seen that one of the questions the royal commission is actually asking us is the relationship between the sector and government, and I think it's a very appropriate question. So, I support the comments of Senator Fierravanti-Wells in that context, because the relationship between the sector and government is an extremely important one. I look forward to the recommendations of the royal commission in that sense, and I don't agree with Senator Sheldon with respect to the circumstances that came out of Dorothy Henderson Lodge, and I've— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I've mentioned that a number of times this week. So I reject the premise of the question put to me by Senator Sheldon. I have seen those actions put in place every single day as I have worked alongside health officials, officials from the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre and officials from the caseworker team that looks after every facility that has a COVID-19 outbreak. We have consistently looked at the circumstances in every other facility and we have looked at what we might learn and what we might do differently. We consistently ask ourselves what we might do differently. We have acted on the advice of the AHPPC and health professionals to ensure that we do the best that we can for senior Australians— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, the disability royal commission has been running since September of 2019 and many people and organisations have made submissions and shared their stories. However, there are a large group of disabled people who have not and cannot because the commission cannot currently guarantee their protection and confidentiality beyond the life of the commission. One person in particular springs to mind, a woman who is right at the beginning of her educational career and has suffered discrimination in that career, including in the school where she now works. She tells me that she will not tell her story until she can be assured that it won't in itself end her career. Will the Attorney-General apologise to people who have not been able to tell their stories because of his failure to act and do what he has been promising to do, which is introduce these protections to parliament which he has known about the need for since February of this year?</span>

After months of advocacy, it is believed that the government is intending to introduce legislation on this during the next sitting week of parliament. Can the Attorney-General confirm the intention to introduce this legislation in the next sitting week?</span>

When an outbreak is advised, we send a first responder nurse in immediately to assess the site. We also send our Sonic Healthcare teams in to commence testing both residents and staff.

That process started on day one. The close contacts of the initial staff member were tracked and traced. With the understanding of who the close contacts were and who the positive staff members were, staff were progressively furloughed from the site and the surge workforce was brought in to compensate for the loss of staff through the furloughing of those people.</span>

My understanding of what occurred at that site is that there was a progressive testing of positives over a period of time. That is a function of COVID-19; different people incubate at different times. So there has been a progressive growth in the number of positives in both staff and residents, purely because of the function of the virus. People don't incubate at the same rate. It may be that you're tested today and test negative, and two days later, which is the cycle under which we test—we test every 72 hours—you might not test positive to the second or third test, given that there's an incubation period of up to 14 days for COVID-19.</span>

Today's paper announced the government's intention to introduce legislation to unwind new and existing agreements between foreign powers and state governments, local councils and/or universities when they're not in the national interest, giving this power to the foreign affairs minister. The Australian people have seen our current Prime Minister approve the sale of Australia's largest dairy farm, Moon Lake in Tasmania, to the Chinese when he was the Treasurer. Also, the former trade minister Andrew Robb is now working for the Chinese company Landbridge, which has bought the port of Darwin on a 99-year lease. How do you intend to instil confidence in the Australian people and myself that the national interest will come before possible self-interest and all the United Nations and free trade agreements?</span>

And the Australian government has the authority to determine what is in our national interest based on our democratic system. It is the Australian people who ultimately determine who gets to make those judgements on behalf of our nation. Australians rightly expect the Australian government they elect to set foreign policy. A primary focus of our government has been protecting and promoting the national interest. Australia is a globally focused, open trading economy. We want to ensure that our exporting businesses can sell as many Australian products and services as possible all around the world, including and in particular our agricultural sector, which sells our amazing agricultural produce into markets all around the world.</span>

Any business that operates in the Australian economy of course has to comply with our laws, including and in particular our tax laws. Our government has a proud record when it comes to making sure that multinational businesses operating in Australia comply with our tax laws.

The first role of the Australian government is to keep Australia and all Australians safe. The stark fact, though, is that today, at the same time that we are facing a pandemic-induced economic shock, our region is facing the most consequential strategic realignment since the end of World War II.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our national interests are being challenged more directly and, therefore, we are demanding and we need a clear-eyed prioritisation of our Defence forces. That is why, on my appointment as Minister for Defence, I set three priorities for the Defence portfolio: strategy, capability and reform. The 2020 Defence Strategic Update and accompanying Force Structure Plan are timely and comprehensive and have been well received. These documents addressed my first two priorities, strategy and capability. They demonstrate that Defence thinking and planning have shifted gears in response to the changes in our strategic environment. </span>

The second is to deter actions against Australian interests. The third is to respond with credible military force when required. This government's clear-eyed approach demonstrates to Australians that their security and their prosperity are our first priority. In relation to my third priority, reform, Defence must continue to adapt and transform to ensure that we align strategy and capability with our financial resources. I will be making further announcements on the direction of that transformational work later this year. </span>

This will transform Army, Air Force and Navy. It develops two new military capability domains: space, and information and cyber. This locks in the long-term funding commitment that we made in the 2016 white paper. This unequivocally maintains long-term certainty for Defence spending. Both Defence and Australian Defence Industry rely on this funding stability, especially during this particularly challenging time for our economy. This financial year, as promised, we will meet two per cent of GDP. We have also decoupled Defence funding from GDP. On this side of the chamber, we have delivered the right Defence strategy for our nation and we have ensured it is funded. </span>

The vast majority of the Defence budget is spent right here in Australia: 32 per cent on the salaries of over 116,000 Australian personnel; 30 per cent on sustainment, which is mostly spent right here across Australia; and 34 per cent investment in new capability, which increasingly, as a result of our government's very deliberate policies, is being spent here in Australian industry. Over 15,000 Australian companies and 70,000 Australians are now benefiting directly from our investment in Defence. That number is growing rapidly even during the COVID period. </span>

I don't necessarily accept all of the arguments or statements or claims that have been made by the senator in her question. My understanding is that, yes, the Federal Court made final orders on Friday 21 August following the judgement that was handed down in Friends of Leadbeater's Possum v VicForests, which was handed down on 27 May this year. The government is carefully considering this judgement and its implications. I understand other proceedings, as the senator referenced, were filed by the Bob Brown Foundation in relation to these matters.</span>

                  </a>  I hear some of the commentary from other colleagues on this matter, and, indeed, it would be of no surprise that the Bob Brown Foundation would seek to disrupt any or all such activities that it could possibly find a means to disrupt. A constant challenge in some of these areas are those who seek to use every possible means to delay, to defer, whether or not the legal grounds are there, to ensure that the costs of proceeding with certain activities are ever greater. In the end, it's crucial that we have appropriate laws in place for the protection of the environment but also for valuable economic activities, like forestry, to be undertaken and provide the types of jobs, security and opportunities that they do in communities around the country. Our government is determined to make sure those frameworks work—work for those communities, work for the environment and work to preserve the jobs of those who rely upon them.</span>

The government are by no means taking a chainsaw to any environmental regulation or protection, but we certainly are going to do our best to take a chainsaw to delays and to red tape and to additional costs, and we're going to make sure that, when environmental regulation is applied in Australia, it is applied for the protection of the environment, not for the delay, the deferral or the applying of additional costs to viable economic activity and business activity. We want to see projects that can coexist with the environment go ahead without spending years in multiple duplicative approval processes. We want to make sure that those sorts of projects can actually happen and employ and create jobs for Australians without facing undue costs, unnecessary impositions, and that's why we'll work with states to do just that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The truth is that there are much more complicated issues at play when it comes to fire management, to forestry management, to natural resource management than the way in which Senator Rice seeks to summarise them. That's why our government supported and drove the delivery of a royal commission into bushfires, which, I have no doubt, when it hands down its findings, will demonstrate the complexity of the issues there in relation to bush management and to making sure that the nation is better equipped when it comes to bushfires in the future to prevent them. There will be a range of land management questions and issues addressed in that report, and we will, no doubt, then work through and respond effectively to those issues. But to simply summarise it in the way in which Senator Rice does, which seems to suggest that just locking up more land would somehow— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

If you consider that an aged-care facility with a COVID outbreak produces something in the order of six cubic metres of PPE waste per day, that creates quite a significant problem. One of the really good things that's occurred through the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre has been management of the waste. During that period of time we had a breakdown of one of the incinerators that was disposing of the waste of PPE in Victoria. We also had some regulatory problems in having enough heavy vehicles that were licensed to move the PPE away. But those things have been all been worked through, through the auspices of the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre. It may very well have been that a nurse saw large piles of waste PPE outside a facility. The COVID-19 outbreak— (<span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span>)</span>

It is National Skills Week this week. It is the 10th National Skills Week, and we are certainly celebrating what vocational education and training is able to offer to Australians. In particular, with the impact of COVID-19 both here in Australia and globally, we have seen an acceleration in the change in the nature of work. What we are very much focused on now as a government is our capacity to grow, to thrive and to create more jobs, which is very much dependent on employers and individuals, regards of their background, regardless of their circumstances, being able to access the right skills at the right time. That is exactly what a strong vocational education and training sector can do for Australians. The government understands the key role that vocational education and training plays in delivering Australians with the right skills for employers, and that is why, as a government, we are investing a record $6.5 billion. I will just say that again for the benefit of those on the other side. The Morrison government is investing a record $6.5 billion into our skills system. We know that you need to reform the skills system in Australia. The mess that those on the other side left—and I will address that in future questions—is still being paid for by Australians. That is why we're investing an additional $6.5 billion in skills reform across Australia.</span>

That was under the former Labor government. In addition, Senator Watt, over two years the former Labor government gutted $1.2 billion from employer incentives. They were not incentivised to take on apprentices, because you gutted the system. Since we have been in office, we have progressively reformed vocational education and training in Australia. As I said, we are now investing a record $6.5 billion in our skills system, and that includes getting rid of Labor's NASWD, the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development, and replacing it with a new funding agreement— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired).</span></span>

We're extending the subsidy to apprentices employed by medium businesses. Initially it was focused on small businesses, but we are now extending it to medium businesses in Australia. The extended wage subsidy will now support around 90,000 businesses, employing around 180,000 apprentices. In fact, as at 21 August the program has supported around 50,700 businesses to retain over 88,000 apprentices. This is despite the impact that COVID-19 is having on the economy. In fact, Senator O'Sullivan, in the state of Western Australia 6,227 apprentices and trainees are currently being supported by the $2.8 billion wage subsidy that we put in place.</span>

Quite frankly, the dishonesty of the Labor Party, who continue to misuse and misrepresent my words, becomes a bit tiring. It is clear that we have continued to act on the advice of those health professionals who have guided us all the way through the COVID-19 pandemic. In working and talking to the case managers that are looking after each of the facilities that have a COVID-19 outbreak, I have seen them acting on learnings from previous experience and ensuring that capacity is available. We have continued, as I've said a number of times, to build the capacity that we require, whether that be in waste management, whether that be surge workforce, whether that be— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Internationally, I have been speaking with a number of my counterparts overseas. This week I spoke to my social services colleagues in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, so that we could discuss our social policy responses to this once-in-a-generation, once-in-a-lifetime, once-in-a-century coronavirus pandemic. It was tremendously informative and productive to be able to discuss the issues that are, temporarily, facing just about every country in the world and to speak to them about the plans they have employed to date and the plans that they intend to employ going forward. Of course, as we come out of the health crisis, we now have to work out how we are going to recover from this pandemic and transition to what will be a new normal.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're all facing shared challenges, and all ministers said that, whilst our primary focus had been, of course, to put things in place as quickly as possible to address the needs of people, now is the time for us to start discussing how we might assist our countries and the people in our countries to get back onto the other side—how to get our workforces stood up again but, at the same time, make sure that we continue to support the people of our countries. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Kingdom and the United States have, very much, focused their packages so far on supporting people in employment situations and making sure that they retain their connection to the workplace. Likewise in Australia, and also in Canada and New Zealand, we've coupled that with not just working with people in the workforce but also making sure that we put additional supports in place for people who find themselves without work. Given the fact that this pandemic has affected every country in the world, we thought it was very important that we shared experiences so that we can, hopefully, get through this pandemic better.</span>

Canada advised that their emergency response benefit is set to end in October and their emergency wage subsidy will finish in December.

This is an important issue and it is being given careful and detailed consideration by government, as you would expect.

Any information provided to the royal commission in connection with or during a private session is protected from disclosure by law, even after the inquiry has ended.</span>

As I said in my answer, the facility was primarily staffed by the provider until we brought in workforce from 1 August. We had Sonic Healthcare testing staff and residents on site from 28 July. Between 27 July and 31 July, nine staff tested positive, but no residents. The first resident to test positive at Kalyna Care tested positive on 1 August.</span>

                  </a>  Again we've had the embarrassing situation where the minister has had to come back to the chamber to give basic details that he was unaware of during question time today. But, more importantly, in the minister's presentation during question time, he was again completely unable to give any explanation of why aged-care workers were left without adequate PPE. We have had reports to the government's own royal commission that aged-care workers were left with only one glove and only two face masks, and there is the incredible admission from the minister that the government only thought about ensuring that aged-care facilities had adequate PPE after an outbreak had occurred. The entire point of PPE is to keep an outbreak out of an aged-care facility. It's too late once it has got into a facility, and if you're then leaving staff with only one glove and two face masks, that's only going to make the situation it worse. Again, the government has failed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Thankfully, she's in relatively good health, considering her age, and she lives independently, because I'm telling you I would move hell and high water if she had to go into an aged-care facility. I would not be having that, because I do not have any confidence in what the government do in aged care. And it's not just in relation to COVID-19, as bad as that has been, as embarrassing as that has been, and as much as that has shown what a lazy government we have and that they don't actually have any respect for our elders. They don't care. They don't care about what happens to older Australians. Aged care isn't even in cabinet. Cabinet hasn't even been briefed. As far as I'm concerned, that tells us a whole lot about what this government thinks and how they treat elderly Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't trust that this minister has the competence to manage the COVID-19 outbreak, let alone the competence to run the system more generally. This is a minister who can't answer basic questions about COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care. He couldn't tell the COVID-19 Senate committee how many people had died in aged care, and he stumbled over this figure when responding to me in question time on Monday. He couldn't say whether he had briefed the federal cabinet on the interim report of the aged-care royal commission. Yesterday he scurried from the Senate while Labor senators responded to his weak defence of the government's record on aged care. Today, he couldn't tell us how much of the $205 million committed in May for staffing, training and PPE was actually spent on those items. He couldn't tell us what conditions were imposed on the spending of that money.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a minister that is on top of his game. This is the most critical issue for Australia in the last 100 years. It's not like it's just a little one-off episode where someone caught a disease. This is affecting the whole of the nation of Australia. It has put people out of work. It has stopped children going to school. It has put cities and regions into lockdown. He is the minister responsible for aged care and he can't answer these basic questions. I will tell you what we can do. Earlier today, Mr Albanese gave a speech at the National Press Club. </span>

                  </a>  It was a very good speech, Senator Farrell; I agree. As this government has absolutely no idea how to deal with any of the issues in aged care, the Labor Party will once again make some suggestions for them on what they can do. When Mr Albanese spoke in the National Press Club, he pointed out that in the absence of a government plan there are eight points the government could consider. This is once again Labor having to do the work of the government because they are so inept and incompetent that they can't actually work out what they need to do. What did Mr Albanese suggest? </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He suggested pretty basic stuff: minimum staffing levels in residential aged care; reducing the home-care package waiting list so more people can stay in their homes—that reminds me about a survey which showed that Australians have lost confidence in the system under this government. A survey by Fifth Dimension found that 54 per cent of people with family members in aged care are thinking of moving their loved ones into their own homes. This survey was conducted between 31 July and 3 August, after the deadly outbreak of coronavirus in nursing homes in Sydney and Melbourne. Of these, one-third are considering doing that permanently. That might actually solve a bit of the problem for the aged-care facilities, but it opens up a whole new problem for the government because I think they've got over 130,000 people on the waiting list for home-care packages. If these people have moved out, then a hell of a lot more people will be waiting for home-care packages. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DYU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAWCETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  I rise to address this question, because it is important and, as Senator Bilyk said, there are people around the nation who are concerned about older Australians in this COVID pandemic. The pleasing thing to report is that amongst aged-care recipients in the ACT there have been no cases. In the Northern Territory there have been no cases. In Queensland there has been one. In South Australia there have been none. In Tasmania there has been one. In Western Australia there have been none. New South Wales has had more. And Victoria clearly has a high case load. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's important to note that, of 208 residential services where there've been outbreaks, 183 of them—the vast majority—have been in Victoria, and 97 per cent nationally have had no outbreak. Why is that important in the context of this discussion? Senator Polley highlighted during her contribution a concern that a nurse saw piles of PPE in rubbish bags out the back of an aged-care home. What that points to is that PPE was provided, and the fact that there were piles of it means it was provided in quantity and, importantly, the staff obviously were following the protocols requiring frequent changing of the PPE. So there's actually a contradiction in the argument, because their own comments have highlighted that PPE, in quantity, was provided and that training was adequate—that people were following the procedures—and the issue here was the waste removal service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I would make when it comes to understanding the importance of the size of the community outbreak is: look at the hospitals and healthcare workers in Victoria. The state chief health officer in Victoria has now conceded that the majority of healthcare workers who have been infected with COVID-19 have been infected in the workplace. So, while in Australia 1,817 aged-care residents nationwide have contracted COVID, 2,563 healthcare workers in Victoria have contracted COVID. We are talking here about a younger, better trained, better equipped population of Australians in Victoria who have contracted COVID. These are people in professional healthcare environments who've been provided with PPE in accordance with state government and health department requirements, who've received training and who have the back-up staff for when people have to self-isolate—and there's a large case load of health workers who have been fronting up day after day and then having to go into isolation when colleagues have become infected. But, even in that workplace, we've seen a high rate of infection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What that points to is that COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease and, when you have a high degree of community transmission, even the best of protocols and the best of procedures in a healthcare environment have not stopped 2,563 professional healthcare workers in the Victorian health system from contracting COVID. So to attack the minister for aged care for the outcomes we're seeing in aged-care homes neglects the fact that there is a higher case load of infection among professional health workers, who have all the PPE they need and follow the protocols, and that's because of the infectious nature of the disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, a biological safety level ranging from 1 to 4 is assigned to various diseases. An airborne transmissional disease like COVID-19 is normally assigned a biosafety level of 3, or BSL3. They say that for testing you could perhaps roll that back to 2. But, in an environment where aerosols are being created because of the interaction between people, it is highly infectious. Where community transmission has been allowed to grow to such a size, the situation in the health environment in Victoria shows that the aged-care system nationwide is doing well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  [by video link] In his answer to my question today we saw the minister for ageing, Minister Colbeck, again fail to say exactly what it is that he did not get right. So how can we know he's fixed it, if he can't even say what he didn't get right? Now, he's admitted he realised he didn't get it right in the experience of St Basil's, but that was months after the experience at Dorothy Henderson Lodge and it was months after Newmarch House. Even still he says he's having conversations, but this week he hasn't been able to point to one action he's taken in response to warnings. He's referred to conversations, to talking, to letters, to webinars. Well, older Australians need a minister who will hear the warnings, who will take real action, who will get it right and who will protect the 200,000 Australians in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also saw in the minister's response to my question more self congratulation. When I used direct quotes from the minister, he said I was doing so dishonestly. Well, these were your quotes, Minister. They were your quotes, and I didn't use them dishonestly; I used your words about these exact issues. It may be difficult for you to hear, but they were your words. This morning you walked away from scrutiny again. You turned your back on this chamber and walked out on an issue you know is so critical not just to the people in here but to the people out there, to everyone with a parent in aged care, whether they've lost them or not, because everybody is scared about what's happening in Victoria. They are terrified about what could be coming to them because they have a minister and a Prime Minister who don't act. From not acting, how can they conclude anything other than that you don't care enough? Because you had warnings and time and time again you failed to heed them. And it is not just during this pandemic; how many reports have sat on your shelves, gathering dust? The warnings existed before the pandemic, they continued to flow during the pandemic and you let your hubris get in the way of action. And that is unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unacceptable for the families who have lost loved ones and lost them in the loneliest of ways. God forbid we ever have to say goodbye to our parents or our spouses or the people we love like that over Facetime, not being able to hold their hand. It is disgraceful. And self-congratulations doesn't cut it. It doesn't cut it. It's not acceptable. You could have fixed the issues with PPE, and instead we saw health workers with one glove. Just let that image sink in for a moment: one glove. What kind of choices are we putting these workers through? What kind of stress are we putting them through?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I reject the assertion from the ministers that we are questioning the commitment of aged-care workers. Are you kidding me? Labor is standing here for aged-care workers. We are standing here because we know what they are going through. They want to keep the people they care for alive, but they need support. They need help from the arm of government which is responsible for this sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So you can save your self-congratulations. You can save the hubris. You can save the words that I quoted to you and you felt uncomfortable hearing again. I wish I didn't have to quote them to you. I wish I didn't have to ask questions. I wish we weren't sitting here, holding the executive to account over this, but we are, and the least you can do is answer to this chamber. The least you can do is stay in your seat and be part of this debate instead of walking off to your office. The least you can do is listen, act and help. It's a simple thing people are asking of you. You owe that to the Australians in aged care. You owe it to every single Victorian. You owe it to every single Australian.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="144138" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  I have been listening very carefully to all of the speeches that have been made in this debate but in particular to that speech by Senator Smith that just preceded mine, because she made a very important point in her speech but perhaps didn't realise quite the point she was making when she did so. Senator Smith said that everybody in Victoria is scared. And she's right. As a senator for Victoria and as someone who has just come here to Canberra from Victoria, I know that there is no question about that. A lot of Victorians are afraid. A lot of them are scared about the impact this virus will have on their health and, indeed, the impact that the restrictions put in place to fight the virus will have on their livelihoods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is a clue in that observation by Senator Smith about what the problem might be here. She didn't say, that everybody in her home state of South Australia is scared. She didn't say everybody in New South Wales is scared—another state that has had some outbreaks—or indeed any other state or territory in the federation. We have heard a lot from Labor senators this week about the responsibility that the Commonwealth government has for regulating and funding aged care, and we absolutely accept that responsibility. But the Commonwealth has a responsibility for funding and regulating aged care in every state and territory, not just in Victoria. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what is different about the problems we are seeing in aged care in Victoria? Is it that the Commonwealth has decided to regulate and fund aged care in Victoria differently? Is it that they provided greater assistance to New South Wales or South Australia or any other state or territory? Or is there something different about Victoria? Clearly, there is something different about Victoria. We have widespread community transmission in Victoria. We don't have it in any other state or territory. Touch wood, I hope we never do again. But we have a very serious second-wave outbreak in Victoria, and that has nothing to do with the Commonwealth's role in regulating or funding aged care. In fact, it's got everything to do with the utter incompetence of the Victoria state government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I noticed in Senator Smith's contribution before—just as has been the case in every other contribution made this week by Labor senators—that the words 'the Andrews government' or 'the Victorian government' never pass their lips. Never do they point out that we have a problem in aged care in Victoria—unique, so far; we hope always to be unique in Victoria—and not anywhere else in the country. They haven't shown any interest at all—they have made no contributions at all—in how we got to where we are in Victoria. But they should, because we've seen day by day—whether it is through the hotel quarantine inquiry, whether it's before the COVID-19 committee of this Senate, whether it's before the parliamentary inquiry happening in Victoria—that, in the words of the AMA president of Victoria, watching the Victorian government's response to COVID-19 has been like watching a slow car crash. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a disastrous response. It has been a response that has shaken the confidence of all Victorians and, unfortunately, it has been a response that has directly led to the deaths of hundreds of Victorians, including many in aged care. The Victorian government bears the responsibility for this outbreak because the Victorian government has mismanaged hotel quarantine. They've known for months, but we learned last week, that at least 99 per cent of the current outbreak in Victoria is as a result of the failure of hotel quarantine. That's a system that the Victorian government entirely devised and set up on their own. It's a system where they had offers of support from the Commonwealth in the form of ADF assistance, which they turned down and which Daniel Andrews misled the Victorian parliament about, which has been confirmed by Lieutenant General John Frewen before the COVID-19 committee. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are responsible for this outbreak. They are also responsible for their failures of tracking and tracing. Professor Brendan Murphy, our former chief health officer, now the secretary of the department, gave disturbing evidence last week to the COVID-19 committee, where he revealed the shocking failures of the tracking and tracing system in Victoria. He revealed how underutilised they were, how underresourced they were, how they failed to use the COVID-19 app like the New South Wales government has successfully done. He pointed out that the whole reason this small leak in hotel quarantine became a massive outbreak across Victoria is because of those failures of the Victorian government. No-one in this place should take seriously any lecture from any Labor senator if they fail to mention these facts. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:29</span>):  First of all, we are seeing the federal government again fail to take responsibility for what is occurring regarding the outbreak of COVID-19 in the aged-care sector. The federal government has failed to take responsibility in the answers that were given through Minister Colbeck today. What's very clear is that the government has lost confidence in its strategy and in its person on front point, the person responsible for turning around aged care and making sure it is properly dealt with in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week the minister was sidelined from decision-making in his own portfolio. He was excluded from decision-making in the aged-care emergency response. And today in the House Mr Morrison refused on five occasions to get out of his seat and defend the minister's handling of aged care. On five occasions he failed to stand by the minister who has failed in his responsibilities for aged care in this country. When asked to defend the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Mr Morrison endorsed 13 ministers. Not one was Richard Colbeck. If Mr Morrison has no confidence in him then why should Australians? He has lost his responsibility and now he should lose that title.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government, through this minister, have failed to listen to the report, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>, that came out of the royal commission. They failed to take action. You hear these words from the minister: 'I listened', 'I talked', 'I considered'. What is missing is action. Despite the warnings from the Northern Hemisphere, the warnings from the experts and unions, the warnings from Dorothy Henderson Lodge, in March, and Newmarch, in April, he failed to take appropriate action, and he continues to fail to take appropriate action. Why are we in this mess? Because that failure is part of the pandemic of irresponsibility of this government when it comes to aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission into aged care just today received a quality and safety report from the University of Queensland, which found that 11 per cent of Australia's 2,700 facilities were rated as providing high-quality care, 11 per cent were offering the worst quality of care, and everything in between. The government have failed to deliver a robust system. They've failed to deliver a system that can make a difference. They've tried to do it on the cheap. Why I say it's on the cheap is that there's report after report saying it's on the cheap. It's estimated that providing the highest quality of care, as found in homes with fewer residents, to all 200,000 residents in facilities would cost an estimated $3.2 billion more than the $18 billion spent by the federal government on aged care in 2018. The government needs to act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard numerous examples of nonpayment of pandemic leave. We just heard that we have PPE but not for when the outbreak is about to occur, not as a risk management decision. They sais: 'We don't have enough PPE in our aged-care facilities. We don't have a plan on how to do that. We don't have a plan for how to use PPE in our aged-care facilities. But, when there's an outbreak, don't worry. We'll somehow find it and rush it down when the outbreak has already occurred.' That is after the event. You need to take action, not just sit back, listen, consider—'I'm hearing what people are saying.' It is about taking action. We've seen so many circumstances of people not receiving PPE, where action hasn't been taken by this government. Recently, the Health Services Union exposed actions that weren't taken in their industry, in aged care. I'll finish with this: an aged-care worker has called for the government to take action so that residential aged-care workers are protected— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:34</span>):  [by video link] Let us be very, very clear: the government have known for no less than nine months that there exists an impediment to disabled people, to organisations and to other individuals wishing to give evidence to our royal commission into disability abuse. The chair of the royal commission flagged this as an issue at the hearings in November. The chair subsequently wrote to the government, in February of this year, stating clearly that the absence of appropriate privacy protections—the absence of legislative amendments to the Royal Commission Act that would protect the confidentiality of people's submissions beyond the life of the royal commission—was an impediment to the commission's ability to do its job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be absolutely clear what the impact of the failure to act that we have seen from the government is upon people. Disabled people, having been through trauma, having been through abuse, having been subject to discrimination by their employer or by individuals, now wish to come before their royal commission and tell their story. And yet, in this very moment when they should be able to feel supported to do it, they are afraid. They are afraid that, should they speak, they will never work again. They are afraid that, should they speak, their families will be impacted. They are afraid that, should they speak, the situation that they find themselves in will get worse. And they are not telling their stories. They are calling hotlines run by the royal commission to be told: 'Do not tell your story, because in the absence of these amendments it is not safe.' The minister says this is under consideration, that they've been looking into it: that is the same answer you gave me in estimates in February. It is not good enough for you to have been looking at this issue for this long and to have failed to act. If you do not introduce this legislation into the parliament, then we Greens will.</span>

They fly in the face of the Federal Court finding that logging is damaging and destroying habitat critical to the survival of the critically endangered Leadbeater's possum.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so what are they going to do? Rather than taking action, rather than actually listening to the interim report that they commissioned from Graeme Samuel into our environment laws—who has told us that Australia's environment is in an unstable state of decline and under increasing threat and that our environment laws are ineffective—and rather than strengthening our laws, no, they've moved legislation in the House today that is taking a chainsaw to environment laws. It is going to hand over more powers to the states, who have proved themselves totally incapable of protecting our environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a government that's actually going to stand up for our environment, our precious forests and our precious wildlife that the people of Australia really want to see protected. And this government is not doing it. I say to the people of Australia: if you're as angry as me, then we need to take action, and we need to take it fast. We cannot let the government get away with it. We cannot just allow our wildlife to become extinct. This government needs to hear from you and it needs from hear from you loud and clear about this trashing of our environment laws. And if they don't listen then we need to get these environmental vandals out of office.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  by leave—On the morning of 4 June last year, officers from the Australian Federal Police raided the home of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst. It was over a story published in April 2018 about a proposal to allow the Australian Signals Directorate, for the first time, to access the emails, bank records and text messages of Australians if approved by the Minister for Defence and Minister for Home Affairs. In May this year, Annika shared the impact of those raids on her. She wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Would you prefer strangers look through your bras and briefs, or the contents of your bathroom cupboard and private text messages? I was forced to hand over the passcode to my mobile phone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the risk of further damaging the reputation of Millennials, giving police access to my iPhone—and therefore my text messages, search history and screenshots—filled me with incredible anxiety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It might not sound like a hardship, and it doesn't deserve comparisons with the horrifying violence inflicted on journalists in some countries, but this was an incredible intrusion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The day after Annika Smethurst's home was raided, AFP officers raided the Sydney headquarters of the ABC. These raids were about a story from July 2017. The story related to alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. The day of the raids on Annika Smethurst's home, the Prime Minister was in London, and, when asked about the raids, he said, 'It never troubles me that our laws are being upheld.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But those raids weren't simply about laws being upheld. They—quite comfortingly now—highlighted issues that exist within our national security legislation and framework. The following week I wrote in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> that we should review the balance between national security and press freedom. At the Midwinter Ball last year, in a room full of journalists, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, made it clear:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Journalism is not a crime and should never be treated as such. It's something we simply can't be complacent about so we need to cherish it, we need to nurture it, and we need to support whatever legislative change is required to ensure that press freedom remains a central component of our democratic system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was Labor's position last year and it remains Labor's position today. Freedom of the press is central to a functioning democracy. A robust free press makes our democracy stronger and our nation more secure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are ever-present threats to our democracy, including foreign interference and espionage, but it wasn't until those raids in June 2019 that the parliament, the media and the Australian people would have thought that freedom of the press in Australia was under attack. When freedom of the press, a basic tenet of our democracy, is seen to be under attack, any government—Labor or Liberal—must speak up. When a perception of bias starts to develop around the police, the government must restore that trust. This report is a first step to doing both of those things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the outset I will make clear that Labor did not believe the PJCIS was the best forum for conducting a comprehensive inquiry into freedom of the press and the public's right to know. We proposed and attempted to establish a parliamentary joint committee set up for the specific purpose of recommending legislative and other steps to consider these matters. We believe such a committee would have been a better vehicle to consider whether the country's laws are getting the balance right between national security legislation and freedom of the press. This does not discredit the report that is being tabled today but rather highlights the fact that there is still more work to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final report from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security inquiry into freedom of the press has unanimously concluded that the existing law in Australia does not adequately protect freedom of the press. In total, the PJCIS report made 16 bipartisan recommendations and, if implemented, these recommendations would result in significant improvements in our laws, including improved legal protections for journalists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most significant changes recommended relate to how all overt and covert warrants that relate to a person who is working in a professional capacity as a journalist or in a media organisation are contested and issued. The PJCIS accepted that law enforcement agencies should not be required to give journalists or media organisations prior notice of a warrant. However, the committee recommended that warrants for journalists or media organisations must be contestable by a public interest advocate before a senior judge. If these processes had been in place when law enforcement agencies sought warrants for News Corp's Annika Smethurst and two ABC journalists, Dan Oakes and Sam Clark, it's quite possible the outcomes would have been different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommended four significant changes to how warrants relating to media organisations or journalists are issued: all warrants sought by an enforcement agency related to a media organisation or a person working in a professional capacity as a journalist must be considered and authorised by a superior court judge or a nominated Federal Court judge as the issuing authority; all warrants are to be contested in front of the issuing authority; a public interest advocate must make a submission to the issuing authority; and the issuing authority must consider both the application from the agency seeking the warrant and the submission from the public interest advocate. I will note the committee recommended that public interest advocates must be a QC or an SC or have served as a High Court judge or a state and territory supreme court judge and they would be appointed for five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also determined that this new process of contested warrants should be expanded to apply not only to journalist's information warrants under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act but also to a number of pieces of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee recommended journalists' information warrants under the Telecommunications Act only be available in relation to an investigation of a serious offence, meaning those punishable by imprisonment of at least three years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PJCIS recommended a range of new record keeping and reporting requirements to ensure greater transparency for warrants relating to professional journalists and media organisations. This includes a requirement on government to publish the number of covert and overt warrants in relation to journalists issued under Commonwealth legislation. The committee made recommendations that go to the manner in which Commonwealth agencies interact with journalists and media organisations in order to better facilitate and support public interest journalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As mentioned earlier, the PJCIS made 16 bipartisan recommendations, including changes to the Public Interest Disclosure Act, changes to the way government classifies secret information and processes freedom-of-information requests and on harmonisation of state and territory shield laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report is a valuable contribution to the public debate on this issue. But it's only the beginning point. There is considerably more work to do to protect the public's right to know. Labor calls on the Morrison government to urgently implement the bipartisan recommendations of the PJCIS and use those recommendations as a starting point for further reform. No journalist should ever face the prospect of being charged or jailed just for doing their job. Law enforcement agencies should never raid journalists just because they are embarrassing the government. A strong and independent media is vital to holding governments and oppositions to account and to informing the Australian public. Labor will always continue to fight to defend and strengthen press freedom and the public's right to know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would like to place on the record my appreciation of the Liberal members of the committee, including the chair, Andrew Hastie, for the constructive and bipartisan way we worked together to deliver this report. This report was an unusual one for the PJCIS; it was not the usual work of the committee. We did not review a specific piece of legislation. This committee is not normally tasked with both defining a problem and defining a solution. As such, it was a complex task, made even more difficult due to the restrictions COVID placed upon the parliament and its processes. In that vein, I acknowledge all the members of the committee, Labor and Liberal; the leadership of the chair, Andrew Hastie, and the deputy chair, Anthony Byrne; and the secretariat for their unfailing work and focus on ensuring that we were able to deliver this report to the parliament and the government.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leave granted; debate adjourned.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak to the tabling of the scrutiny of delegated legislation committee's Delegated Legislation Monitor No. 9 of 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I wish to draw the Senate's attention to three instruments which raise significant scrutiny concerns and are highlighted in chapter 1 of the monitor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first instrument that I draw to the Senate's attention is the Coronavirus Economic Response Package (Deferral of Sunsetting—Income Management and Cashless Welfare Arrangements) Determination 2020. This instrument defers the sunsetting of primary legislation to extend the end date for the cashless debit card trial in all existing sites and income management in the Cape York region from 30 June 2020 to 31 December 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee would ordinarily expect such a significant measure to be included in primary legislation, rather than delegated legislation, consistent with previous extensions to the cashless welfare arrangements. The government has justified the use of delegated legislation in this instance on the basis that the disruptions to the parliamentary sittings caused by COVID-19 prevented parliament from considering the extension before the arrangements expired on 30 June 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As parliament has now resumed a regular sitting pattern, the committee considers that there is no longer a reasonable justification for this matter to be included in delegated legislation. Accordingly, the committee calls on the minister to introduce the necessary bill without delay and advises the chamber of its intention to seek to disallow the instrument if the bill is not listed for consideration in the next sitting week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second instrument I wish to highlight is the Competition and Consumer (Industry Codes—Dairy) Regulations 2019. The instrument creates the Dairy Industry Code of Conduct, which sets enforceable minimum conduct standards for business practices between dairy farmers and corporations that buy and sell milk. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since February this year, the committee has engaged extensively with the government about the imposition of significant civil penalties in section 11 of the instrument for failure to comply with the undefined term 'good faith'. As a matter of technical legislative scrutiny, the committee strongly considers that civil penalty provisions should be drafted with sufficient clarity to enable persons and entities to understand their obligations and the consequences of noncompliance. In particular, the committee considers that it is important for farmers on the ground to be able to understand their rights and obligations by reading the text on the face of the instrument, without the need to also understand nebulous common-law concepts of good faith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Examples provided by the Attorney-General, the Treasurer and the Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management of good-faith obligations in other Commonwealth laws raised broader concerns about the pursuit of regulatory flexibility via the imposition of broadly drafted good-faith provisions at the expense of legal clarity and certainty. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Noting that the instrument raises complex, systemic issues relevant to both delegated and primary legislation, the committee has requested that the Attorney-General refer the codification of good-faith obligations in Commonwealth legislation to the Australian Law Reform Commission for inquiry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General's response will assist the committee in determining whether to withdraw the notice of motion to disallow the instrument, which must be considered by the Senate by 3 September 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third instrument is the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment (Threshold Test) Regulations 2020. This instrument has the effect of requiring the majority of actions relating to foreign investment in Australia to be notified to the Treasurer for review to assess whether they are contrary to the national interest. The instrument does not specify an end date to the measures. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="237920" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  I rise to speak to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's inquiry into the impact of the exercise of law enforcement and intelligence powers on the freedom of the press. No sensible person who serves in this institution nor any person with an appreciation of our history would discount the importance of a free press to the integrity of our democracy. It is absolutely vital as a bulwark against tyranny. That principle operates in competition, though, with other really important principles. Those include the importance of all people being equal before the law—that the rule of law must apply to us all if it is to mean anything at all. It also includes a government's responsibility to keep Australians safe from those who would do harm to them or to our nation as a whole. They're all important considerations, and the challenge for any government is in getting the balance between each of those right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to contribute to the debate on this report on the day that it is presented in this place. In doing so, I would like to acknowledge those members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security who worked really hard to consider submissions from many different groups and to work through what are complex problems in a proactive spirit designed to set this parliament up for good government long into the future. I'd like to thank the secretariat for its hard work. They are a dedicated and very skilled group of people. I'd also like to commend those opposite for the degree to which a bipartisan approach was taken. These are difficult matters, but there was a commendable spirit of cooperation among everybody on the committee in this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in response to public interest arising from the execution of two search warrants by the Australian Federal Police in June 2019. It had evoked discussion among the public about the impact of law enforcement and intelligence powers on the ability of the press to do their job. It's worth acknowledging at this point that many of the concerns that were raised by members of the press at that point in time have already been the subject of action by the government, and I acknowledge those steps that have already been taken. Although those steps are welcome and they have been rightly implemented, nevertheless the committee, in its analysis, saw a number of other opportunities for meaningful reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We received submissions from a number of different bodies, but it's worth noting that the submissions we received, either in a documentary form or face-to-face, were dominated by media organisations and academic-style think tanks. There is nothing wrong with that, of course; however, they suffered from an understandable information asymmetry, for want of a better term, with the agencies who need the benefit of these protections. After all, the very complaint that those media organisations were making was that they didn't have visibility on the sensitive information about security that is held by our national security agencies. There is nothing surprising about that. But it's also true to say that the beneficiaries of the protection of our security agencies are ordinary Australian citizens, and they don't tend to be the kinds of people who put pen to paper to write a submission to a parliamentary inquiry or, indeed, to seek the opportunity to present for themselves at our hearings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that's something we should acknowledge more often in the work of all of the committees of this parliament. For all the bluster we hear in this place about vested interests, it's true to say that the interests of regular Australians and the interests of the person pursuing a quiet life can get lost amongst all the groups, of all different types, with an activist agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In any event, the committee worked together very well and has come up with a number of opportunities for the further reform of the law in this field. I want to touch on a few of those. We can improve upon our current regime for the issuing of warrants where they are required to be issued against a journalist. Our recommendations make that clear. We've recommended that the existing role of the public interest advocate, as exists under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, be amended and expanded to apply to warrants that involve the investigation of unauthorised disclosures of government information where that relates to journalists and media organisations. In recognition of the gravity of the occasions where national security may encroach upon the freedom of the press, the committee has also recommended elevating the qualifications that are required for those people who both serve as public interest advocates and who serve as issuing authorities for warrant applications. We've recommended that it no longer be the case that you can nip down to the local JP or magistrate for a warrant of this kind but that it should be dealt with by people who are exceptionally qualified—at the Queen's Counsel, Senior Counsel, judge or retired judge levels of a superior court. Specifically, we've recommended that all warrants sought by an enforcement agency related to a person working in a professional capacity as a journalist, or a media organisation, should have that higher level of qualification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the committee has not acceded to a request that was made by those in the media for an exemption from particular crimes that arise from the disclosure and possession of particular secret information, we've nevertheless agreed that there is an appropriate place for defences to a number of secrecy offences and that those defences should be considered for expansion in certain cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that, in considering the role of the public interest advocate, the scope of what they are asked to do is fully understood. The committee has recommended that public interest advocates stand in the shoes of the public's interest in a free press. It's not publicly funding a lawyer to go and act for a journalist in their professional capacity; nor is it a publicly funded lawyer who goes and stands in the shoes of News Corp to argue against our law enforcement agencies. Instead, it's a publicly funded public interest advocate who will stand in the shoes of the interests of you and me in the protection of our institutions by the protection of the principle of a free press. I think that's an important distinction to make, and one that the committee thought was important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee acknowledges that there was a role, at least in the events giving rise to this committee inquiry, for better cooperation between journalists, media organisations and government departments. We've recommended that the government consider a mechanism for journalists and media organisations to better communicate with one another and the originating agency of information that they wish to put into the public domain and that they should get credit for that attempt to constructively liaise with our national agencies so that they have an assurance that they're not going to face prosecution in circumstances where they are genuinely working constructively in the public interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also noted the concerns that had been raised about the appropriateness of national security classifications of documents and recommended that oversight bodies audit and inquire into the application and the implementation of the National Security Classification Framework so that we can be sure that there isn't a pattern of overclassification of documents, so to speak. Finally, the committee noted that it is really important that the impact of these recommendations be measurable, so we have suggested that there should be additional reporting measures on the frequency of warrants of this kind being sought, the degree to which the service of the public interest advocate is employed, their level of qualification and the activity in which those public interest advocates are engaged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important report, and it has been put together constructively by members of the committee. With that, I commend it to the Senate with my fullest endorsement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak on the President's report to the Senate on the status of government responses to parliamentary committee reports. This report shows the status of responses as at 31 December last year. At that time, the response of the Senate Select Committee on Charity Fundraising in the 21st Century was more than six months overdue. Today this report is still overdue, by more than 15 months. Why has the Morrison government been so slack in responding to this report, which addresses important issues for the charities and not-for-profit sector?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is it because they've had six ministers responsible for charities over the seven years they've been in power, or could it be because they've got nothing to report? It has been two years since the independent review and the ACNC called on the Morrison government to fix our outdated charity fundraising laws. The select committee inquiry reiterated this call in its report. Even government senators—Senator Abetz and Senator Stoker—joined the call for their own government to act urgently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The responsible minister, Senator Seselja, continues to claim he is in discussions with the states and territories. We're all wondering if these discussions will ever end? Will there ever be an outcome? What is the agenda? What actions have been agreed to so far? Has the assistant minister lobbied the COVID-19 Coordination Commission or its not-for-profit working group? Has he added this simple solution to national cabinet's list of harmonisation priorities? If he has, why has nothing happened? If the assistant minister cannot answer these basic questions then we can only conclude that nothing has been progressed and he is dragging his feet while charities are dragged down by unnecessary regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every month that goes by that this government fails to act on this red tape nightmare is costing charities over $1 million. That's money donated by Australians for important social and environmental causes just going down the drain, because of the government's failure to act once again. If Senator Seselja and the Morrison government would hurry up and do their jobs they could provide some much-needed relief to a sector which is facing a perfect storm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to JBWere, donations are expected to fall by seven per cent in 2020 and a further 12 per cent in 2021. At the same time charities are experiencing a massive increase in demand for their services, 50 per cent in the case of Foodbank and almost 80 per cent for Cystic Fibrosis Australia. A report by Social Ventures Australia and the Centre for Social Impacts notes that one in six charities could be forced to close by Christmas—one in six!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A range of charities have come together during the pandemic to form the Charities Crisis Cabinet. The CCC has told the government, in their prebudget submission, that the time for action on reforming charity fundraising regulation was, 'more than 25 years ago'. It's completely outrageous that after almost two years this government has failed to act on an inquiry report which had support from all parties that participated. It's time for the Morrison government to take some leadership, to fix Australia's outdated and burdensome charity fundraising laws and to actually show that they care about the people who work in charities and not-for-profits. They are happy when something like COVID-19 comes along and they need support from the charities. They're out there. They probably do a bit of a spin around a couple of them, but they won't actually do anything to fix the issue, and that's what the issue is here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's nearly 15 months since the Senate select committee handed down its report and nearly two years since the ACNC handed down their report. Both say the same things. Both are asking for this government to actually do something, to get off their backsides, to pull up their socks and to sharpen their pencils. If they can't do it all at once then do it in pieces, but for heaven's sake do something. Don't just keep spinning. Don't just keep giving us media releases, little TV advertisements and little bits of social media; actually do something. COVID-19 has made this hit the mark for so many Australians: the one thing this government has proven is that it is pretty good at spin—I don't deny that—but they don't actually ever deliver the goods. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to use this opportunity on behalf of all of the senators in this place, I'm sure, to acknowledge our appreciation—indeed, the appreciation of many, many, many Australians—of Professor Brendan Murphy's stewardship of our country's health response in what we all hope will be the final stages of a short pandemic. Professor Murphy is familiar to some senators who have spent their time on the community affairs committee. At the Senate estimates hearings, Professor Murphy sits from the very beginning of the community affairs Senate estimates hearings to the very, very end of them. Those people who are avid watchers of the estimates process—and I notice that Senator Siewert is here—know that Professor Murphy's contributions, when they're called upon, have always been tremendously insightful. They've been concise, which is a virtue at Senate estimates proceedings.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been good that the whole country has been able to see Professor Brendan Murphy's immense talents and his health expertise, and I wanted to use this brief opportunity on behalf of all senators and on behalf of my Western Australian constituents to extend our deepest appreciation for the work that he did as Chief Medical Officer for the Commonwealth. Of course, he now moves into a new role, and we'll see him again at Senate estimates in a few months time as the new Secretary of the Department of Health. We thank him for his service to date, and we look forward to his service and contribution in the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report was a very, very important report. It was important then, and it's even more important now. I'll remind people what this report is. This is the Community Affairs References Committee report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Effectiveness of the aged care quality assessment and accreditation framework for protecting residents from abuse and poor practices, and ensuring proper clinical and medical care standards are maintained and practised</span>. I'm talking to the government response to that report. And, given the circumstances, I'm even more disappointed about this response than I would have been otherwise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to most of these very important recommendations, the government 'notes' the recommendation. For example, the government 'notes' the committee's recommendation that the Australian government clarify that residential aged-care providers ultimately hold a duty of care to all residents. You would have thought, given that the committee thought it was so important that we raised it, that the government would do more than just note that recommendation. The government 'notes' the recommendation that the requirements for a model of care and clinical governance framework be more clearly articulated within the Single Aged Care Quality Framework. Again, you would think it would do more than just note that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I remind senators that this report was tabled in April 2019. I would very strongly argue the government has had plenty of time to start addressing these very important matters. The government 'notes' the recommendation that the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission work collaboratively to develop benchmarks on staffing levels and skill mix, which includes the requirements to roster on a registered nurse at all times. The government 'notes' that that's what the committee recommended. How many times does this government need to be reminded, and asked, to fix staffing levels in aged-care facilities? I've lost count, in fact. This is another very important recommendation. I would argue very strongly that, if the government had taken action on these recommendations, it would have addressed a lot of the failures that we see happening right now, particularly if they had addressed the issue of clinical care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These residential facilities are subacute care facilities now, because what we've seen over the years—as I'm sure all the people in this place who take a very deep interest in aged care know—is a gradual move, from low-level care not being provided in residential aged-care facilities any more, to high-level care. What we were seeing before COVID-19 is residents being shuffled into emergency departments and back to resi care. It's like a revolving door. As soon as there's trouble, people are hiked off to emergency care. It very strongly upsets residents, and it very strongly upsets their families. These issues have not been resolved. The government is not resolving the issue around duty of care. During the inquiry there were very strong arguments raised by some providers that, in fact, they were clinical care providers. We are talking about high-level care here, high-level care for residents. This should have been resolved a long time ago, and that has not happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd argue, as I said, very, very strongly, that these recommendations need more than just 'noting'. There's been very little progress in addressing these major issues. There's been very little progress towards fixing the workforce issues that we raised here and that were also raised by the Aged Care Workforce Taskforce chaired by Professor Pollaers, who made, I think it was 14 recommendations. We have not seen a commitment to implementing those recommendations. The government started that task force. They got that operating—while the community affairs committee's previous aged care inquiry, on workforce, was underway; I'm glad the government was so responsive! Again, we haven't seen those recommendations implemented, neither the recommendations from the committee nor those from the Pollaers task force report. There's a litany of failures here. I look forward to contributing to the general business discussion we're having very shortly. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  I rise to take note of the Joint Standing Committee on the NDIS's recently released report on supported independent living. It was quite an extensive inquiry and series of hearings that were held, to the point that the committee made 45 recommendations. I think it's worth noting, though, when we consider supported independent living, or SIL, that it's probably one of the last legacy items from the previous way that disability was funded, often through block funding, now into the National Disability Insurance Scheme and through the NDIA. Obviously, that carries with it a very different philosophy with regard to choice and control. It ensures that participants have the ability to live their best lives under their choices, as opposed to fundamentally getting what they were given. That is what occurred too often in the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to touch on just a few of the recommendations that we made in this report and how I think that there may be an opportunity in the future to go further with these recommendations. Certainly, with the NDIS definitely in its infancy, things will still require tweaking to ensure that people with a disability and their families are receiving the best possible opportunities that the NDIA and the NDIS can deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">SIL was fundamentally a move from the old group home situation. Whilst a number of the states underwent a process to offload their bricks-and-mortar services, unfortunately, these were primarily given to large providers who were previously block-funded. These providers were well known by disability departments at the state government level. This was unfortunate, because many new and more agile providers were not given the opportunity to participate and, secondly, a number of the large, formally block funded providers had form in providing incredibly poor service to their residents. In fact, a number of them had been under investigation previously for mistreating their clients. So, basically, it was disappointing to see a continuation of this under SIL. Certainly, these providers have not necessarily been in line with the choice-of-control ethos of the NDIS. Unfortunately, I think that in a lot of SIL situations we're continuing to see this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to touch on a couple of the recommendations briefly. Recommendation No. 6 is about providing some sort of guidance for families and allowing them more information and choice when it comes to finding a facility for their loved ones. Sometimes finding information can be incredibly difficult. Again, it also impedes on a family's ability to make the best choices for their family member. Recommendation No. 12 says:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is fundamentally different between SIL and every other part of the NDIS is that SIL providers themselves negotiate with the NDIA on what the funding requirements are. They provide the quote and it is all done without the involvement of the participant or their family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other problem with current SIL arrangements is that there is very little choice as to where these people move into shared or individual support. Also, they have very limited ability to choose who they are able to live with. If people have grown up together and move into a SIL environment—a group home environment—they have very little ability to choose to live with each other because of the way the former block-funded, and now SIL funded, providers offer their services. We have made recommendations, under 18, 19, 20 and 21, that more information be available but that there is also support to move residence, that if you are unhappy with your provider then the support is there for you to move.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that recommendations 24 and 25 are some of the most critical recommendations that the report makes. They are ones that I'm certainly going to follow up on and make sure there is movement on. We need to see a separation of the bricks-and-mortar provision and the service provision. That ensures that if you want to own the houses, if you want to own the bricks and mortar, and you fundamentally want to be involved in property management then that's great and that's what you can do. If you want to be a disability service provider and ensure that people have access to the best opportunities in life then you can be a service provider. By allowing the two together there is the sense of punitive threats being made about security of housing if you decide that you don't want to use your housing provider as your service provider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recommendation 27 we also say that there should be a vacancy register, which would assist families further. We also acknowledged under recommendations 38 and 39 that there are issues with access in thin markets. Those recommendations also establish a provider of last resort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to see the commission look at more active monitoring and look at advanced analytics to ensure participants have not been disadvantaged by decisions of SIL providers and have not, in fact, been reinstitutionalised via stealth under the provision of COVID-19. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  This report is a really important topic and a topic that I'm very, very interested in. In fact, it's one of the things that inspired me to stand for parliament. I've got experience in the employment services area, having spent 10 years working across it to see improvements and get outcomes for long-term unemployed Aboriginal people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak on this particular report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Jobactive: failing those it is intended to serve</span>, an important report that's had a look at the employment services system. The employment services system—jobactive, as it's called—is incredibly important. It's a key plank of this government's strategy to assist people to get the skills that they need and the support that they need to address barriers that they might have to employment, so they can get off welfare and, importantly, get into a job. We know how important that is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report has had a look at the system, and the government takes a lot of pride in this system. It's improved significantly over the years, but the government does acknowledge that there is further room for improvement. As I said, it was one of the things that inspired me to come into this place. I feel like it's something that I can contribute to now as a legislator—assisting with the further improvement of the system. We must ensure that we're getting better outcomes, and not just for the investment that the taxpayer is putting into the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We spend, over the life of the contract, about $7 billion on jobactive. We can, indeed, get better outcomes for the taxpayer in terms of the outcomes we could achieve, but also, importantly, we could get better outcomes for the participants in the jobactive system. One of the points that this report goes to, particularly in the government's response, refers to a review that was commissioned by the employment minister, Minister Cash, to have a look at the jobactive system. Before coming into parliament, I was appointed as an expert witness to sit on the panel that was looking at the employment services system. I was appointed as a participant on that panel to look at the system and to see how it could be improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report goes to some of those key recommendations that were made out of the evaluation of the system. Those recommendations have been put in place in a trial that is now underway in Adelaide and also on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales. Ultimately, what this is trialling is a very different way of operating. It's a different way of working with the jobactive system. It's providing a much more flexible opportunity for jobseekers to engage with the system. It's important that we don't just impose upon people or require people, as part of their mutual obligations, to deal with a binary or simple response to their activation. We must ensure that we're requiring people to engage in activities that are going to improve their capacity to get off welfare and, ultimately, into a job. This system that's being trialled is a much more flexible system. It's a points based system of activation. It gives jobseekers flexibility—through various activities, whether it be training, work experience or even searching for a job—to meet their obligations, and that is something worth trialling, and it is being trialled right now in those areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a digital aspect of the trial. There are many jobseekers, particularly those who have only recently become unemployed, who have a lot of skills and just need a little bit of support with access to information so that they can self-service, if you like, to get themselves into a job and get the requisite training and support. So this system is being trialled. The government has actually taken this report, but there is a lot of activity in place already. There is a lot that we are already doing to implement the recommendations from this report. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  I rise to take note of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme <span style="font-style:italic;">NDIS planning interim report</span>. Whilst I note this is an interim report, I would like to acknowledge the work of Minister Stuart Robert, in that some of these recommendations are already being implemented and we are already starting to receive feedback, via the committee, into the benefits that we are going to see through the implementation of these recommendations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The interim report at the moment has made 14 recommendations, and they are based around the planning system of the NDIS. For many families—mine included—one of the most stressful times of year is when you are preparing for your planning meeting. We did make a recommendation in an earlier report about allowing two-year plans. That has come into play. By its very nature, that has reduced by half the number of times people need to go into a planning process, which also then has flow-on effects with regard to staffing and ensuring that people are getting speedy remedies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to discuss some of the recommendations that were made and why they were so significant. One of the most truly disappointing things that you hear from people with a disability or from their families and advocates is the lack of understanding of planners when they go into a planning meeting. As the mother of a child with autism who has done a lot of work in that space previously, I can say that, when you have a planner ask a family when their five-year-old or nine-year-old is going to outgrow autism—which is a lifelong disability—it can be incredibly frustrating, upsetting and disappointing. It also gives that family very little faith that the planner is actually going to understand the impact of the disability, what it means, what it looks like and what supports will be required. So one of the recommendations that the committee made, and the minister has taken this on board, is looking at better training for planners and looking at having disability-specific planners. When 30 per cent of the cohort within the NDIS have autism, it probably makes a bit of sense to have some autism-specific planners—as well as for multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy or whatever it might be. It is important that people have access to people that properly understand their disability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another problem that we were constantly hearing about was the review process of plans—when people were receiving their plans and that the supports were not adequate. But quite often it wasn't the whole plan that was wrong. There might have just been one or two sections that were not quite doing what they were supposed to do, were not quite addressing the issues in the way they should be addressed. One of those issues was that, when people wanted to have a review of their plan, they had to have the entire plan reviewed and this was a lengthy process that often led to delays and lags between plans expiring and new plans being implemented. So we have recommendations addressing that. Allowing people to now review just a part of their plan gives them more security, more assurance, that they can use the other parts of their plan, if they're happy with them moving forward, without feeling that they're putting their whole plan at risk by going through a total review process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a further step, the committee looked at ensuring that participants of the NDIS are able to review their plan before it goes to the NDIA delegate to sign off. This means if there are any hiccups—any little parts that have been missed or accidentally overlooked or where amounts of money have been decreased unnecessarily or there has been an issue with a particular part of the plan—then the participant and their family are able to look at it before it gets signed off. By ensuring this happens, we are looking at reducing the number of reviews that take place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has been incredibly receptive. This is an interim report. We are continuing to look at it, but we are certainly hearing feedback on the ground and through the hearings about the changes that have already come into play, the changes that are already starting to roll out: these changes in planning will make a huge difference to participants and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise this evening to speak once again on a topic that's very close to my heart given both my background with a family farm and that I am so close to this industry. Before coming to this place I was for some time a policy director with the Pastoralists and Graziers Association, where I dealt with both the sheep and cattle livestock industries in Western Australia. I have an obvious affinity and love for the agricultural industries, and the live export industry is a key part of that broader industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I've said this once, I've probably said it a thousand times, and I'm going to say it again: we do not just export livestock; we export the highest animal welfare standards in the world. We export those to our trading partners, who in many cases do not necessarily have the same standards that we have. So, in ensuring that the livestock coming out of Australia are handled through our ESCA System and through world-class facilities with a very careful attention to detail in both the transportation and handling of that livestock, we are exporting the highest level of animal welfare standards to the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is committed, in fact, to growing the value of agriculture by facilitating trade and increasing market access around the world, including a strong and sustainable livestock export industry that underpins the livelihoods of family farms. And it's not just those family farms. I know those family farms well; I was out just last week with my good friend Rick Wilson, the member for O'Connor, in places such as Darkan, Kojonup and Katanning, and I've visited many other farming communities before. It's not just the farming families that seek to preserve this industry with the highest standards. It's the truckies. It's the feedlot operators. It's the yard hands, the stock hands in those feedlots and on board the ships. It's the hay producers, the pelletisers that produce the feed for those voyages. It's the mechanics. It's the shearers. It's the veterinarians that keep the livestock healthy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This industry spreads right throughout regional Western Australia in particular, and it's important to remember that this is a $1.7 billion industry. It supports around 10,000 jobs directly. In the case of the sheep part of the livestock industry, that's mainly in my home state of Western Australia and it's mainly in one federal electorate: O'Connor. It also extends into the federal electorate of Durack, of another good friend, Melissa Price, and there is a small quantity sourced out of South Australia. But the vast majority of the live export trade in sheep comes out of one electorate, and that means it doesn't necessarily have the political muscle. What it does have is the strong support of this side of the house, this side of the Senate and this side of the other chamber. The government is a strong supporter, committed to the economic wellbeing, the sustainability of the live export sector, with the highest levels of animal welfare and with a regulatory regime that is absolutely based on the best available science.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You've got to remember that the vast majority of live export voyages are undertaken without incident. In fact, the most recent voyage that happened during the northern summer moratorium period, under an exemption, had an absolutely outstanding result: 33,341 sheep and a mortality rate of 0.08 per cent. There were 28 mortalities, not one of them attributable to heat stress. I challenge all those who talk about the contents of this independent observer's report and selectively pick from the report to go onto the website and watch the time-lapse footage of the sheep aboard that ship throughout that entire journey. The footage is available, and I would encourage all those Australians who have concerns about the industry to go and watch that footage, because that footage will demonstrate that the welfare of those animals was very well looked after throughout the voyage. It's there for everyone to see.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an area where the industry has grasped the issues they faced in the past couple of years and made significant improvements. They are committed to openness and transparency. That is why, through organisations such as the Sheep Collective and the Cattle Collective, they are publishing extraordinary amounts of information, available to the general public, so that they can see the reality—not the confected reality that some in the activist community want to portray but the reality of what is happening on these live export voyages. You can see this for yourself if you go to the Facebook pages or websites of the Sheep Collective and the Cattle Collective. Together they call themselves the Livestock Collective. You can see the time-lapse footage for yourself, and I would encourage every Australian who has some concerns to go and look at that footage. Don't trust the words of the activists; you cannot.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Exporter arrangements were observed to be implemented during the voyage, and to be compliant with ASEL requirements. The observer stated that the causes of the mortalities were not linked to any systemic failure of the exporter. The observer described that the AAV,— </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">stockpersons, vessel's officers and crew carefully monitored sheep during their daily activity routines and were committed to the positive outcomes for sheep.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And this is not just aboard that vessel; this is right across the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having come from a farming background, having spent many thousands of hours with farmers on farm, in yards, in shearing sheds, I know that the vast, vast, vast majority of this industry is absolutely committed to the highest standards of animal welfare. And anyone who says otherwise is, quite frankly, lying. The industry is committed to improvement, and you can see that in the hard data. If you look at the mortality rate for live export vessels going back over a period of years you see a slow and steady decline in the level of mortalities. You see constant improvement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, the industry has improved its activity over the last two years in the face of some public concern and strong government action, but that is not the industry coming late to this party. It has been on a constant journey of improvement for decades. That is something that I am absolutely committed to making sure Australians understand through my voice in this place. The livestock industry has been committed to the welfare of animals throughout my life and continues to do everything it can to improve standards whilst supplying the highest quality protein to our important trading partners. The industry has demonstrated that it has a strong, ongoing and enduring commitment to the welfare of livestock and to supporting our overseas markets that we've developed over time and which we would leave in a very difficult position if we were to ever even hint at withdrawing from them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, once again, I commend the industry for the changes and the constant improvements they've made over a very long period of time. I look forward to rising in this place at future points to continue to talk on this very important topic.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I also wish to speak on item 728 regarding the vessel <span style="font-style:italic;">Al Kuwait</span>. I regard myself as having a little bit of authority in this area. I'm not only a fully qualified and registered veterinarian; I have been an Australian accredited vet and worked in the live export industry for over 30 years, including extensively in the preparation of livestock for export and also accompanying animals on export voyages. I don't know if anyone else in this place has undertaken livestock export voyages. Certainly quite a few people seem to have quite strong opinions on it, but I would suggest that they probably don't have relevant experience. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the veterinary profession all accept that the slaughter of livestock closest to the point where they originated is the ideal experience so that they are not transported. Again, that's ideal. We also accept that it's not practical. If you are a vegan and you want to have that position and you don't eat meat, that's fine. That's your choice. But for those of us who choose to eat meat it is not practical to have a cow, a sheep, a pig et cetera in our backyard to raise it up and slaughter it. I think we accept that that's just not the situation we live in. Therefore, animals do have to be transported for slaughter. They are transported regularly in Australia, generally by road, from their place of origin to abattoirs. We accept that occurring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The industry of live exports overseas is to fulfil a demand, sometimes by our very close neighbours, for protein, for meat. There are many reasons why livestock are transported live as opposed to being slaughtered in Australia and the product being shipped overseas. One of the reasons is the fact that there's no cold chain in a lot of the countries that we export to and so there's no way to keep meat cold, chilled or frozen. People don't have that capacity in many of these countries and in many of these regions. So they require livestock to be transported alive to close to where people live so that they can be slaughtered and consumed fresh on the day. That's certainly the case throughout a lot of South-East Asian countries, and it's why we export extensively to South-East Asia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a veterinarian involved in the live export industry, I would like to take you through a little of the routine of the industry. Livestock are gathered from properties. They are transported to export hubs, mostly, where they are inspected by veterinarians that are accredited. They are inspected for their health and welfare, and animals that are not fit to travel are pulled out and receive treatment. Depending on where they are from and where they are going to, veterinarians will often conduct blood tests for various diseases, provide treatments for internal and external parasites, and provide vaccinations and so forth according to the protocol. All those animals that are assessed as fit to travel will be transported to the ship and loaded onto the ship, supervised by an Australian accredited stockperson and an Australian accredited vet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once on the ship, there are obviously rules regarding stocking densities for the different species that are transported. They will be housed in pens on the ship. A daily routine is that the stockperson and the vet will separately go around and inspect all of the animals. The stockpeople will pull out any animals that are looking unwell, are distressed or have anything wrong with them. They will be placed in a hospital pen. The veterinarian will then come and assess each one of the animals and assess what treatments are required. These ships carry extensive amounts of veterinary drugs and equipment for treatment of animals, so any animals requiring treatment will be treated by the vet as frequently as is required—that might be once a day or it might be three or four times a day—and they will be re-inspected every day. If any animals die on the voyage, the majority have a post-mortem conducted on them by the accredited vet to assess the reason for them dying, and that that is included in the report. Inspections continue throughout the day and reports are conducted. Independent observers are obviously free to go wherever they like on the ship and observe everything that's happening, and then they report on what they have observed. That's the daily routine of live export.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that it would be ideal to slaughter animals right where they're going to be consumed, with that not being possible, this is absolutely the most humane way that we have to transport animals overseas so that our neighbours and countries we trade with are able to access the same sort of protein and food that we do. Some figures on this industry. Live export produces approximately $1.7 billion yearly to our economy and employs 10,000 or so people directly and indirectly. It's a very, very important industry and a big employer and supporter of families in rural, regional and remote communities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The observer commented that no sheep were observed to be in severe heat stress or distress from heat during the voyage.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 33,000 sheep were on this voyage. There were 28 mortalities. That's extremely low. None of these mortalities were due to heat stress. They were due to things such as liver disease, cardiac disease, infection and organ failure.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also worth noting that there were 103 sheep that were hospitalised and received treatment during this voyage. One hundred and two of these hospitalised animals recovered and were discharged. In a normal paddock situation the majority of these conditions that these animals were hospitalised for and treated for would not have been treated. A lot would not have been identified. They would not have been treated. It is the fact that these animals were inspected so regularly that they were pulled aside, they received treatment and they recovered. I would put to you that if the 103 out of this 33,000 had been at home in a paddock situation many of these animals would have suffered and died due to their conditions. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  The ban on live cattle exports early last decade is the same old, same old, same old Labor Party attacking the agricultural industry in this country. Agriculture is the oldest industry in modern Australia. The sheep and the cattle industries have sustained modern Australia since its inception. But it isn't just the live export ban where the other side of the chamber, the Labor Party, attacks the agricultural industry. This isn't a one-off. It is the same old Labor attacking the true patriots of this country, small business, because they want to destroy the means of production. Whether it be the tree-clearing laws, the reef regulations, the fact that the agricultural department has to recoup costs—does the ABC have to recoup costs? No, of course not—inner-city industry. But if you're from the regions you've got to pay for everything in this country, don't you?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the tree-clearing laws. I want to talk about the tree-clearing laws in particular because in south-west Queensland there are some magnificent regional towns: Charleville, Quilpie and Cunnamulla—that's halfway between south-east and south-west Queensland. Those shires are dying. Those shires are dying because farms are being locked up because of carbon farming. Big organisations are coming in and buying these farms. The farmers are selling out and leaving town. The poor old mayors don't know what to do—Shaun Radnedge from Charleville, Stuart from Quilpie. Interestingly enough about 76 per cent of the carbon credits that have been generated to meet the Paris target emissions come from south-west Queensland. Do those farmers get any credit from the Left? They're the farmers who are doing the heavy lifting in saving the environment—that's of course if you believe the story these guys tell. What I want to know is why these guys constantly ridicule or reject the notion that this side of the chamber and this government are doing enough to meet its Paris commitments, because we are. We've actually reduced C02 emission from 2005 by 411 million tonnes. To reach Paris we only had to reduce by 395 million tonnes. Do you know where that reduction in carbon dioxide has come from? The agricultural industry. The true greenies, the real environmentalists, are of course our farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How does state Labor repay that? They shut down the agricultural colleges. The Queensland state Labor government has shut down the regional pastoral colleges. If you really cared about the environment, wouldn't you want to teach our young and upcoming farmers best vegetation management practices? Wouldn't you be encouraging this stuff? No, no, no. They're just going to shut it down. Why is that? Because they don't want to see farmers succeed in agriculture. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not only tree-clearing laws. It's not only the closure of pastoral colleges. It's not only the closure of maternity wards; Queensland state Labor has shut over 30 regional maternity wards since they’ve come to power. They brought in poker machines. I will give one Labor politician a bit of credit here. Wayne Goss actually came out and said that was the biggest mistake he ever made. He actually said he regretted that. So I give him credit for admitting that was a big mistake. He has passed away now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on. As I mentioned earlier today, the reef regulations are designed to hit the cattle and cane industries. As I said earlier on, if you wanted to play a word association game: 'Cattle and cane. Name the state. It's Queensland.' What do Labor do? They're bringing in regulations that are going to force farmers who could be as far away as 500 kilometres upstream, and might have a few head of cattle, to do a vegetation management plan. If a farmer doesn't do that, they could be fined up to $200,000. Where is the farmer going to find the money to do a vegetation management plan and be able to sleep at night knowing that they're not going to be fined $200,000?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have vegetation management laws in Queensland as well. They stop the farmers from pulling down mulga and all this sort of stuff. If they knew anything about mulga—you've got to pull the stuff down so that you open up the soil, so that when it rains the water falls into the ground and not over the top of it. Anyone who is from mulga country knows that if you actually pull down some mulga after it rains—where does the grass grow? Under the fallen mulga tree. What we've got now is fully grown mulga—because mulga is a quite fast-growing tree; it grows out after 25 years, so it's not actually sucking up any carbon at all. All it's doing is becoming one big fire hazard. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And let's not start on clearing national parks and forests. That's something I can speak about with a great deal of authority, because our family's property is right next door to a national park. Of course, what comes through from the national park all the time? Feral goats, feral pigs, feral dogs. Is the state government looking after our national parks? Of course not. But you don’t need to go to Western Queensland to see that. You've only got to go up to Mount Glorious in Brisbane, up the road from Samford, and you will see all of this lantana everywhere. You won't see lantana on private property, but you will see lantana all over the national parks. Why is that? Because Labor always talk the talk but never walk the walk. </span>
                </p>

A lot of the time, this meat, these animals, will go to Third World countries to feed the people, because some of these Third World countries don't yet have refrigeration. If we could provide cheap power, they would get refrigeration, and I'm sure, over time, it will come. But do we think about Third World countries needing a source of protein? Who has the best source of protein in the world? Australia—the Australian agricultural industry.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the chamber have spoken very passionately on our concerns about the failings of this government in the way that it's dealt with COVID-19, the pandemic and its effect, and the loss of life in the aged-care sector. This morning the Senate required the minister to confront the Senate and address his failings. After he gave his address to the Senate, which in no way reassured any of us, let alone the Australian people, that we could have more faith in this minister, he just turned his back and left the chamber. Instead of staying in this chamber and listening to the debate to at least acknowledge the number of older Australians—in excess of 360—in residential care who have died through his failings, he left the chamber. He may think that he can run away from this issue but he cannot run away from this crisis. He cannot run away from this crisis, and neither can the Prime Minister.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's put a bit of context into this debate, shall we? When elected seven years ago the Abbott government, from the outset, failed to build on the provisions that had already been laid out for building a new foundation for aged care. After years of consultation with the then opposition, former cabinet minister Mark Butler laid out the foundations for Living Better Living Longer. He had worked with the opposition at that time in a unified way, and with the sector, to bring about those changes. The unfortunate thing is that after we lost government we saw, under the incoming Liberal government, under Mr Abbott, a churn of inadequate, uncaring, uninterested ministers being given the portfolio responsibility of aged care, going back to Ministers Andrews, Fifield, Morrison himself, Ley, Wyatt, Hunt and now Colbeck. The very sad thing is that none of the Liberal Prime Ministers, whether Abbott, Turnbull or now Morrison, have given aged care the decency—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator POLLEY:</span>
                  </a>  Madam Acting Deputy President, I did actually use—if you go back and check <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>—'Prime Ministers Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison'. Each one of them failed to give priority to aged care by having its minister in the cabinet. This is an area of huge responsibility. We're an ageing nation. Senator Colbeck, the minister for aged care, comes from my home state of Tasmania. We have the fastest-ageing population, the highest number of people in this country, followed by South Australia. So he should know very well the challenges ahead of this nation when it comes to aged care and the amount of funding that is needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's go back to what happened in 2013, when then Prime Minister Abbott came to office. He cut $1.2 billion, the workforce supplement, to 350,000 aged-care workers—wait for it—18 days after being elected. Eighteen days! That's the priority of the Liberals when it comes to aged care. And let's go on to 2014. The Abbott government guaranteed that there would be a workforce strategy. But guess what? In 2016 the Department of Health confirmed there had been no movement in the development of a strategy. In 2017 Minister Wyatt appointed Professor Pollaers to chair the workforce task force. And what did that task force bring down? Fourteen recommendations in relation to the workforce. And what action has this government taken? None of those recommendations were acted on—none of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when the Prime Minister said there were no warnings of the challenges of the pandemic and the effect on the aged-care sector, it was nonsense—absolute nonsense. There have been warnings from the sector. There have been warnings from the unions. His own task force has warned them. We've seen the same thing day in, day out, with the aged-care royal commission, which this government, this Prime Minister, called into their own failings. But let's talk a little bit about the royal commission into aged care. We have the loss of life in this sector. We have the enormous amount of stress that's been placed on those people who work in aged care. We know already that there is no nationalised standard of training. We know they're underresourced. We know we need a much larger workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what happened around this country when the royal commission into aged care was called was that, when those workers who had their uniforms on went into businesses after they finished their shifts, or onto our trains, our trams and our buses, they were spat on and abused. That's how those workers were treated when the royal commission was called into this sector. That was totally unacceptable. And what we've seen now is this government trying to shift the blame as to what's happening in aged care. They don't want to accept any responsibility for it. Well, I'm sorry, but when it comes to being a minister of the Crown and being Prime Minister of this country, the buck stops with Minister Colbeck and the Prime Minister when it comes to aged care. The Prime Minister of the day has been, up until recently, standing by this minister's incompetence until he started to take away the responsibilities that this minister had in dealing with this pandemic and the effect of it on the aged-care sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, in the other place—in the House of Representatives—on five occasions the Prime Minister failed to stand up and support the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians. It's extraordinary, absolutely extraordinary! But, then again, the hallmarks of this government and this Prime Minister are a lack of accountability, a lack of transparency and no integrity. They don't deliver; they make a lot of promises, they put out media releases and they get in front of the cameras, but they actually don't deliver. And they do not take any responsibility—it's always someone else's fault.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the minister kept saying it's Labor's fault and that we're playing politics. Well, I, and people on this side of the chamber, will never apologise for standing up for the most vulnerable people in this country. At this point in time there are families who have lost their loved ones because of the incompetence of this government and because when the Prime Minister was Treasurer he gutted the aged-care sector and now won't take any responsibility for it. He's still trying to spin that, saying, 'Oh, no, we didn't take it; I didn't cut any funding.' Nonsense! Their budget papers reflect exactly that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something to be said for a minister who comes into this chamber and apologises for his or her failings. They get some points for that and they get some respect for that. Things happen. But to deny the resources and the money that is available? Even when we talked about the question that I asked today of the minister, about the $205 million that was allocated for training and PPE, there was no accountability there. 'We don't have to wait for the audit.' Really? We're in a pandemic now. The fact is that staff were told they could have two masks to use for the day, or just one glove. I don't know why they couldn't have two gloves. Maybe the minister might be able to answer that next week? Maybe we can find out. Maybe there are only one-armed people working in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very, very serious situation. This pandemic is by no means over; that means that the government of the day is responsible—it's responsible for those people who are in residential care. I have no doubt, no doubt at all, that there's not a person in this chamber who would have wanted to see anyone pass away in residential aged care due to COVID-19. But we had warnings when it came to Dorothy Henderson Lodge and Newmarch House; those warnings were very evident and the government still failed to act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's own lacklustre performance does nothing to instil confidence in his ability to handle the portfolio. Already the Prime Minister has demonstrated that he doesn't have confidence in the minister to do his job, so how can the Australian people have confidence in this minister when his own Prime Minister fails to have that confidence in him?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need is for the Prime Minister to take the action necessary to ensure that there is a minister who is capable of dealing with the challenges in the aged-care sector at this point in time.</span>

                  </a>  Senator Siewert and I have sat on many inquiries into the aged-care sector—and also you, Senator Duniam; you have sat in on those. We've had many discussions, you and I, about the concerns around aged care, so it's not like people weren't aware and haven't been aware for some time. That's why Mark Butler had to work with the opposition of the day to try and rebuild. He set the foundations, but consecutive Liberal prime ministers have failed to address and carry on that very important work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the minister to say that the opposition haven't provided any suggestions in relation to the solutions that are needed, well, Senator Bilyk and I know very well that Julie Collins, the shadow minister for aged care, has spoken on many occasions to the minister and offered, as I did when I was the former assistant minister, to work with former Minister Wyatt. We were ready and willing at any time, but the minister of the day has to be able to comprehend what direction needs to be taken and to listen to that advice. If he were a smart minister, he would be working with the opposition today to resolve these issues because it's too important. It is too important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A question has been asked on more than one occasion here today, and that is: if your mother or father or grandmother or grandfather was faced with having to go into aged care at this point in time, would you put them into residential care with this incompetent minister at the helm? I think we all know the answer, and it would be no. That's regrettable because the people who work in this sector believe in what they're doing but they need more resources. We need more staff. The challenges are only going to get greater over the next couple of decades. So we have to resource them. We have to support them. We need this government and we need the Prime Minister to step in, put in a minister who's capable and make sure that minister is a cabinet minister so they can fight for the resourcing and the funding that is needed around the cabinet table instead of putting in a junior minister that isn't up to the job. That's the sort of action that needs to be taken. We can't wait until Christmas for the annual reshuffle that no doubt is going to happen this year. We need that action. The Australian people need that action if they're going to have faith in the aged-care sector again and have any faith in this government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  I rise to make a very short contribution to the general business debate this evening. The Australian government is determined to ensure a safe environment exists in aged-care facilities as we work together to contain the spread of COVID-19. This has been an extremely difficult time for Australians as we continue to deal with this contagious virus, and we offer our deep condolences to those families who've lost loved ones. The government is working with aged-care providers and state and territory public health authorities to support arrangements to manage infection control and COVID-19 outbreaks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This virus is highly infectious, and we have seen how rapidly it can spread through communities when people come into contact with someone who has the virus. We only need to look at the spread through communities here in Australia and see the devastating impacts the virus has had on countries across the world. The Australian government understands that we need to do everything we can to prevent COVID-19 from spreading to vulnerable Australians. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the federal government has announced funding of more than $1 billion in new measurers to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 on aged care. As a government we've been building our response to COVID-19 in residential aged care since January this year. Overall, the Morrison government is delivering record investment across the aged-care system over the forward estimates, from $13.3 billion in 2012-13 under Labor, growing to an estimated $25.4 billion in 2022-23. That is close to double.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has been working with the aged-care sector along with state and territory governments and their respective authorities to assist with our response to the impact of the virus on aged care. Importantly, we are incorporating learnings not just from our own country's experience but also from looking at what is happening overseas. As long as community transmission is occurring in Australia, we will continue to face significant challenges in aged care and we will continue to do everything we can to stop the spread and protect older Australians.</span>

                  </a>  'Hear, hear!' from Senator Watt. There are 64 days for Queensland to change, because Labor have been in power for 25 of the last 30 years. In fact, they've been in power for 2,100 days in their latest iteration. So I think it's good that, this week, Deb Frecklington of the LNP released their Economic Recovery Agency 100-day action plan. Labor have been in power for so long and have done nothing. They're like Sir Snooze-a-lot, this government! They like to snooze and they like to nap. They are a government that has done nothing for Queensland except slowly send it backwards.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a Labor government that is using coronavirus as an alibi to cover up its incompetence and its mismanagement of the Queensland economy. For those who are listening at home, before coronavirus came along, Queensland already had the highest level of bankruptcies in the federation, already had the lowest level of business confidence, and already had the highest level of unemployment in the federation. That is because of the economic mismanagement of Senator Watt's mates in George Street. We had that wonderful Treasurer Trad, who was very, very good at making sure that things happened close to properties that she had bought. Former Minister Trad is now hiding under a doona in her place, waiting for the Greens to take her seat.</span>

First of all, we're going to deliver the Bradfield scheme—Bradfield 2.0. We going to catch all those metres of rain that fall in the Far North and we're going to turn parts of Queensland where there is limited rain but really good soil into food bowls. We're going to set up the Queensland Dam Company. We know you've got to build dams in Queensland, because all this rain gets flushed out to sea and nothing good comes of it. Talking about flushing water out to sea, let's talk about Paradise Dam. It's not just that Labor in Queensland is not building dams. The one dam that has been built in the last 20 years is Paradise Dam, and they're actually taking it down. Those of you who are listening won't believe this. In the middle of the drought, they flushed the water out to sea.</span>

                  </a>  Exactly! Senator Duniam has said, 'What?' In Senator Duniam's home state, they've built 16 dams in the last 20 years, yet the one dam there is in Queensland has got a giant hole in it thanks to Labor's mismanagement. Here's a fun fact: the bloke who was in charge of building Paradise Dam is now the guy who is in charge of building Cross River Rail, so be worried about making sure those Cross River Rail tunnels are properly sealed, ladies and gentlemen. We're going to do an immediate audit of all of the stalled projects in Queensland. There are hundreds of stalled projects because this Labor government is not very good at making decisions. They don't like making decisions. In fact, they're the world experts at not making decisions. They get the gold medal for it. We're going to make sure that all these stalled projects are audited. Then we're going to get them moving again, because we want to fast-track these projects in Queensland. There is so much potential in Queensland and it is being wasted by Labor. We're going to make sure that the approval of the second M1 will be fast-tracked because, at the moment, the M1 is a car park that occasionally moves. That is how bad the traffic congestion is.</span>

And guess what? There are going to be no new taxes under an LNP government, and there won't be any increased taxes under an LNP government. We have Sir Taxalot over there, and Lady Taxalot and Lord Taxalot, and all of the taxing Labor MPs. They love taxes. Nine taxes in Queensland have either been increased or brought in, just in the last few years. There are only 64 days to get rid of this tired Queensland Labor government and to get Deb Frecklington as Premier, so we can get Queensland moving again.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  I rise to speak on a more serious matter. As someone who has suffered the devastation of a stillbirth, I understand that parents who experience this tragedy need support to recover. Thirty-seven years after my baby Timothy was a victim of this national health crisis, I'm shocked by the snail's pace of progress in giving parents of stillborn babies the support they need. There is still a lack of understanding about what parents of stillborn babies go through. Losing a child through stillbirth is just as painful as losing a child who survived the birth. With the proper support, parents can make progress in recovering from the immediate emotional trauma, but the grief of losing their baby will always stay with them. While Australia has been slow to acknowledge the reality of this national health crisis, there is progress nonetheless, and tonight I would like to share some good news with the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Monday the Commonwealth Bank announced that they would increase paid parental leave entitlements for parents of stillborn babies to bring leave entitlements in line with those for parents with a live birth. Primary carers working for the bank who experience the tragedy of a stillbirth will be entitled to 12 weeks of paid leave and secondary carers will receive four weeks of paid leave. The Commonwealth Bank's decision demonstrates their understanding that parents of stillborn babies are still parents, and they are entitled to paid leave to fulfil their duties as a parent. After the shock of the loss of their baby, parents must make decisions for a funeral, probably an autopsy, and a burial or cremation—all while still grieving. Just like a mother of a live birth, a mother of a baby who is stillborn still needs time to recover physically from the birth. All parents who go through this tragic experience need time to grieve the loss of their baby. The Commonwealth Bank joins several other large employers who have recognised the long-term social and economic benefits of paid parental leave for parents of stillborn babies. These employers include Australia Post, Bendigo Bank, Bunnings, Deloitte, KPMG, National Australia Bank, Optus, PwC and Woolworths. There are also a number of others, and you can find a full list on the Stillbirth Foundation's website: stillbirthfoundation.org.au.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The corporate sector is leading the way and it's past time for the government to catch up. According to the Stillbirth Foundation, there are an estimated more than half a million Australian workers covered by these leave entitlements, but there are millions more who are not covered. The government must adopt the recommendations of the stillbirth Senate inquiry and make changes to the Fair Work Act and the National Employment Standards to provide consistency across all employers and employees in Australia. While Labor welcomed the government's announcement in February that they would extend unpaid leave for parents with a stillborn baby to 12 months, the government have yet to implement this change, six months later. Every day six babies are born still in Australia. In six months, that's over 1,000 families whose lives have changed forever. Once again, the government are big on announcements but fall short of delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also continue to call on the government to make bereavement payments equal for parents with a stillbirth. It makes no sense that parents whose baby's heart beats once after birth receive this payment, while those whose baby is born without a heartbeat don't. I might point out, once again, that parents with a second or subsequent stillbirth only receive half the amount of the stillborn baby payment they receive for their first. Let me tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett, the funerals don't get any cheaper. The Stillbirth Foundation estimates the total cost of these two changes, to the bereavement payment and stillborn baby payment, to be about $2.5 million a year. This is a small price to pay to ensure that parents of stillborn babies receive the financial support they need and deserve to help rebuild their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to quickly thank my Labor colleagues, in particular Senators Keneally and McCarthy, for their work with me on the stillbirth Senate inquiry and for their ongoing advocacy on this issue. I'd also like to thank our shadow minister for health, Mr Bowen, and Leigh Brezler and her team from the Stillbirth Foundation. The Stillbirth Foundation is a 100 per cent community funded organisation which keeps on kicking goals for stillbirth research and lobbying efforts on behalf of the thousands of families who have suffered the trauma of stillbirth. But the government needs to take some action. As I said, every day in Australia, six babies are stillborn. The government announced this program six months ago but hasn't done anything—over 1,000 families' lives changed forever.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  In this difficult and challenging year, as my friends in Melbourne endure the hardest of winters and my friends in Sydney are advised daily of a list of places whose visitors must get tested and self-isolate, our lives, for most in Western Australia, are close to normal. They are close to normal because our state government—Mark McGowan's government—took early and decisive action to protect the people of WA and close our borders. They closed our borders against the wishes of the Morrison government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the Morrison government joined forces with Clive Palmer in a legal action to force Western Australia's borders open. Joining forces with Clive Palmer—it's a phrase that never should be used about any government. Clive Palmer is a hypocrite, a narcissist, an egomaniac and a threat to our nation's democracy. He is a shifty businessman who lists litigation as a hobby. Clive Palmer also recently dismissed the coronavirus as a media beat-up. This is a man facing charges for fraud and dishonest use of his position as a company director. He has been accused by ASIC of illegally funnelling millions of dollars into his 2013 election campaign—charges that carry a five-year prison term. This is the man that the Morrison government and the Attorney-General, Christian Porter—himself a Western Australian—threw the entire weight of the Commonwealth legal resources behind. Then, only after the damage had been done, the Commonwealth tried to back out and wash its hands of the affair. But this week's judgement in the Federal Court confirms that this government's support in the Clive Palmer case remains on the record, just as this government's opposition to border closures remains on the record and just as the court confirmed that the border closures have saved lives and kept the state safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, again in the Senate, we've seen senior WA minister Minister Mathias Cormann talking about open borders and talking about hotspot management. This was right here in the Senate. If hotspot management is enough and border closures are unnecessary, why did the Liberal Premier of New South Wales close the borders to the people of Victoria? It was because you cannot control a pandemic if you don't control the people that bring it in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard a lot from this government about the hardship of border closures. They do cause hardship—it's true. But there would be a lot less hardship, a lot less difficulty for border communities and a lot less distress for people trying to work out how to get back to their homes, their jobs, their families and their loved ones if we had a consistent plan for a national system and if the Commonwealth government had stepped up and supported states and territories in putting a system in place right from the beginning, as was necessary. Instead, it was doing everything it could to denigrate the leaders who took that hard but necessary step. This government has done everything in its power to destroy those life-saving protective measures. Those opposite—the government—might want to forget that they linked arms with Australia's shonkiest businessman in a full-throated attack on Western Australia, but I can tell you: the people of Western Australia will not forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  In all Australian states and territories, kids as young as 10 years old can be sent to prison. I don't know how many times I need to say it in this place, but I'll say it again: children do not belong in prison. Australia is seriously out of step with the rest of the world, the medical community and human rights standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended 14 years as the minimum age of criminal responsibility. The science shows that children under 14 years of age lack impulse control and have a poorly developed capacity to plan and foresee consequences. Children in grades 4, 5 and 6 do not have the cognitive development to be held criminally responsible for their actions. There are a high number of kids in our youth justice system, and many have mental health issues and cognitive impairment. Research from 2018 found that nine out of 10 young people in youth detention in my home state of Western Australia were severely impaired in at least one area of brain function. Young children in the justice system also have high rates of pre-existing trauma. Criminalisation and imprisonment only contribute to their pre-existing trauma. Separating children from their families through detention is extremely harmful to children's health and development. How can we lock up these kids when they don't have the cognitive ability to understand the consequences of their actions?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018-19, more than 570 children under 14 years old were placed in juvenile detention. Sixty-five per cent of these children were First Nations children. First Nations children are overrepresented at every stage of the criminal justice system. When Australia locks up children as young as 10, it has a devastating impact on First Nations communities. In some places, First Nations children are being stopped by police, put in handcuffs and thrown into cells at up to 43 times the rate of non-Indigenous children. What kind of life are we setting up these children for? Children deserve to be nurtured in their families and communities. Children need to be at school. They need love and support, not handcuffs and prisons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a responsibility in this place to do what is in the best interests of children. Raising the age of criminal responsibility will make our communities safer and give kids the best possible chance of a good life. Raising the age of criminal responsibility is in the best interests of all children in Australia, especially First Nations children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take a moment to commend community leaders, especially the work that's being done by Change the Record and NATSILS in their relentless campaign to raise the age of criminal responsibility. Their campaign increased in momentum ahead of the meeting of the Council of Attorneys-General in July. I know how disappointing it was to hear that the council decided to again delay making a decision on the age of criminal responsibility—this time until 2021. I'm deeply concerned that next time they'll make the decision to delay it for another year, and then another year. If the council had decided to raise the age, this would have immediately reduced the level of incarceration of First Nations children by at least 17 per cent. We have missed an opportunity to make real change. This decision shows just how out of touch governments across this country are when it comes to this critical issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both international and national evidence shows that locking up kids does not keep the community safe or reduce future offending. So why are we doing it, and what should we be doing instead? We need to start by raising the age of criminal responsibility to at least 14 years old. The ACT Greens leader, Shane Rattenbury, paved the way this month by introducing a motion that committed the ACT government to raising the age of criminal responsibility in the ACT. The Legislative Assembly voted in favour of this motion, which is a first for our country. States and territories are now being forced to go it alone because the Commonwealth has been too slow to act. Once again, the Commonwealth is failing to show leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's juvenile justice system is based on a false economy. The financial burden of keeping young people in prison is huge. In 2017-18, youth detention cost the government more than $509 million. This money would be much better spent on early intervention, prevention and rehabilitation services and programs which address the underlying causes of criminal behaviour and prevent future offending. Now is our chance to reimagine our justice system by implementing justice reinvestment and diversionary programs. These approaches are much more effective in keeping kids out of the justice system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen firsthand the work being done in Bourke by innovative community leadership in their justice reinvestment program. It's an incredible example of an innovative approach to community based intervention. It works by addressing the causes of offending before it begins. It's working across the community. Police, non-government organisations and, very importantly, the tribal council, led by elders in the community, are working together to address this problem. It demonstrates what can be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Punitive approaches do not work. They entrench disadvantage. How can we be serious about justice targets and closing the gap if there is no commitment to raising the age of criminal responsibility to at least 14 years of age? Ensuring that First Nations children are not imprisoned or having to go through the trauma of the criminal justice system will go a long way to also getting adults out of prison and, in fact, adults not being in prison. I urge all governments to look at the leadership being displayed in the ACT. We should take urgent action to stop young kids from going to prison by raising the age of criminal responsibility as soon as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Raising the age of criminal responsibility was a recommendation of the royal commission into the Northern Territory youth justice system. We are leaving it far too long since we saw those recommendations to ensure that we are taking action. There are many other actions recommended in that very impressive report. There are many recommendations that are not being implemented, and the Commonwealth continues to wash its hands of responsibility. It is not good enough. We need leadership from the Commonwealth to ensure that we are moving much more quickly than years down the track, which is what the process is at the moment. We need to be acting now to raise the age of criminal responsibility so children do not end up in our criminal justice system.</span>
