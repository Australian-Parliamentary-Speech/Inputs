                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Private Health Insurance Amendment (Income Thresholds) Bill 2021 implements a measure announced in the 2021-22 budget. It will provide continuity for the current policy settings by continuing the pause on the indexation arrangements for income thresholds in the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 for a further two years, and updates the indexation arrangements to apply to the current thresholds from 2023-24. The income thresholds contained in the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 are used in determining the tiers for both the private health insurance rebate and the Medicare levy surcharge. The rebate and surcharge will continue to be income tested. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government invests over $6 billion each year in the private health insurance rebate which contributes to the affordability of private health insurance for Australians. Following significant reforms over recent years which have made private health insurance simpler and more affordable, the 2021-22 budget sees the Australian government continuing to increase overall spending and investment in health. This includes investing in ongoing reforms to private health insurance which to date have resulted in the lowest annual average premium change for consumers since 2001—2.74 per cent. Specifically in the 2021-22 budget the government is investing $30.6 million over four years to continue to make private health insurance simpler and more affordable for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians continue to rate the quality of health care available in our country at near record high levels but are concerned about the system becoming overstretched. Private health insurance continues to be viewed by Australians as a vital element of the health system, providing choice and helping to relieve pressure on the public system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill supports ongoing reforms in private health insurance. More than half of the Australian population have some form of private health insurance. Income-tested rebate arrangements are a foundation stone of these arrangements and continue under this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill preserves the explicit link between the rebate and the Medicare levy surcharge. It makes no changes to the Medicare levy surcharge rate or the private health insurance rebate rates. This is important as they operate together to ensure that people whose rebates are reduced because of means testing continue to have a strong incentive to retain their private health insurance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that these changes over the next two years will not affect individuals with an income that remains below current base tier thresholds of $90,000, or couples and families with an income that remains $180,000 or below. Higher income earners without private health insurance will continue to be subject to the Medicare levy surcharge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly the bill will ensure the recommencement of annual indexation from the current income thresholds following the end of the pause, which is important for the continuity of policy settings and predictability for government financing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides stability regarding access to the private health insurance rebate and application of the Medicare levy surcharge. During this pause the government will undertake a detailed study into the settings of these two important private health insurance policies to ensure they provide the appropriate incentives for individuals, couples and families when choosing the healthcare cover that best suits their circumstances.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Home Affairs is proposing fit-out works as part of its consolidation of leased office space in Sydney. Home Affairs currently occupies three buildings in Sydney—two in the Sydney central business district and one in Parramatta. The leases are due to expire in 2022 and 2023, with no options to extend. Under the Home Affairs Sydney precinct strategy, the consolidation of these three sites into a single site in Parramatta will provide operational efficiency and flexibility to allow the change in future business requirements and will reduce overall property operating costs. The estimated costs of the works is $25.2 million. The works must be referred to, considered by and reported on to both houses of the parliament by the Public Works Committee before work may commence. Subject to parliamentary approval, fit-out works are expected to commence in November 2021 and scheduled to be completed in mid-2022. I commend the motion to the House.</span>

Yet five diseases still exist where the DVA do not accept the Factor: 'that must as a minimum exist before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting (specific disease) with the circumstances of a person's relevant service is; On land in Vietnam At sea in Vietnamese waters, or On board a vessel and consuming potable water supplied on that vessel when the water supply had been produced by evaporative distillation of estuarine waters for a cumulative period of at least thirty days, at least five years before the clinical onset of (specific disease).' </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Falun Gong is a peaceful meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance. Millions of Falun Gong practitioners in China have been fired, jailed, tortured or killed by the Chinese Communist regime since July 1999. There have been persistent reports of systemic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in China, primarily practitioners of Falun Gong. The Independent China Tribunal, chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, concluded in its Final Judgement in 2019: "Forced organ harvesting has been committed for years throughout China on a significant scale and that Falun Gong practitioners have been one - and probably the main - source of organ supply" and that crimes against humanity against Falun Gong have been proved "beyond reasonable doubt". </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to request the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and Australian Government to: 1. Pass a motion or make a statement to openly request an immediate end to the persecution of Falun Gong in China and the immediate release of all Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience; 2. Urge China to immediately end the practice of organ harvesting from all prisoners of conscience and conduct a thorough public education campaign to ensure Australians do not unknowingly participate in forced organ harvesting in China; 3. Deny visas and bar entry to Chinese officials and policeman who are involved in the persecution of Falun Gong.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The housing market is currently overpriced due to a number of factors (low interest rates, population growth, Investors/negative gearing benefits, Covid govertment grants being used for deposits etc)</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Banks are also allowing an unlimited number of applicants to apply for home loans adding more pressure on the heated market.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Single people are often driven out of the market by couples and couples are often burnt out by having overcommited to a 30 year loan agreement and in most cases mums and dads required to work their whole lives and facing issues such as mental health issues, physical stress and in cases unable to provide sufficient time and care to their children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is also a negative effect on the ecomomy as both parties working and contributing 90% of their income to the mortgage and little to none is put back into the ecosystem via spending at businesses etc.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to work with APRA and impose restrictions on Lenders to only allow a sole borrower on all loans as this will immediately half the amount being leant and in effect half the price of all houses. This will also free up the second income earner to spend money on the ecomony and stimulate growth or free up more time for family.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

For many older voters, issues such as education can become merely a talking point and nothing more. For younger people however, the quality of our education can greatly affect our future and the people that we become. With our education holding so much influence over our futures, we should have a say in how the education system is run, and the easiest way to do that is by allowing young people to chose who represents their interests in parliament. Education is only an example, as there are many issues such as issues of equality and casual wages that affect many young people, people who ultimately have no say over any policy in these areas. Granting 16 and 17 year olds the right to vote can also increase engagement in our democracy. Ultimately, this change will greatly increase the size of the electorate, which means means more people who get their voices heard, and a parliament that more accurately reflects the people it represents, which can only strengthen our democracy</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Child Support Agency continues to hurt Australian families. The scheme does not represent Australian democratic values of democratic liberalism. Specifically, the scheme reinforces the alienation of fathers from their children post separation. The Child support Scheme manufactures debt and uses draconian measures to collect from payers, who are 85-90% men. Key legislative components used to manufacture debt need to change; such as: 1. Assessing paying parents using their gross income yet collecting from after tax monies 2. Income assessment and change of assessment rules 3. Number of night rules 4. The relevant dependent amount 5. Address all legislative elements that serve to create indirect discrimination toward paying parents. 5. Abolish tax refund interceptions and garnish notices when a payment plan is in place. The scheme has always been controversial and continues to be. Financial coercion is not the answer. The Australian government needs to reflect on its values and its role to libertarian principles of small government. Urgent reform is needed. The Child Support scheme is a failure and needs to be recognised as such and contributes to poor mental health and wellbeing of fathers and is correlated to the high male suicide rates. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On November 4, 2020, the Ethiopian government led by Abiy Ahmed Ali declared war on the Tigray Region. Since then, the Ethiopian federal army and allied forces from the Amhara region, along with the Eritrean army have waged an atrocious war on Tigray that has forced over 2.2 million people to flee their homes, with over 61,000 civilians fleeing to neighbouring Sudan. The atrocities include: 1) Indiscriminate shelling, civilian massacres, and extrajudicial killing 2) Weaponized hunger - Weaponized sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls 3) Destruction of UNESCO world heritage sites and mass looting. Australia's bilateral relations with Ethiopia have been active for 56 years. Ethiopia has been represented by an ambassador in Canberra since December 2013. An ambassador of whom is indirectly endorsing the state-sponsored genocide in Tigray by remaining silent. </span>

The Department of Finance list both of these companies as recipients of Commonwealth funding. After the election Mr Dutton declared he had "renounced" his family trust and was not a beneficiary. Mr Dutton's wife and children are beneficiaries of the trust and the Commonwealth money given to that trust through the two child care centres.

              <span class="HPS-Small">There is no clear evidence that those 'vaccines' are effective. The m-RNA in the 'vaccines' is allegedly protected against the natural body enzymes that break m-RNA's (RNA-ases). Whilst the American CDC assures the public that they don't enter the nucleus of cells to change the DNA, their resistance to these enzymes means that they can persist in cells indefinitely. In effect, the outcome of such longevity is similar to changing the DNA. Furthermore, the synthetic m-RNA in the 'vaccines' can enter sex cells, passing down adverse side effects to future generations. The Swiss and other governments have banned, restricted and/or are reconsidering their use.</span>

Cases of the same has been reported in Sydney of physical assault and in Melbourne that of a threat.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The war has been going on in the Democratic Republic of Congo since 1996. The main cause of this war is the illegal exploitation of minerals such as coltan and cobalt needed to manufacture technological devices such as smartphones, iPads and computers. As a consequence, people in Congo are victims of serious crimes against humanity. Several civilian populations have been displaced or massacred; more than five million people have been killed; children are subject to slave-like labour conditions and women are being raped. The progress of technology means that cobalt will be in high demand in the near future. Some developed countries are planning to fabricate only electrical cars from 2030. Electrical cars will need rechargeable batteries made with cobalt. More than half of the cobalt used in the world comes from the DRC. This future demand for cobalt constitutes a high risk of increased atrocities against local populations in Congo. The only way to prevent this is to have past crimes punished and victim's rights restored.</span>

The Australian Government has supported Afghanistan through decades of war. Still, as peace talks seek to end the violence, hundreds of Afghan human rights defenders, journalists, and media workers have been deliberately targeted and killed. These attacks undermine the importance of freedom of speech, human rights, and the foundation of a lawful society. </span>

Afghan women lawyers, judges, educators, students, political analysts, civil servants are extremely vulnerable. Many have already been displaced from their roles in several provinces or killed. The deliberate killing of civilians is contrary to international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes.

              <span class="HPS-Small">For millions of years, the frozen Arctic Ocean kept our world's weather patterns balanced, ensuring we all have the food and water we need to survive. But the oldest and thickest sea ice has declined by 95%. In its wake are emerging threats like buried pathogens and methane in nearby permafrost, that could sicken us all and/or destroy our global economy. In addition, businesses perceive Arctic open waters as pathways for oil and gas, fishing, militarization and shipping, without understanding the true cost of doing so in natural disasters, food shortages, refugees, economic and political turmoil, and mass extinction. Antarctica has been protected from exploitation for decades by the Antartica Treaty system. According similar protection to the North Pole, the Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary Treaty transforms the Arctic Ocean into the world's largest preservation area for the benefit of all life. No region, nation, or species is separate in our world. All life is interconnected and interdependent, and as such, there is no such thing as "someone else's problem". This has become clearer than ever in light of the global coronavirus pandemic. All human lives, including those of Australian citizens, are at risk due to the loss of the Arctic ice and the impending exploitation of the Arctic Ocean.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Although the vast majority of the economy is experiencing a strong V shaped recovery, the Aviation Industry continues to be the subject of extensive restrictions and volatility. Government agencies have signalled that the closure of international borders will likely continue further into late 2021 and possibly beyond, despite the impending vaccine roll out. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">International border closures, although effective against the virus, have caused an almost total collapse of the aviation sector and restricted our ability to trade. These closures have only been compounded by the patch work approach to opening and closing of state and territory borders over the past 6 months. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the industry first effected by the pandemic and likely the last to be unimpeded; our industry is uniquely disadvantaged, and our recovery will no doubt move at a different pace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Recently the industry, in a joint open letter, has urged the Prime Minister to extend JobKeeper payments for aviation workers and to continue to support the industry until we can operate without restriction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is our firm belief that we are a resourceful and essential industry sector which provides stable and long term employment to its workers and are the backbone of economic growth in Australia, but while borders are closed our ability to operate as a viable and sustainable industry is smothered and restricted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to implore the Government to provide support to our employees by either extending JobKeeper or by offering a specific Aviation Industry wage subsidy and rescue package.</span>

The Australian government should provide the outcomes of Covid-vaccinated citizens within 28 days of receiving the vaccine for the same period of 15 months before making any legislation, or making any rule that infringes civil rights or the Geneva convention.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The current eligibility requirements of the Remaining Relative Visa (Subclass 115) are unfair at best and racist at worst denying a group of Australians (citizens by conferral) the right to reunite and live alongside their parents and siblings unless that group is prepared to wait for years or pay a fortune. If every Aussie is entitled to a Fair Go, then every Aussie is entitled to having parents and siblings in his or her life without having to meet ludicrously unreasonable conditions such as the ones in the Remaining Relative Visa.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Not only could a Remaining Relative Visa take years before it is granted, but it also requires that neither applicants nor their partners have near relatives living outside Australia erecting almost insurmountable barriers for Australians by conferral to enjoy the same rights that, say, 2nd or 3rd generation Aussies enjoy - living with family: parents and siblings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While it is certainly sensible for the Australian government to demand that citizens sponsoring family members demonstrate their ability to provide care and support to them, it is grossly inhumane to deny a group of Australian citizens and their immediate family members still living abroad, especially the ones who need rescuing, the right to be with each other merely because the remaining relative's partner still has a near relative living outside Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">The corporate practices of Jetstar, is particularly aggressive and misleading. Victims are being coerced into receiving credit vouchers, so as to nullifying refund claims. Victims are being pressured in resolving complaints that contravene acceptable consumer protection.

              <span class="HPS-Small">A Petition is circulating on a private platform stating ''for the third consecutive poll, the number of Australians reporting they'll refuse the covid vaccine is rising.'' It is true that social media feeds are flooded with conspiracy theories and reliable information about covid-19 and the questions around the vaccine. But it is up to the people to decide what is reliable information and what is not. The circulating petition claims that ''only the tech giants know the full picture of how this misinformation is polluting our newsfeeds. But they won't share this information with health experts.'' There is no lawful requirement for social media companies to share social media posts with alleged medical experts, it is up to a person's local GP, to inform a person/patient about whether or not, a covid vaccine is right for them, and to educate their patient about covid where that person can make an informed decision, not a group of medical interlopers who spy on &amp; police social media posts.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to consider not giving access to the ''Live List'' to Health Experts, giving access to the same birds eye view of trending covid related posts that Facebook or Youtube has. It may violate &amp; interfere with implied rights to political communication and free speech, and gives them special access the rest of the public does not have, which is discriminatory, their interference will allegedly violate Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as to interference.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We are petitioning you on behalf of Australians living off the National Minimum Wage. The Fair Work Ombudsman specifies that as of 1 July 2020 the National Minimum Wage is $19.84 per hour. The Australian Bureau of Statistics 'Employee Earnings' specifies that as of August 2020 the median hourly earning in Australia was $36 per hour (or $71,136 gross annually for 38 hours work per week). But for someone earning the National Minimum Wage their gross annual pay for 38 hours work per week would be only $39,203.84.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to please take action to reduce poverty. We appreciate the Fair Work Ombudsman's regular reviews of the National Minimum Wage, however we are petitioning for it to be raised to $20 per hour. This would be a difference of only $0.16 per hour - $6.08 per week, which is $12.16 per fortnight, and $316.16 annually. To the Hon. Speaker of the House of Representatives and Members of the House of Representatives, we ask if sixteen cents is too much to help reduce poverty in Australia? We ask that if the House approves this petition, that it is put into effect in all Australian states and territories within two years of its approval. We thank you for taking the time to consider this petition and look forward to your response.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As of May 2020, approximately 750,000 students were enrolled in ELICOS courses in Australia, a similar number to those enrolled in VET and higher education. ELICOS accounts for approximately 23% of GDP gained from international students. In addition to the immediate financial benefits, one must consider the long-term contribution to the economy. Students who start their Australian journey in an English language course often progress to VET courses or tertiary education. Many continue along the path to eventual permanent residency, but even those who return to their own country will have established strong and enduring ties to this country. At each step, they are putting money into the Australian economy. Australia has thus far navigated the coronavirus pandemic far more successfully than other major international student destinations such as the UK, the United States and Canada. We are thus poised to re-establish ourselves as the country of choice for overseas students. But where will they study? Who will teach them? Training centres are closing at an alarming rate and experienced teachers are being forced to search for employment in other sectors.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to continue Jobkeeper payments for those employed in the ELICOS sector beyond March 31st in order to keep schools open, keep teachers employed and help to ensure that the sector is ready and able to deliver excellent education to international students from day one. This represents a sound investment in Australia's future.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020 originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning JobSeeker and JobKeeper (Petition number EN1732). Your correspondence has been referred to me for response. I apologies for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">JobSeeker Payment provides income support to those looking for work or who temporarily cannot work or study because of an injury or sickness. It strikes a balance between supporting individuals while maintaining incentives for recipients to support themselves to the greatest extent possible. The social security system aims to support people back into the workforce, be targeted to those most in need and be fiscally sustainable to ensure a safety net reminds in place for future generations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to temporary, targeted and scalable support during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Coronavirus Supplement was introduced from 27 April 2020 to provide additional financial support to eligible income support recipients, such as JobSeeker Payment, during COVID-19. The amount of the Supplement has been adjusted to reflect gradually improving economic conditions. Until 24 September 2020 the rate was $500 per fortnight. From 25 September to 31 December 2020 the rate was $250 per fortnight. From 1 January to 31 March 2021 the rate is $150 per fortnight.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The JobKeeper Payment was designed to ensure eligible employees remain connected to their workforce. The scheme was always intended to be temporary to cushion the economic impact of COVID-19. As conditions improved, the employee reference date was changed from 1 March to 1 July 2020 and the payment was further targeted. The payment is scheduled to end on 28 March 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the economy moves to a recovery phase, the JobMaker Hiring Credit is a key part of the Government's JobMaker Plan. It will help young people access job opportunities and rebuild their connection to the labour force as the economy recovers. The JobMaker Hiring Credit incentivises businesses to take on additional employees that are young job seekers aged 16 to 35 years old.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 15 February 2021 concerning Petition number EN2048 for Vitamin D services. Please find information below in respect to each matter raised.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                <span style="font-style:italic;">I. Introduce a government-subsidised national Vitamin D (and other critical nutrients) supplementation program.</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to providing all Australians access to safe, effective and affordable medicines. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is the main mechanism through which the Government can subsidise the cost of medicines for the treatment of Australian patients. The Government subsidises a comprehensive range of medicines through the PBS, including over 5,200 branded products to treat a wide range of medical conditions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government cannot list a new medicine on the PBS, or change the circumstances of an existing listing, unless recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). The PBAC is an independent, expert body, which advises the Government about PBS matters. When considering a medicine proposed for PBS listing, the PBAC uses a rigorous Health Technology Assessment methodology to evaluate applications and is required to consider the effectiveness and cost of the medicine, including by comparison with alternative treatments. The PBAC's consideration is generally initiated by the pharmaceutical company responsible for a medicine making an application for PBS listing. This is because the pharmaceutical company usually holds the scientific data and other information necessary to inform the PBAC's consideration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Vitamin D supplements are over-the-counter medicines, available without a prescription. In general, pharmacy medicines that do not require a prescription are not listed on the PBS, as they are inexpensive and, after applying the pharmacy remuneration charges for dispensing, the cost of these products to the Government when accessed via the PBS is disproportionally inflated.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Pathology testing for Vitamin D is currently subsidised by the Government under the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), which is part of the wider Medicare Benefits Scheme managed by my Department and administered by Services Australia. In the 2019-20 financial year, the Government provided $104 million in Medicare benefits and supported over 4 million services for Vitamin D testing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">MBS Items 66833, 66834, 66835 66836 and 66937 provide an MBS benefit for Vitamin D testing in individuals at risk of Vitamin D deficiency. The items were introduced in 2014, replacing the previous items that supported Vitamin D testing, to best ensure the item descriptors align with clinical guidelines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, pathology testing for a range of other critical nutrients are also currently MBS subsidised. For example:</span>

              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is the Government's lead agency for funding health and medical research. NHMRC distributes grants through a range of schemes with specific aims, e.g. to invest in people with outstanding research achievement and promise, to support the most innovative research to solve complex problems, and to meet specific strategic objectives. Most NHMRC funding is awarded in response to investigator-initiated applications and is not directed by NHMRC to any specific disease, health or research topic. A small proportion of funding is directed to specific areas of unmet need, e.g. through Targeted Calls for Research (TCR) and other special initiatives. The primary criterion for all funding decisions is excellence. NHMRC relies on rigorous, competitive peer review that identifies the best science and most significant research.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 2011-2020, NHMRC provided funding of over $1.2 billion for research related to nutritional diseases, including over $82 million for research into nutritional deficiencies and supplements. NHMRC provides support for research related to epidemic and pandemic preparedness through a number of grant schemes. In particular, the Australian Partnership for Preparedness Research on Infectious Disease Emergencies (APPRISE) Centre of Research Excellence was awarded a five-year NHMRC grant from 2016-2021 to build national research preparedness for major infectious disease outbreaks. In 2020, a further $2 million was awarded to APPRISE to undertake rapid research in direct response to the COVID-19 emergency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst it cannot commit to funding increases in these areas, the NHMRC continues to welcome research grant applications across the health and medical research spectrum. The NHMRC will also continue to consider and prioritise new TCR topic proposals from community and professional groups, as well as from states, territories and the Australian Government, in accordance with established processes. Further information on NHMRC grant schemes and processes can be found on NHMRC's website at: www.nhmrc.gov.au.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, nutritional medicines are regulated as therapeutic goods under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 </span>(Act) by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The TGA is responsible for ensuring that therapeutic goods available for supply in Australia are safe and fit for their intended purpose. This is achieved through a risk-based system whereby medicines are broadly classified as either 'listed' (low-risk) or 'registered' (high-risk) based on the ingredients they contain and the therapeutic indications (claimed health benefits) they use. Medicines approved for supply are entered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) and can be identified by AUSTL or AUSTR identification numbers on the labels. The TGA is not involved in business decisions relating to the sale of products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, medicines indicated to prevent or treat COVID-19 are regulated as prescription medicines, which must be prescribed by a GP. These registered medicines, which are generally higher risk and intended for serious conditions or diseases, undergo a full pre-market assessment to ensure they are safe, of high quality and effective for their intended use.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In contrast, complementary medicines, which include nutritional medicines, such as Vitamin D and other micronutrients, are generally regulated as lower-risk listed medicines, which are available for self-selection at pharmacies, supermarkets or health stores etc. Listed medicines are not able to be indicated for or refer to the treatment, prevention or control of serious diseases, such as COVID-19, and are not subject to a pre-market assessment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Nutritional medicines and other medicines that are marketed as lower risk listed medicines can only contain pre-approved, low-risk ingredients and only make pre-approved low level indications that are supported by appropriate evidence. Although these medicines are not evaluated before being released on the Australian market, the supplier must legally certify at the time of market approval that they hold appropriate evidence to support the claims being made. If, during a post-market compliance review of any listed medicine in the market place, this certification is found to be false, then compliance action can be taken to correct any misleading information associated with the listed medicine or the product may be cancelled from the ARTG.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A new category of lower risk medicines that is also available for nutritional medicine products is assessed listed medicine (identified on the label with an AUSTL(A) identification number). This category of medicine is also available for self-selection at pharmacies, supermarkets or health stores etc; however, such products are able to carry higher level indications than those permitted for use in standard listed medicines. To ensure this category of medicine remains lower risk (than registered medicines) assessed listed medicines undergo a pre-market assessment of the evidence to support the efficacy of the proposed indications for the product. These products may claim on their label that the product has been 'TGA assessed'.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN2149 - stop all non-Australian citizens from being able to own any land or property within Australia. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Foreign investment drives economic growth, creates skilled jobs, improves access to overseas markets and enhances productivity. Without foreign investment, production, employment and income would all be lower.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, the Australian Government recognises community concerns around foreign ownership of certain Australian assets including residential real estate. The foreign investment review framework allows the Government to consider these concerns when assessing Australia's national interest while ensuring Australia remains an attractive place to invest. If it is determined that a proposal is contrary to the national interest, it will not be approved, or conditions will be applied to safeguard the national interest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to residential land, under Australia's foreign investment review framework foreign persons generally need to apply for foreign investment approval before purchasing residential real estate in Australia. The Government's policy is to channel foreign investment into new dwellings, as this increases the total dwelling stock in which Australians can live, creates additional jobs in the construction industry and supports economic growth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with this aim, applications to purchase new dwellings are usually approved without conditions and applications to purchase vacant land are normally approved subject to construction being completed within four years (to prevent land banking).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Non-resident foreign persons are generally prohibited from purchasing established dwellings in Australia. However, reflecting the fact that foreign persons who are temporary residents need a place to live during their time in Australia, temporary residents can apply to purchase one established dwelling to use as a residence while they live in Australia. The purchase of an established dwelling in these circumstances would normally be conditional on the foreign person selling the property when they leave Australia. Temporary residents cannot acquire established dwellings to rent out or for use as a holiday home.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to agricultural land, this is a sector in which the Government has acted to improve scrutiny and transparency around foreign ownership. The Government has clarified that foreign investors can only acquire agricultural land where there has been an open and transparent sale process - thereby ensuring Australian bidders have equal opportunity to participate in a given sale process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may be interested to know that comprehensive reforms to the foreign investment review framework came into effect of 1 January 2021. These reforms update the framework in three broad ways: they address national security risks; strengthen the existing system, particularly as it relates to compliance by foreign investors; and streamline investment in non-sensitive businesses.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning <span style="font-style:italic;">Petition EN2166 </span>- <span style="font-style:italic;">request to reduce the tax on tobacco products. </span>Your correspondence has been referred to me as I have responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government discourages the use of all tobacco products as there is no form of tobacco use which has benign health effects for consumers. Despite the recent decline in the incidence of smoking, it remains a leading cause of preventable death and disability in Australia, with smoking estimated to have killed almost 21,000 Australians in 2015.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The World Health Organisation identifies price increases through taxation as one of the most effective ways governments can reduce tobacco consumption. Successive Australian governments have made significant efforts in recent years to reduce tobacco consumption through staged increases in tobacco excise and a swap to wage indexation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The taxation of tobacco products, apart from discouraging smoking, helps to pay for support for people who wish to quit smoking, essential services such as the delivery of health services and other areas of spending that benefit the whole Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government supports a range of services designed to help people quit, including the My QuitBuddy and Quit for You - Quit for Two mobile apps, and confidential support and advice through the Quitline (13 78 48). In addition, certain smoking cessation products are subsidised on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Further information about quitting smoking can be found on the Department of Health website at: www.health.gov.au/health-topics/smoking-and-tobacco/how-to-quit-smoking.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 15 February 2021 concerning petition EN2168 - request to extend eligibility criteria for the Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) Initiative.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is aware of the significant impact diabetes has on people with diabetes and their families, and is committed to working towards the broad prevention of the disease in the Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CGM Initiative began in 2017, and provides fully subsidised CGM products to eligible people. Since that time, the eligibility criteria have been expanded to allow more people to benefit.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 2 February 2020, I announced changes to the eligibility criteria that will result in more than 20,000 additional people having free access to CGM products.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The changes allow all people with type 1 diabetes aged 21 years or older who have concessional status to access CGM products, removing the requirement for these people to be assessed as having 'high clinical need'. This change will increase the total number of people eligible for CGM products to over 58,000.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Also, on 1 March 2020, the Freestyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring system was added to the range of products subsidised under the CGM Initiative. This increases options for eligible people with diabetes in managing their condition.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government provides considerable additional support to people with diabetes, including those people not eligible for the CGM Initiative. The Government subsidises essential medicines, like insulin, under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and diabetes-related products through the National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS).</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">To be eligible for support from the Boosting Cash Flow for Employers measure, entities are required to have (on or before 12 March 2020) an Australian Business Number and evidence of an active business. The evidence can be either of assessable income in a 2018-19 tax return, or of supplies, such as sales, that occurred in a tax period applying to the entity that started after 1 July 2018 and ended before 12 March 2020. Typically, entities have provided evidence of supplies by lodging activity statements in line with standard reporting procedures.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate that as a result of the design of the measure not every business will be eligible, however, this requirement is an important integrity feature to prevent schemes designed to artificially access support from this measure.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN2193 relating to petrol prices. Your correspondence has been referred to me as I have responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to continue to monitor fuel prices in Australia. In its recent reports, the ACCC has found that the key factors affecting fuel prices remain international crude oil and exchange rates. For example, increases in international oil prices typically lead to increases in domestic petrol prices. Its most recent report can be found at: www.accc.gov.au/media-release/australian-petrol-prices-higher-but-still-below-pre-pandemic-levels.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Petition EN2193 appears to raise concerns about petrol price cycles. Petrol price cycles occur when prices oscillate between high and low points. Typically, prices steadily fall for a period followed by a sharp increase. The ACCC's website provides information on petrol prices cycles and gives buying tips: www.accc.gov.au/consumers/petrol-diesel-lpg/petrol-price-cycles#petrol-price-cycles-in-capital-cities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The level of competition between fuel retailers is also very important. To help drive competition, the ACCC recommends that consumers take advantage of fuel price websites and mobile applications that allow them to select the best time to purchase fuel, as well as the cheapest location</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Parliamentarians who joined the Parliament on or after 9 October 2004 are covered by superannuation arrangements under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Parliamentary Superannuation Act 2004 </span>(the Act). As provided under the Act, parliamentarians are members of fully funded accumulation schemes and are entitled to the superannuation employer contribution rate of 15.4%. Parliamentarians who joined prior to this time are entitled to a defined benefit pension on retirement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The level of parliamentary superannuation employer contributions needs to be considered in the context of the total remuneration package for parliamentarians.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 August 2020, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN1587 - Medicare Levy. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand the petitioner's concerns that all Australians should pay their fair share of tax and Medicare levy. In Australia, a resident's income tax liability - for most taxes and for Medicare levy - is based on taxable income, after deductions are taken into account.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A basic principle of the Medicare levy is that it applies to an individual's taxable income from all sources. The fact that taxpayers are required to pay the Medicare levy on taxable Government assistance payments they receive—just as taxpayers are required to pay the Medicare levy on any wage and salary income—is consistent with this basic principle.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, low-income earners are not liable for the Medicare levy. This is consistent with the progressive nature of income tax, which means those on lower taxable incomes pay less tax. The Medicare levy low-income thresholds ensure that households do not pay Medicare levy if their taxable income is below a certain level, and the amount payable is phased-in over a certain income range. These arrangements ensure that the liability of people to pay the Medicare levy reflects their financial capacity to contribute to the total cost of national health care, and is not merely a payment for service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government considers the current Medicare levy settings to be appropriate.</span>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN2208 - <span style="font-style:italic;">request to remove petrol and diesel excise indexation.</span> Your correspondence has been referred to me as I have responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Fuel excise is paid on all fuel manufactured in Australia or imported into Australia for home consumption. The Australian Government uses revenue from excise, including fuel taxes, to fund essential services that all Australians receive benefits from, such as the delivery of social services, defence and security, road funding and numerous other areas of spending of benefit to the whole community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government passed legislation to reintroduce the indexation of fuel excise to inflation. From August 2014, fuel excise increases twice a year, in February and August, in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). These are the same arrangements that were in place before indexation was frozen in 2001. Alcohol and tobacco excise, like fuel excise, are also indexed twice a year, in line with the CPI.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Implementing this important structural fiscal reform contributes significantly to the Government's efforts to build a stronger, more prosperous economy. Every additional dollar raised by the increase in fuel excise from indexation is linked by law to the funding of roads. While the impact on individual households is modest, this measure provides a predictable and stable source of revenue, which will help the Government boost its investment in road infrastructure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government provides fuel tax credits for fuels consumed by a subset of fuel end-users. These are currently equal to 100 per cent of the fuel excise amount charged on the fuel consumed by these eligible users. To see if users are eligible for fuel tax credits, please refer to: www.ato.gov.au/Business/Fuel-schemes/Fuel-tax-credits---business/.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is aware that businesses in the event industry were among the first affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, through the closure of borders and domestic restrictions to keep Australians safe. In recognition that events providers are operating in an exceptional set of circumstances due to COVID-19, the Government announced on 11 September 2020, a $50 million Business Events Grants Program to support businesses in the sector. On 11 March 2021, the Government announced that it would extend the program for three months and make changes to the program guidelines so that more businesses are eligible to benefit.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also recently announced that it will expand and extend its existing SME Guarantee Scheme to support the economic recovery, and to provide continued assistance to firms currently on JobKeeper. The SME Recovery Loan Scheme will benefit from an increased government guarantee, allowing lenders to offer a 24 month repayment holiday, longer loan terms, larger loan sizes and the ability for borrowers to refinance existing debt.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These programs are in addition to the Government's significant economic support for businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. JobKeeper was a key feature of the Government's response, with around $86 billion in JobKeeper payments made over the two phases of the program to date. In addition, the Boosting Cash Flow for Employers measure has provided around $35 billion in cash flow support to eligible businesses.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More generally, businesses in the events industry will benefit from the economy recovery that is now well underway. The strength of the domestic economic recovery over the second half of 2020 and in early 2021 has consistently exceeded the expectations of most economic forecasters. In particular, the labour market has recovered quickly, with the unemployment rate falling and workforce participation returning to around record high levels. The vaccine roll-out is also gathering pace, supporting domestic borders to remain open and providing greater certainty for people to travel for both business and leisure purposes. Nevertheless, the Government is mindful that some parts of the economy, such as the events sector, remain impacted by ongoing health measures and border closures and will continue to monitor economic conditions closely to see if further action is required.</span>

We continue to negotiate new free trade agreements, including with the European Union and the United Kingdom. These build on the existing agreements the Government has secured including those with Japan and South Korea and the recently signed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 30 November 2020 to Senator the Hon Zed Seselja, the former Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities, and Electoral Matters. I am responding as the Assistant Minister for Electoral Matters.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that petition EN2011 requests that the <span style="font-style:italic;">House stop any elected Member of Parliament of any political party to move/join another party or be independent without a by-election at their own expense.</span></span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 10 December 2020, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM) tabled its report from the inquiry into the conduct of the 2019 Federal Election. In relation to by-elections and a sitting Member of Parliament (MP) resigning or leaving a party, the JSCEM recommended the Government consider further deliberations by JSCEM on:</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 3 December 2020 concerning petition number EN2026 outlining your support to amend the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (Code) to allow companion animals in non-food preparation areas of food premises.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2012, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) examined the risk of companion dogs in outdoor dining areas under Proposal P1018 Companion Dogs in Outdoor Dining Areas. This proposal did not assess the presence of companion dogs or other animals inside food premises in non-food preparation areas. In August 2012, FSANZ approved the proposal and amended the Code to allow companion dogs in outdoor dining areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Code permits assistance animals, such as guide dogs, to be present in dining, drinking or other areas of food premises used by customers. Although these animals may pose a risk to food safety, this risk is reduced because assistance animals are trained to follow a set of standard behaviour in public areas. Companion dogs that are not trained to this level may present a higher food safety risk.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If you wish FSANZ to make a change to the Code you need to submit a formal application to FSANZ. All applications undergo public consultation and a structured assessment process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on changing the Code can be found at: www.foodstandards.gov.au using the search term 'Changing the Code'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 15 February 2021, requesting a response to petition EN2030, which asks the House to replace swivel chairs with fixed chairs that face the other side of the House. The reason given for the request is to make it difficult for the Prime Minister to turn away from debate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the House, Members are allocated seats and are expected to address the House from their own places. The Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition are allocated the seat on either side of the Table at the centre of the Chamber and speak from the despatch boxes at the Table.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is a convention that a Minister should be present in the Chamber at all times, and in practice Governments maintain a roster of 'duty Ministers' who are not only in charge of items of government business but can react with authority on behalf of the Government to any unexpected development. When other matters are before the House—for example, during private Members' business, or adjournment or grievance debates—it is expected that a government representative will be available to take note of or respond to matters raised.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Duty Ministers sit at the Table in the Prime Minister's seat. Similarly, it is customary for the Opposition to maintain a roster of frontbenchers to sit at the Table, in the seat allocated to the Leader of the Opposition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the Table, swivel chairs are very practical. They make it easier for the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition or the Members on duty, to rise to speak from the despatch boxes on items of business or raise points of order. Their mobility also facilitates the changeover between duty Ministers and the Prime Minister or shadow ministers and the Leader of the Opposition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The chairs themselves have an identical design to those in the committee rooms of Parliament House. The architects nominated these chairs, which are off-the-shelf items with custom finishes, for use in the committee rooms because of their design characteristics. They were selected for the Chamber in line with the precept of setting a unified design character within the building by using as few different furniture designs as possible.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention and I trust this information will be of assistance.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 15 February 2021 to the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, regarding petition number EN2031, which asks that the House of Representatives call a referendum to create an Australian republic. The Prime Minister has asked me to respond on his behalf. I apologise for the delay in responding to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A move to a republic, with an Australian Head of State, would require a change to the Australian Constitution through a constitutional referendum. The process for altering the Australian Constitution is set out in section 128 of the Constitution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Prime Minister has expressed his support for current constitutional arrangements. As you may be aware, any proposal to amend the Australian Constitution needs widespread community support to succeed. I add that, contrary to the suggestion in the petition, under the current constitutional arrangements, Australia is a sovereign, independent and federal nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Government respects the right of all Australians to continue to express their views on these matters.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 regarding Petition Number EN2033 on Australia's commitments to the United Nations (UN) and Paris Agreement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's national interests, security and prosperity are served by a stable international order based on pragmatic and principled international cooperation among sovereign states. COVID-19 has demonstrated that the international order, underpinned by the agencies and bodies of the United Nations, is vital to address and coordinate a global response to a global challenge.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's international engagement is guided by our national interests, including both our bilateral and multilateral engagement. The 2020 audit of Australia's engagement with the United Nations affirmed that multilateral institutions create rules that are vital to Australia's security, interests, values and prosperity. These institutions regulate international cooperation in key sectors including civil aviation, maritime transport, intellectual property, telecommunications and agriculture, among others, and promote universal values, such as human rights.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Climate change requires a global solution , with countries acting together to reduce emissions. Australia is committed to the Paris Agreement, the central international agreement on climate change which seeks to limit global warming. The Paris Agreement has near-universal support, with 191 parties having ratified or accepted the Agreement and having put forward emissions reductions commitments under the Agreement. Australia has welcomed the United States decision to re-join the Agreement in February 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is an active and constructive participant in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, where we are working alongside other countries to pursue strong transparency requirements for all countries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to meeting its Paris Agreement target to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Australia beat its 2020 target by 459 million tonnes and we are on track to meet and beat our 2030 Paris target.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the year to September 2020, emissions were 510.1 million tonnes - 4.4 per cent or 23.3 million tonnes lower than in 2019. This is the lowest level since 1995. Australia's emissions are now 19.0 per cent below 2005 levels, which is the baseline year for our 2030 Paris Agreement target.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is taking real and meaningful action to reduce emissions, with more than $5.6 billion committed to new emissions reduction measures through the last two federal Budgets. Australia's Technology Investment Roadmap will guide $18 billion of Government investment over the next 10 years to leverage $70 billion of new investment in Australia in low emissions technologies by 2030. Our plan will support 130,000 jobs by 2030 and avoid in the order of 250 million tonnes of emissions by 2040.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Investing in low emissions technologies will enable Australia's continued success in meeting and beating our emissions reduction targets. I assure the petitioners of Australia's continued commitment to influence and shape global institutions, while also safeguarding Australia's national interests.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 to the Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management, the Hon David Littleproud MP, concerning Petition EN2059 - an end to Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs). Your correspondence was forwarded to me as I am the assistant minister responsible for the matter you raised.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government considers that management of Australia's native forests should achieve a balance between the positive social and economic outcomes for regional communities provided by forestry, and environmental outcomes, such as protection for native species and their habitats. The government views RFAs as the most effective way of achieving this balance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">RFAs are long-term agreements between the Australian and the relevant state governments for the sustainable management and conservation of Australia's forests. Through the development of the RFAs the Commonwealth accredited each state's system of legislation, policies, codes, plans, agreements, management practices and the associated compliance regimes to deliver ecologically sustainable forest management.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Within RFA regions, forestry operations conducted in accordance with RFAs are exempt from the Commonwealth assessment and approval requirements of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</span> (EPBC Act), except where operations are within World Heritage or Ramsar wetland sites. The inclusion of RFA provisions within the EPBC Act recognises that in each RFA region a comprehensive regional assessment was undertaken to address the environmental objectives of the EPBC Act.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A key outcome of the RFAs was the establishment of a Comprehensive, Adequate and Representative (CAR) reserve system. Since the RFAs were signed, the area of native forest in conservation reserves in RFA regions has almost doubled - from 5.4 million hectares to 10 million hectares in 2019. These areas have been reserved based on identification of environmental values such as old-growth forest and threatened species. Other areas were identified as potentially being available for harvesting. In these areas, state governments have responsibility for forestry operations and must ensure these are conducted in accordance with the principles of ecologically sustainable forest management.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Between 2017 and 2020 the Australian Government has delivered extended RFAs. To inform the extension of the RFAs, the Australian and relevant state governments completed a further assessment of forest-related environmental, social and economic values in the RFA regions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The extended RFAs provide a modernised approach to forest management, with improvements including:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">rolling 20-year extensions to the RFAs, implemented when both parties agree that performance has been satisfactory (with the exception of Victoria's RFAs, which have been extended to 2030)</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 enclosing Petition EN2074 concerning an exemption from Australia's travel restrictions for parents of pregnant women and women in post-partum period to travel to Australia. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the Minister for Home Affairs as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, to protect Australians from the outbreak of COVID-19, the Australian Government has progressively announced travel restrictions that limit travel to Australia. Until further notice, there is a prohibition on all foreign nationals seeking to travel to Australia, unless they fall within certain exempt categories or have been granted an individual exemption by the Commissioner of the Australian Border Force, Mr Michael Outram APM, or authorised decision-makers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The travel restrictions have been successful in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Australia, and were implemented on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst I acknowledge the concerns raised through Petition N2074, these restrictions are in place to protect Australians from the potential health risks posed to the Australian community by international travellers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commissioner's guidelines available to decision-makers and publicly available on the Department of Home Affairs' website notes that travel exemption requests for individuals seeking to visit a close family member who is seriously ill, where there is little support in Australia would generally meet the inward exemption requirements. However, inclusion of any additional exempt categories will be a process informed by the expert health advice of the AHPPC.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You will also no doubt be aware of the Government's priority to ensure all vulnerable Australians currently overseas are able to return to Australia as soon as possible.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Due to the limited quarantine capacity across all states and territories, and associated restrictions on international flight numbers, it is imperative that international travel into Australia is limited to journeys that are for exceptional circumstances only.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on travel exemptions is available on the Department's website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au. These measures are temporary and are reviewed regularly.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN2074 to my attention.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 16 February 2021 regarding a petition on international passenger arrival caps.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Passenger arrival caps at Australia's major international airports were put in place by the Australian Government in July 2020, following urgent requests from the States to assist with the management of international passenger arrivals given major pressures on their quarantine capacity. These caps were agreed by National Cabinet and currently limit the national total number of international passenger arrivals to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">International air passenger arrival caps are subject to ongoing review by National Cabinet, which is committed to supporting additional capacity on scheduled international commercial services for returning Australians where quarantine capacity allows and the public health advice is that it is safe to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also put in place an arrangement with the Northern Territory Government to provide significant additional capacity at the Howard Springs quarantine facility near Darwin, which is enabling the operation of a number of Government facilitated flights helping vulnerable Australians return, the first of which arrived on 23 October 2020. The Government has also announced an additional 20 facilitated commercial flights over the period to 31 March 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians who remain overseas are encouraged to subscribe to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) website at www.smartraveller.gov.au for the latest advice and follow the social media account of their closest embassy, consulate or high commission for regular updates. Should they require urgent assistance while overseas, they can also contact the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 from anywhere in the world. Australians overseas in need of consular assistance can also register with DFAT via covid19.dfat.gov.au.</span>

As the Minister responsible for the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), I am providing a written response to this petition to be considered by the Standing Committee on Petitions (the Committee).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS does not discriminate against people with disability seeking to access the NDIS based on the type of disability a person may have. Access requirements are set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 </span>(NDIS Act), including age, residency and disability or early intervention requirements. For the purposes of meeting the disability or early intervention requirements, the presence of an underlying condition, illness or injury is irrelevant. Rather, a person will be eligible for the NDIS if their disability is, or is likely to be, permanent and significantly affects their ability to undertake activities of communication, social interaction, learning, mobility, self-care or self-management.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petition raises a decision made by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) in respect to a particular person. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on that individual case, or the decision made by the NDIA in respect of other any individual. Rather, I encourage all persons to pursue their right to review, including external review, should they feel a decision made by the NDIA about them is wrong.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In March 2019, the Government committed to strengthen the <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Act 1988</span> (Privacy Act) by increasing penalties and enforcement measures, and introducing a binding code for social media and other platforms that trade in personal information online. The code will require platforms to cease using or disclosing an individual's personal information upon request, strengthen requirements to be transparent about data sharing, and introduce specific rules to protect the personal information of children and other vulnerable groups. The legislation will soon be released for public consultation </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Separately, in December 2019 in response to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's Digital Platforms Inquiry, the Government committed to a review of the Privacy Act. The review is considering whether the Privacy Act effectively protects personal information and provides a practical and proportionate framework for promoting good privacy practices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In October 2020 the Attorney General's Department released an issues paper for the review, which included consideration of whether a 'right to erasure' should be introduced into the Privacy Act. Consultation on the issues paper closed 29 November 2020, but a further opportunity to comment will be available following the release of a discussion paper expected in the first half of 2021. Further information about the review is available on the Attorney General's Department website, ag.gov.au/integrity/consultations/review-privacy-act-1988.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 15 February 2021, concerning Petition EN2084 - calling for a Royal Commission into Social Media and introduction of new laws that protect freedom of speech.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to promoting the rule of law and the rights and protections we enjoy as a democratic nation. Of these, our right to free speech and free expression is one of the most highly valued and fiercely protected. The ability of citizens to speak freely and openly is the hallmark of a robust democracy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, there has never been an absolute right to free speech in Australia. Free speech is balanced against other considerations, such as whether speech is threatening, offensive or defamatory. The Government's position is that measures to filter, block or 'take down' content on social media websites should be used to protect users from harm, such as by removing online abuse material; or to remove material relating to serious criminal activity, such as content that represents an incitement to violence, or is child exploitation or child sexual abuse material.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Major digital platforms sites, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, also have terms of use that govern how users and others interact with them. Social media platforms are private corporations and are well within their rights to enforce their own terms of use and policies, which users agree to by using their service. It is a decision for the company to determine whether an account or piece of content is in breach of a company's policies and how it will respond. However, the Government expects social media platforms to consistently enforce their standards - which includes taking down harmfully misleading or illegal content.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition raises particular concerns with censorship of political discussion, particularly in relation to the United States of America's (US) 2020 presidential election. Social media website providers have made statements that they have flagged or censored user-generated content when that content breaches the website's terms of use, including by spreading misinformation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government supports actions by social media website providers to combat misinformation. Following the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's Digital Platforms Inquiry in 2019, the Government directed industry to develop and implement an industry code of conduct to address disinformation and misinformation on their services. The Digital Industry Group Inc. (DIGI) developed the voluntary Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation (Code) on behalf of the Australian digital industry and released the Code on 22 February 2021. The Code has been adopted by Twitter, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Redbubble and TikTok, with other digital platforms also encouraged to sign up. Further information on the Code is available on the DIGI website, digi.org.au/disinformation-code/.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Australian Consumer Law</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN2101: Remove Australian Consumer Law (ACL) section 61(4). Your correspondence has been referred to me as I have responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the petitioner has noted, professional services supplied by qualified architects and engineers do not receive consumer guarantee protection under section 61 of the ACL. In that section, there is otherwise a guarantee that services supplied to consumers will be fit for any particular purposes that consumers make known to the supplier. The same guarantee also provides that services will be of such a nature, quality, state or condition, that they might reasonably be expected to achieve a result the consumer makes known to the supplier (or another party with whom they negotiate to acquire the supplier's services).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Services supplied by qualified architects and engineers have had a longstanding exemption dating back to an equivalent provision in the former <span style="font-style:italic;">Trade Practice Act 1974</span>. Parliament originally regarded these professionals as a special category because their relationship with consumers in developing designs and specifications are subject to implementation by third parties, such as builders, and that they should not be held responsible for the actions of those other parties.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A similar rationale was provided when the ACL replaced that Act, but several other factors were noted, including that removing the exemption might increase insurance costs; architects and engineers often experience difficulties ascertaining the wishes of consumers when contracted to provide services; and consumers are adequately protected by other sources of redress.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the latter, if architects or engineers do not render services with due care and skill, they will be in breach of the consumer guarantee at section 60 of the ACL. This guarantee has no equivalent exemption for architects or engineers because it is targeted toward the specific actions of suppliers and not of other intervening parties. Consumers can also pursue a common law action in negligence if an architect or engineer owes a duty of care to the consumer and has failed to meet the standard required by that duty.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are no plans at this time to amend the ACL to remove the exemption. In this regard, I note that the ACL is jointly administered by the Commonwealth and each of the states and territories under the Intergovernmental Agreement for the Australian Consumer Law. As such any proposals would require approval by Australia's Consumer Ministers following regulatory impact assessment. Ministers have recently agreed on other high priority tasks, which can be found at: www.consumerlaw.gov.au/consumer-affairs-forum/communiques/meeting-12-0. However, I have asked my department to raise this matter with state and territory officials as a potential issue for exploration when future priorities are considered.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 15 February 2021, requesting a response to petition EN2102 relating to the e-petitions website for the House of Representatives. The petition asks the House to update the petitions facility on the Parliament of Australia website to pre-fill signing details of a person signed in to the site and to enhance the website to display which petitions have been signed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The e-petitions system, officially introduced in 2016, enables members of the public to submit and sign petitions online and also shows the progress of petitions as they are presented, referred to Ministers and responded to.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently there is no option to sign in to the e-petitions system, which is separate from the 'My Parliament' system. That system allows people to sign in, lodge submissions, track inquiries and stay in touch with updates to content on the Parliament's website.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The e-petitions system was designed to enable petitioners to sign a petition easily, without needing to log on or sign in. There is no option for people to see which petitions they have previously signed. However, when a person signs an e-petition, the system uses the signatory's email address to conduct automatic checks to make sure they have not previously signed that petition.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 enclosing Petition EN2115 concerning seeking to exempt work visa holders to travel to Australia. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the Minister for Home Affairs as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, to protect Australians from the outbreak of COVID-19, the Australian Government has progressively announced travel restrictions that limit travel to Australia. Until further notice, there is a prohibition on all foreign nationals seeking to travel to Australia, unless they fall within certain exempt categories or have been granted an individual exemption by the Commissioner of the Australian Border Force, Mr Michael Outram APM, or authorised decision-makers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The travel restrictions have been successful in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Australia, and were implemented on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, temporary visa holders are free to leave Australia at any time. However, temporary visa holders seeking to re-enter Australia will require an exemption from the travel restrictions before they travel, unless they are in an exempt category.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Temporary visa holders seeking to leave and then return to Australia, may apply for an inwards exemption before they leave. More information about applying for a pre-emptive inwards exemption is outlined in the Commissioner's guidelines issued to decision-makers and are publicly available on the Department of Home Affairs' website at:</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst I acknowledge the concerns raised through Petition EN2115, these restrictions are in place to protect Australians from the potential health risks posed to the Australian community by international travellers. Inclusion of any additional exempt categories will be a process informed by the expert health advice of the AHPPC.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You will no doubt be aware that protecting the health of Australians and bringing Australians home, especially vulnerable Australians, remains the Government's priority. Due to the limited quarantine capacity across all states and territories, and associated restrictions on international flight numbers, it is imperative that international travel into Australia is limited to journeys that are for exceptional circumstances only.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on travel exemptions is available on the Department's website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au. These measures are temporary and are reviewed regularly.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 15 February 2021, requesting a response to petition EN2141 relating to the removal of religious observances at the start of parliamentary proceedings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The standing orders set out that prayers will be read at the beginning of sittings, with the exact form of words included in standing order 38. It is for the House itself to decide whether and how to amend standing orders. For the wording of standing order 38 to be changed or be removed, a majority of Members must agree.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The prayer read at the beginning of proceedings remains largely unchanged since it was adopted in 1901, other than when additional words were introduced in 1918 for the remainder of World War I. While standing orders have been reviewed and amended over the years, the House has not chosen to change the practice of commencing with prayers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ultimately, as you know, responsibility for the operations of the House rests with the Members themselves, and any changes to the standing orders can only be approved with the support of a majority of Members.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 enclosing Petition EN2165 concerning extending all current Temporary Graduate (subclass 485) visas (TGV) for an additional year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the contribution TGV holders make in Australia. While the TGV provides eligible graduates with the opportunity to gain practical experience in Australia following their studies, it is important to note that the TGV is a temporary visa and does not guarantee employment or a pathway to permanent residence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are a range of options for international graduates to remain in Australia through the skilled migration program, which is driven by Australia's labour market needs. Further information is available on the Department of Home Affairs' website at: https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/what-we-do/skilled-migration-program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the international community and respective health systems and economies. The primary focus of the Government is on protecting the health of Australians, supporting businesses and jobs, and maintaining the provision of essential goods and services while combatting the pandemic. The wellbeing of Australians who have become unemployed due to COVID-19 is of particular concern to the Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the impact that COVID-19 has had on many temporary visa holders. While the Government is not considering a general extension to the period of stay for TGV holders, it has adopted a flexible approach in relation to visa conditions and made a number of changes to visa arrangements during COVID-19 to support the sector. The student visa measures announced on 20 July 2020, include relaxing the eligibility requirements for a TGV to allow graduates to apply for, and be granted, a TGV outside Australia if they are unable to return to Australia due to COVID-19; and allowing student visa holders to count online study undertaken outside Australia towards the Australian Study Requirement for a TGV. Information about these visa measures is available on the Department's website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, in October 2019, the Government announced changes to Australia's migration program to increase the number of people who choose to live, study and work in regional Australia. The changes to allow an additional period of post-study work for certain TGV holders to support regional Australia took effect on 20 January 2021. Further information can be found on the Department's website at: </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to recent correspondence regarding Petition Number EN2170. The petition draws to the attention of the House, recent actions of China in placing trade penalties on Australian goods that the petitioners allege are a retaliation to actions taken by Australia in our national interest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is facing a number of trade issues in our relationship with China, some dating back over a number of years. We have consistently maintained that we are available to work through issues, and to do that as calmly and effectively as possible in a manner respectful of each other's sovereignty. We will use the mechanisms of the World Trade Organisation to try to resolve matters or challenge decisions where appropriate, but as they are long processes, and we would far rather they be resolved through dialogue.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a long-standing and important relationship with China, which has delivered benefits to both sides. We seek a mature partnership based on respect for Australia's sovereign interests, as we respect China's sovereign interests. We will always be consistent about Australia's national interests and will stand firm on principle.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Bilateral trade and investment have contributed to economic success in both our countries, and Chinese and Australian people are deeply connected at the community level. While we have some differences on important issues, these ought not to disrupt normal contacts, including diplomatic relations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has been clear that we seek to engage constructively with China. We raise our differences directly with China and we deal with challenges on their individual merits, as we always have. In this respect, Embassies and diplomatic staff are essential to maintaining official channels of communications between governments. Difficult times make open channels of communications with counterparts even more important.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 on behalf of the signatories to Petition EN2190 concerning allegations of worker exploitation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's Immigration Program has played a key role in nation building. The Department of Home Affairs' mission is to protect Australia's border and manage the movement of people and goods across it. An important part of managing the Australian border is the Department's implementation of Australia's universal visa system, under which all non-citizens require a valid visa to come to Australia. This system focuses on the contribution a person can make to Australia, rather than their ethnicity, gender or religious beliefs. Australia's temporary visa program, for example, is designed to allow people from other countries to come to Australia for specific purposes that benefit Australia. These include a temporary activity or work, international relations, study or training, or to visit.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In response to the specific issues raised in the Petition; all workers in Australia have the same rights and protections at work, regardless of citizenship or visa status. Employers must comply with Australian workplace and immigration laws, including their obligation to pay the right pay rate for all time worked and to provide a safe workplace. This includes employers engaged in the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government will not tolerate the exploitation of any worker in Australian workplaces - it offends our national values of fairness and it harms not only the employees involved, but also the businesses which do the right thing. It also has the potential to undermine our international reputation as a country of choice for migrant workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All workers have the right to feel safe in the workplace. Employers, businesses and agents can be subject to large fines and possible time in prison if caught exploiting workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is a serious criminal offence for an employer to force an employee to work by threatening or deceiving them, restricting their freedom to leave, or forcing them to pay off an unexplained debt. This behaviour should be reported to the Australian Federal Police by phone on: 131 237 or by completing the online form at: https://www.afp.gov.au/contact-us.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Notwithstanding the Government's position, and existing protections available to migrant workers, in 2016, the Government established the Migrant Workers' Taskforce (the Taskforce) to undertake a review into the ongoing issue of migrant worker exploitation. The Taskforce released its final report in March 2019. It included 22 recommendations, all of which have been agreed, in principle.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since this time, the Department has been working with other key agencies to implement the Taskforce recommendations through a range of initiatives to further combat the issue of migrant worker exploitation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If the signatories to this Petition believe they are being, or have been, exploited or underpaid, they should report to the Fair Work Ombudsman on 13 13 94. The Department will generally not cancel a person's visa for breaching work conditions, as long as they have reported their circumstance appropriately, agree to comply with work conditions in the future and there are no other reasons for cancelling the visa.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's Migration Program is designed to maximise the economic prosperity, national wellbeing and social benefits of immigration by focusing on attracting and selecting highly skilled, young migrants who are less likely to draw from government services such as health, education and aged care.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 enclosing Petition EN2197 concerning Partner visa applicants whose sponsor entered Australia as an illegal maritime arrival (IMA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's migration, refugee and humanitarian programs are designed to achieve a range of economic and social outcomes. Having strong and effective border protection and immigration policies are integral to the successful implementation of these programs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you may be aware, under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958</span>, the Minister has the power to outline the order for considering and prioritising of visa applications. In doing so, the Minister takes account of the resources available, the Australian Government's policy intentions, the need to give priority to certain applications and the size and composition of the Migration Program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government acknowledges the dangerous conditions many people experience around the world and remains committed to helping genuine refugees. Notwithstanding this, it is important to have measures in place to discourage people from risking their lives on a dangerous boat journey.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ministerial Direction No 80 (the Direction), which outlines the order for considering and disposing of family visa applications, forms part of the Government's overall efforts to combat people smuggling and will help sustain public confidence in the fairness of the family migration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Direction provides that the least priority for processing consideration would be applied to family visa applications in which the applicant's sponsor is a person who entered Australia as an IMA and holds a permanent visa. This means a person who enters Australia illegally by boat cannot gain an unfair advantage over those who arrive lawfully.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Nevertheless, the Direction enables a delegate to depart from the order of considering applications if they are satisfied that the application involves special circumstances of a compassionate nature, and there are compelling reasons to depart from that order. The Direction does not apply to former IMA sponsors who have acquired Australian citizenship or holders of protection visas who are not IMAs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, the Government has increased the number of places available to Family visa categories in the program year 2020-21, with 72,300 places allocated to Partner visas. This is an increase of 32,501 places from the 2019-20 planning level of 39,799 places and is expected to contribute to faster Partner visa processing timeframes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN2197 to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 concerning Petition EN2202 in relation to the participation of transgender athletes in women's sport.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges the presentation of Petition EN2202 in the House of Representatives as well as the four signatories to the Petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to ensuring every person involved in sport is treated with respect and dignity and is protected from discrimination, harassment and abuse. It is important that sport is safe, fair and inclusive for all in order to ensure every Australian can enjoy the benefits of participating in sport. We want to see as many people playing sport as possible in Australia, as it promotes good physical and mental health and builds a sense of community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is a proud supporter of women's sport, funding a range of programs and initiatives to bolster the participation of women and girls and augment the increased coverage and investment women's sport has enjoyed in recent years. This includes support to ensure safety is embedded in the culture of Australian sporting organisations for every participant, is reflected in their policies and procedures and understood and practiced at all levels.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the role of National Sporting Organisations (NSO) as the governing bodies of their respective sports in Australia. NSOs are largely responsible for overseeing the network of organisations in their sport which run competitions and implement programs for their participants. This responsibility includes determining the eligibility of participants consistent with relevant federal and state laws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the Government expects that NSOs and professional leagues ensure the integrity of women's sport and sporting competitions is maintained.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At a Federal level, sporting organisations are also expected to comply with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sex Discrimination Act 1984</span> (Act) concerning the eligibility of participants, including transgender athletes. The Act notes circumstances where discrimination on the basis of sex or gender identity is allowed, including where 'any competitive sporting activity in which the strength, stamina or physique of competitors is relevant'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In response to requests from a range of NSOs, a set of guidelines titled The Inclusion of Transgender and Gender Diverse People in Sport 2019 (Guidelines) were developed. The Guidelines were developed by the Australian Human Rights Commission in partnership with Sport Australia and the Coalition of Major Professional and Participation Sports. The Guidelines provide information on the Act and practical guidance on how sporting organisations can promote the inclusion of transgender and gender diverse people without disadvantaging females or compromising on the health and safety of participants. It is not mandatory for sporting organisations to follow or adopt the Guidelines. It is a matter for NSOs to consider and, if necessary, develop and oversee their own inclusion policies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter. </span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 enclosing Petition EN2217 concerning seeking exemptions to international students to enter Australia. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the Minister for Home Affairs as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, to protect Australians from the outbreak of COVID-19, the Australian Government has progressively announced travel restrictions that limit travel to Australia. Until further notice, there is a prohibition on all foreign nationals seeking to travel to Australia, unless they fall within certain exempt categories or have been granted an individual exemption by the Commissioner of the Australian Border Force, Mr Michael Outram APM, or authorised decision-makers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The travel restrictions have been successful in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Australia, and were implemented on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, the Commissioner or authorised decision-makers may grant an individual exemption for the following categories of international students:</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">those completing year 11 and 12, with endorsement from the federal Department of Education, Skills and Employment and support from the relevant Australian state or territory government health authority and education department.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the Commissioner will personally consider travel exemption requests for people who are enrolled in an Australian education institution as a PhD research student, regardless of the visa type held.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">International students are an important part of the Australian community, and we look forward to welcoming them back to our classrooms, campuses and communities, when conditions allow.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN2223 regarding the sending of personal tax statements to MyGov. Your correspondence has been referred to me as I have responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At present, I understand that income statements are not sent to MyGov. Rather, when individuals create a MyGov account, they access their income statement, which has been compiled using information sent to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) by their employer during the year through Single Touch Payroll (STP). If a taxpayer doesn't have a MyGov account, I understand that they are able to call the ATO on 13 26 61 to get a copy of their income statement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Most employers are required to report through STP, which reduces their overall reporting obligations. STP reporting also provides benefits to individuals, such as providing up-to-date visibility of their tax and superannuation information and the pre-filling of income details into their tax return, which reduces the time it takes to lodge each year.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 March 2021, regarding your concerns about the National Disability Insurance Agency's (NDIA) delivery of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS planning process involves the facilitation of a participant-led discussion to gain a picture of the participant's goals, aspirations, current life circumstances and supports. It necessitates a person-centred approach, recognising it is the start of a lifelong relationship between a participant and the NDIA. In assessing the needs of NDIS participants, the NDIA endeavours to work in partnership with the participant.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When identifying the types and amount of reasonable and necessary supports to provide, NDIA planners will review all information provided at the time of planning and make decisions based on the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 </span>(NDIS Act), the rules made under the NDIS Act, and any relevant operational guidelines. The NDIA encourages participants to provide documentation, such as reports from allied health professionals, to assist the NDIA planner determine their required supports according to the NDIS Act.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is on track to deliver the most substantial package of reforms to the NDIS since its establishment, while at the same time, we have continued to make significant improvements to the NDIS.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The reform package will deliver on the final elements of the Productivity Commission's original design for the NDIS, and make it simpler, faster, fairer and more flexible for participants, and their families and carers. It includes the implementation of the Government's response to the 2019 independent <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013</span> (Tune Review) and our commitment to implement the NDIS Participant Service Guarantee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These reforms will help deliver on the promise of the NDIS - to provide Australians with a permanent and significant disability true choice and control over a flexible support package to achieve their goals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has committed $2 million for the Commonwealth Ombudsman to oversee the NDIA' s performance in meeting the standards set out in the Guarantee, which will be made publically available.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With regard to your request for anyone dealing with a NDIS participant or representative being fully trained in the disability being discussed, the NDIA provides training and guidance through a structured and tailored induction program and an ongoing training structure to support its planners in their reasonable and necessary decision making. In addition, the NDIA employs a diverse range of staff from different backgrounds including allied and specialist health professionals and both people with lived experience and living with disabilities.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19: Travel Restrictions</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 15 March 2021 concerning petition EN2280, requesting the Australian Government to lift the international travel ban for those who can provide proof of vaccination and a negative COVID-19 test from seven days prior to departure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges for many people and I note the concerns raised by the petition around the potential impact that this pandemic, and the associated restrictions, can have on the mental health of Australians. The Government shares this concern. I encourage the public to visit my Department's website at: www.health.gov.au using the search term 'looking after your mental health during coronavirus', as we continue to navigate the ongoing effects of the global pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The human biosecurity emergency period under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015</span> is currently in place until 17 June 2021. All changes to the human biosecurity emergency period are made on the advice of Australia's Chief Medical Officer and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. The current medical evidence establishes that COVID-19 is continuing to pose a severe and immediate threat to human health on a significant scale, both internationally and domestically.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst the Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of vaccine preventable diseases, vaccination in Australia is not mandatory. People, parents and carers maintain the right and option to choose whether to receive a vaccination or to vaccinate their children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the primary objective of the vaccine program is to reduce the risk of developing serious disease if a person is infected. Early efficacy data released to date has primarily demonstrated that vaccination prevents development of disease if infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), at least in the short term. More data is required to determine whether these vaccines also prevent vaccinated individuals from transmitting the virus to others and this is a primary consideration in relation to opening borders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Based on the expert medical advice, mandatory quarantine with COVID-19 testing at frequent intervals is currently considered the best strategy for incoming travellers and has been a key pillar of Australia's response to COVID-19. Combined with other measures including high testing rates, social distancing and strong localised response, mandatory hotel quarantine has resulted in comparatively low numbers of cases in Australia compared to the rest of the world.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In order to protect the safety of Australians while they are overseas, the Government also takes into account expert public health advice according to peak international body, the World Health Organization (WHO). At this point in time the WHO does not advise states and territories to introduce proof of vaccination as a requirement for travel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Instead, the recommendation is that combined measures such as those outlined above remain critical while there is global variation in access to a COVID-19 vaccine and while more data are required to understand the impact of vaccination on virus transmission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is considering mechanisms for recognising an international immunisation certificate for COVID-19 and potential alternate entry and quarantine arrangements for returning Australians who may have been vaccinated. These considerations are based on the expert medical advice on vaccination effectiveness and on how best to manage the ongoing risk of transmission from international arrivals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With respect to diagnostic testing, Australia is fortunate to be supported by an expert and extensive network of public and private laboratories with the capability, capacity and appropriate accreditation to detect SARS-CoV-2. However, no single or combination of tests at present are sensitive, timely and reliable enough to detect a person incubating the infection. After initial infection with SARS-CoV-2, it takes a number of days for viral replication to produce enough genetic material to be detected by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. This occurs roughly two to-three days before symptoms become apparent. Testing during the incubation period may return a negative result, even when an individual is infected with SARS-CoV-2.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The major risks with relying on a solution like testing seven days prior to departure is failing to detect an infected passenger who is incubating COVID-19 or of being infected in those seven days. Travel restrictions and mandatory quarantine are considered a reasonable risk mitigation strategy for travellers who are incubating COVID-19, and therefore may not have tested positive to a COVID-19 test before entering and/or departing Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Noting the above, all travellers to Australia, must present evidence of a negative COVID-19 Reverse Transcription Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result, where the test was conducted 72 hours or less prior to the scheduled departure time of their flight (or first flight if the passenger has one or more connecting flights booked for travel to Australia). This provides an additional risk mitigation strategy that is in addition to, not a replacement for, 14-day managed quarantine. To note, people who have been vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine are still required to undertake the PCR test prior to travel. The most up-to-date information for international travellers to Australia, can be found at my Department's website at: www.health.gov.au using the search term 'Coronavirus (COVID-19) FAQs - international travellers to Australia'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I wish to assure you that the Government regularly reviews the international travel restrictions to ensure their appropriateness in terms of global and local epidemiology.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to opening up travel with other low risk countries as soon as the health advice says it is safe to do so. While these measures are regrettable, they are necessary to protect the health of Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 has the ability to cause high levels of morbidity and mortality, with severe or fatal outcomes generally more common among elderly cases or those with comorbid conditions.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regrettably, 909 Australians have died from COVID-19. These deaths were predominately due to outbreaks in aged care facilities and cases among older populations that occurred during July and August 2020.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For all cases since the beginning of the pandemic, 14 per cent have been admitted to hospital, noting that this hospitalisation figure requires cautious interpretation as data is not complete. In addition, a case may be hospitalised for isolation purposes meaning their hospitalisation may not reflect severity of illness. According to sentinel surveillance data, 19 per cent of hospitalised patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. 51 cases (or 91 per cent) of those who died in intensive care units had one or more comorbidities. Australia's case fatality rate has remained stable at 3.1 per cent and, at the time of writing, there have been no reported COVID-19 related deaths in Australia for 2021.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Comorbidities, such as obesity, are serious public health challenges in their own right. That is why, in June 2019, I announced the development of a 10-year National Preventative Health Strategy (Strategy). The Strategy will aim to help Australians improve their health at all stages of life, through early intervention, targeting risk factors, better information and addressing the broader causes for poor health and wellbeing.</span>

This strategy describes the nationally agreed goal of harm minimisation, and outlines agreed national priority areas of focus and policy options. Additionally, in November 2018 the Government launched the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) Strategic Action Plan which aims to reduce the prevalence of FASD and the impact it has on individuals, families, carers and communities.</span>

From 22 March 2021, over 100 GP respiratory clinics and 1,000 general practices joined the COVID-19 vaccination program under Phase 1B of vaccine program roll-out. Among the priority groups in Phase lB are adults with a specified medical condition and adults with a severe disability who have a specified underlying medical condition.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">JobKeeper Payment: Tourism Industry</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 16 March 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Standing Committee on Petitions (EN2320) - a request for a further extension to the JobKeeper Payment and additional support for the travel and tourism sectors. Your correspondence has been referred to me as I have responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The JobKeeper Payment was designed as a national scheme, to apply consistently across a broad range of businesses and industry sectors. As such, the scheme was not intended to apply individual criteria for the payment to any specific sector or group of businesses. On 21 July 2020, in response to the ongoing economic impacts of COVID-19, the Australian Government announced an extension to the JobKeeper Payment for a further six months until 28 March 2021 with the payment rates tapered down to help businesses adjust and gradually transition from the scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The JobKeeper Payment was always intended to be a temporary program designed to support confidence and get businesses back up and running as soon as possible. JobKeeper is just one part of the Government's economic response to support Australians during COVID-19. It was designed to deliver support quickly and at scale and it has achieved its objective of keeping businesses in business and Australians in jobs. JobKeeper has supported nearly half of Australian businesses and one-third of all workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 11 March 2021, in recognition that certain sectors would need some additional assistance, the Government announced a further $1.2 billion in targeted support for the tourism and aviation sectors. The package includes a mix of half-price airline tickets and direct support to keep planes in the air and aviation workers in jobs. Increasing domestic tourism will help businesses along the supply chain including hotels, cafes and restaurants and tour operators get back to normal trading. Through the Tourism Aviation Network Support (TANS) Program, discount ticket prices will be available on more than 45,000 fares per week. Australians will be able to access these discount fares to 14 tourism regions particularly hurt by COVID-19 for travel through to the end of September 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will provide an additional $133 million to extend the Consumer Travel Support Program for three months to support travel agents. This brings the total level of targeted assistance to $261 million, which will help to sustain the travel sector as it supports travellers adjust to COVID-safe travel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also extended existing supports, including the $50 million Business Events Grants Program to provide confidence to the sector and the $94.6 million Zoos and Aquarium program to support zoos, aquariums and wildlife parks to maintain their animal populations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also announced that it will expand and extend its existing SME Guarantee Scheme as part of its commitment to support up to $40 billion in lending to small and medium enterprises. The SME Recovery Loan Scheme will continue to provide assistance to firms that have recently been on JobKeeper and will benefit from an increased government guarantee, allowing lenders to offer a repayment holiday of up to 24 months, longer loan terms, larger loan sizes and the ability for borrowers to refinance existing debt.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The vaccine roll-out is also gathering pace, supporting domestic borders to remain open and providing greater certainty for people to travel for both business and leisure purposes.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 19 March 2021 regarding Petition No. EN2323 regarding the Government's efforts to assist Australians return during the pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Supporting the return of vulnerable Australians from overseas remains one of the Government' s highest priorities. We are working with airlines, Commonwealth agencies and States and Territories to assist Australians to return and to access available commercial flights. Since March 2020, over 490,000 Australians have returned to Australia. During this period, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has supported over 42,700 Australians return, including over 17,000 people on 120 government facilitated flights. As at 31 March 2021, almost 120,000 Australians have returned since National Cabinet met on 18 September 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to take a multi-pronged approach to facilitate the return of Australians. This includes helping Australians to access scheduled commercial flights under the existing flight caps, arranging government facilitated commercial flights above the caps, providing financial assistance to vulnerable Australians through the Overseas Financial Assistance program as well as providing information and consular assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Based on expert medical advice, mandatory quarantine is the best strategy to help people return while protecting the health of all Australians. On 5 March 2020, the Commonwealth and Northern Territory Governments reached agreement to increase the capacity of the Centre for National Resilience at Howard Springs after the end of the cyclone season in the Northern Territory. This will increase the capacity of Howard Springs from 850 persons per fortnight to 2,000 persons per fortnight with a ramp up from late April 2021, subject to capital works, and full capacity between June and December 2021. The Centre for National Resilience is the Commonwealth Government's response to the National Cabinet commissioned National Review of Hotel Quarantine conducted by Ms Jane Halton, AO PSM. This approach does not include using detention centres as quarantine facilities, reflecting the significant and complex medical and logistical resources required to safely quarantine vulnerable Australians arriving from abroad.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Government will continue to support repatriation flights for Australians through to the end of 2021, as required. Further flights are planned from the United Kingdom, South Africa and India in the coming weeks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Throughout COVID-19, Australia has successfully balanced the safety of our community at home whilst ensuring significant numbers of Australians overseas can return.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 March 2021 originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning a petition (EN2368) received to establish a reinsurance pool for northern Australia to address availability issues in public liability insurance. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the petitioner's concerns regarding access to public liability insurance. However, the policy offerings an insurer provides is a commercial decision for insurers to make, based on a number of factors that influence an insurer's appetite for, and capacity to take on, a client's risk. Similarly , the setting of insurance premiums are influenced by these factors. To discuss the factors used to determine policy offerings and premiums, the petitioner may wish to contact the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) on 1300 728 228.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The public liability insurance market in Australia is affected by each level of government. At the state level, legislation covering civil liability generally requires that businesses address injuries arising from negligence in a timely and fair manner. Public liability insurance puts businesses in the position to fulfil that mandated requirement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State law may also require professionals or certain types of business to hold insurance as a condition of licensing. In the case where a business requires a state-issued license to operate as is the case for some tourism operators, then it is also expected that the business has a current public liability insurance policy in place to the satisfaction of the relevant state body. Local councils may also stipulate that a business must bold public liability insurance before contracting or providing a permit.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I would suggest the petitioner raise this issue with their state government and explore, potentially through an insurance broker, whether there are any further actions the petitioner could take to lower the risk profile of their business to reduce the costs of cover.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More generally, regarding the costs and availability of insurance in northern Australia, in 20I7, the Australian Government directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into the supply of residential building (home), contents and strata insurance in northern Australia. On 28 December 2020, the ACCC released its final report, details of which can be found online, at: www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-ongoing/northem-australia-insurance-inquiry. The Government is currently considering the recommendations in the ACCC 's final report.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of its response to the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements, the Government is establishing a national resilience, relief and recovery agency to coordinate and align Australia's national capability to build resilience, better prepare for natural disasters, and recover from all hazards. The Government will also establish Resilience Services, a climate and disaster risk information service to support our national preparedness, response, relief, recovery and resilience efforts. These measures will contribute to addressing the underlying drivers of insurance affordability issues in the region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The issue of insurance availability and affordability is a matter that requires action from the Commonwealth as well as state governments and industry. The ACCC' s final report recommended that states abolish stamp duty on home, contents and strata insurance products. This recommendation requires the action of state and territory governments. If the petitioner would like more information about the Queensland Government's position on this recommendation, the petitioner should contact their state Member of Parliament.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 March 2021 originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petitions (EN2395) - a further extension to the JobKeeper Payment for the arts and entertainment sectors. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The JobKeeper Payment was designed as a national scheme, to apply consistently across a broad range of Australian businesses and industry sectors. As such, the scheme was not intended to apply individual criteria for the payment to any specific sector or group of businesses. On 21 July 2020, in response to the ongoing economic impacts of COVID-19, the Australian Government announced an extension to the JobKeeper Payment for a further six months until 28 March 2021 with the payment rates tapered down to help businesses adjust and gradually transition from the scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The JobKeeper Payment was always intended to be a temporary program designed to support confidence and get businesses back up and running as soon as possible. It was designed to deliver support quickly and at scale and it has achieved its objective of keeping businesses in business and Australians in jobs. JobKeeper has supported nearly half of Australian businesses and one-third of all workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">JobKeeper is just one part of the Government's economic response to support Australians during COVID-19. In 2020, in recognition of the economic, social and national importance of the cultural and creative sector, the Government announced almost $800 million in extra arts and entertainment funding. This is on top of a record annual investment of around $750 million in core funding, and on top of the substantial support provided to the sector through whole of economy measures.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has continued to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 to ensure that policy responses are timely, appropriate and proportionate to address the challenges posed by the pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 25 March 2021, the Government announced a $125 million extension of the Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand (RISE) Fund, available until 31 December 2021. This is in addition to the $75 million the Government has allocated to the Fund to date. For further information on the RISE funding visit: www.arts.gov.au/funding-and-support/rise-fund.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also announced a further $10 million to Support Act to allow them to respond quickly and effectively to the continuing needs of artists, crew and music workers including sound and lighting technicians, managers, booking agents, promoters, venue workers and roadies still affected by COVID-19. This is in addition to the $10 million provided to Support Act announced in April last year. For further information on this support visit: supportact.org.au/get-help/.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr WALLACE:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—The scourge of family, domestic and sexual violence is sadly all too familiar. Since this inquiry commenced in June of last year, more than 40 women will have been murdered at the hands of a current or former partner. Countless other women, children and men will have experienced non-lethal family violence and abuse. Sometimes we see the names and faces of the victims on our screens, but more often than not family violence remains hidden. What we do know is that the impact of this shocking violence and abuse is profound and long-lasting on victim-survivors, on their families and friends and on the very fabric of our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising the need to stem this violence, governments across Australia came together in 2009 to establish the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children. Many achievements have flowed from the national plan, including the creation of Our Watch, the Stop it at the Start awareness campaign and national support services such as 1800 RESPECT. Importantly, through the national plan the community has begun to grapple with the cultural change that is necessary to prevent violence from occurring in the first place. More people are now willing to speak up and to challenge the attitudes and behaviours that lead to violence. However, there is much more work to be done. Despite significant investments from governments of all jurisdictions and all political persuasions, it is clear that the national plan has not achieved its objective of a significant and sustained reduction in violence against women and their children. As a nation, we can do better and we must do better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry was an opportunity to reflect on the successes and shortcomings of the national plan, to hear from experts in the field about what has and what has not worked and to identify opportunities to ensure that the next national plan leads to a meaningful reduction in family, domestic and sexual violence. It should go without saying that the committee took this task very seriously. The committee carefully considered around 300 submissions and held 90 hours of public hearings over the course of 16 days. The committee also held to in camera hearings where it heard from individuals about their lived experience of family, domestic and sexual violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this report, the committee has made 88 bipartisan recommendations which seek to inform the development of the next national plan. These recommendations are wide ranging but can be grouped under five main themes. First, the next national plan should involve a more uniform approach across Australia but one that recognises the many different forms of family violence and the diversity of victim-survivors and perpetrators. This should include the development of a uniform national definition of family, domestic and sexual violence that takes account of non-physical forms of violence, such as coercive control, financial abuse and technology facilitated abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the next national plan must seek to engender a culture of accountability while also providing more support to the specialist family violence workforce. All Australian governments should be held to account through hard targets. Similarly, while the committee has called for more secure funding for frontline services, ongoing monitoring and evaluation is critical to better understand what works, what does not and why. To support these recommendations, the committee has proposed to establish a national commissioner who would have independent oversight of the next national plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, education is critical. There remains a need for greater awareness and understanding of the many forms of family, domestic and sexual violence and the causes, the impacts of this violence and the ways in which it can be prevented. The committee has recommended a continued focus on primary prevention; the rollout of universal, age-appropriate respectful relationships and sexual consent education; and measures to help workers in the social services sector identify and respond to violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth, in the response to family, domestic, and sexual violence, the welfare of victim-survivors and their children should be paramount. The next national plan should seek to improve victim-survivors' access to specialist services as well as housing, legal aid and financial assistance. The committee has recommended improvements to risk identification, including ensuring that coercive control is recognised as not only a form of abuse in its own right but also a precursor to severe physical abuse and, in fact, homicide. The committee has also made recommendations for improving services to victim-survivors in times of natural disasters, informed by our experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the next national plan must continue to hold perpetrators to account for their use of violence. This should include increased penalties for breaches of domestic violence orders and improved information sharing about perpetrators. The committee has also recommended more research to better understand why perpetrators choose to use violence and an increased focus on evidence-based programs to change perpetrator behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I would like to thank members of the committee. I would like to thank many organisations and individuals who have contributed evidence to the inquiry. In particular, thank you to the victim-survivors who shared their experiences with the committee. We acknowledge your courage in speaking out and advocating for change. The hard work and dedication of the members of the committee, many of whom are in the chamber this morning, was, quite frankly, very commendable. This was, in some cases, quite harrowing work, and the work that the members did really speaks volumes. It was an 88-recommendation bipartisan report. I'm very, very proud to stand here and say that this is parliament at its best, when we really do recognise that the line which runs up the centre of this floor doesn't exist when it comes to the welfare and security of victims-survivors of domestic violence. The committee hopes that this report will contribute to our collective national effort to end family, domestic and sexual violence. It is perpetrators who are responsible for their use of violence, but everyone has a role in speaking up to make change and to stop violence before it starts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has already acted in the budget on a number of these 88 recommendations. I'm very pleased to see that, on a number of those 88 recommendations, the government is taking a very leaning forward approach. It announced some of those things just last night, so we are on the road towards zero. The committee implores all Australian governments to consider this report carefully and to act on its recommendations with urgency. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:56</span>):  by leave—As the deputy chair of the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee I am very pleased to rise in the House today and speak on this report, following our rather extensive inquiry over the last eight to nine months of this parliament into family, domestic and sexual violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I want to thank the chair for his leadership in helping ensure that this committee stayed on track at a time when we were in the midst of COVID. Like all committee work had to, we were able to shift to digital platforms in order to take vital evidence on an issue that has now really become such an urgent one. It has been for a long time, but family, domestic and sexual violence in Australia is now well and truly in the government spotlight. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted to be able to table this report. It is a weighty tome, and there are 88 solid bipartisan recommendations in it. I won't go through each of those; I think the chair has done an excellent job in mapping out some of those broad themes. On behalf of all the Labor members of the committee I sincerely thank the chair and our government colleagues, who made great contributions in ensuring that this report was the best it could be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to give a shout-out to the extraordinary efforts of the secretariat. People may not realise that we were actually running two major concurrent reports. We were also doing a report into housing and homelessness—another national crisis in Australia—at the same time as our work on family, domestic and sexual violence. The secretariat were terribly underresourced and overstretched at the time, and we were able to get one additional staff person to help crack through two really big inquiries. We are yet to table the housing and homeless inquiry; that's yet to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the secretariat, I want to acknowledge the contributions from victims-survivors who gave especially powerful testimony to the committee. We are forever indebted to them for sharing their experiences of family, domestic and sexual violence. I also thank those frontline services and organisations that made contributions on the most pressing issue facing us as a country, at a time when they were probably the most stretched and pushed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the chair said, we had more than 350 submissions, 47 confidential submissions, 16 days of inquiries and 90 hours of evidence over many months. In addition to what the chair mapped out, I would just like to say that these are very strong bipartisan commitments—recommendations. I slipped because I want to see them become government commitments. I will acknowledge that there were measures in the budget last night. But, before I give too many pats on the back, I want to say that this is off the back of women and children in Australia making their voices heard, loud and clear, year after year after year until, finally, enough was enough. The evidence taken by our committee was absolutely unequivocal. The scale of this problem is greater than either the resources or the resolve that the government has committed to date. We would want to see these recommendations endorsed, wholly, by the government, because that is what's needed to face up to the challenge and to finally embrace the capacity and the obligation that we have, as a Commonwealth, to actually do so much more. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As good as this report is, I could point to another eight reports that have been tabled in this parliament over eight years asking for urgent action on this issue. I'm not going to do too much self-congratulation just at this point. When I see the full weight of government behind these 88 recommendations then I'll feel like the job might well have been done. Many of the recommendations made by this committee, as I said, have been made by previous committees. They could have been implemented by the government many years ago. That failure has had some very real consequences. The economic cost of violence against women and children in Australia is estimated to be $26 billion a year. Victims and survivors bear more than half of that cost, as well as the long-term social, health and psychological damage. It's a very heavy burden. Our failure to act on family, domestic and sexual violence, over many years now, has resulted in a very heavy burden for women and children in this nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must not ignore this report. The recommendations should be implemented immediately. The government doesn't have to wait till the next national plan to implement the majority of these recommendations. The Labor members on the committee are calling for urgent action to be taken. A crucial test of this government will be, indeed, how quickly it responds to this report and how willing it is to enact the recommendations. It cannot sit on the shelves gathering dust like the other eight reports over the last eight years have done. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr WALLACE:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—Australia is historically and indelibly linked to its neighbours in the Pacific islands. Our shared history of endurance and mutual assistance during times of major international conflict, natural disaster, climate change and pandemic has forged links with our Pacific island family which go beyond statehood and diplomacy. Our people-to-people links forged over centuries are at the core of this deep understanding, and defence relationships play a significant role in creating and maintaining this unique connection. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence and security challenges faced in the Pacific are now more prevalent and complex than ever before. It behoves all members of our Pacific family to be aware of emerging issues and to face them together in an organised, collaborative and coordinated manner. As a regional medium power, Australia bears significant responsibility for creating the environment and providing the means to achieve just this. From fisheries management, protection and surveillance to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, intelligence collection and sharing, climate change and the global pandemic, Australia's Defence Organisation stands ready to play its part in the Pacific step-up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, however, more to be done. As the committee heard throughout the conduct of the inquiry, there are several existing and proven defence initiatives and programs which contribute significantly to the Pacific step-up. These include the longstanding Defence Cooperation Program and the Pacific Maritime Security Program. The committee also heard that there are ways to improve these initiatives as well as new and innovative ways to forge, deepen and strengthen ties between members of the Pacific family. This is where the future of Australian defence relationships should be focused. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the conduct of this inquiry was impacted by COVID-19, the submissions received and evidence heard at public hearings were of the highest quality, and the committee thanks all of those who contributed to it. In particular, the committee thanks those members of the diplomatic corps whom we held a roundtable with, and the committee is very keen to ensure that that is an ongoing arrangement that we make with members of the Pacific diplomatic corps. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report and its recommendations reflect the committee's belief that Australia's defence relationships in the Pacific are extremely important, are becoming increasingly so and that additional efforts can and should be made to ensure the security of our region in the years to come. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank all members of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for their efforts in this inquiry. I would like to thank all those who made submissions, particularly those members of the diplomatic corps who took part in that roundtable and, of course, I would like to thank members of the secretariat that worked hard in putting this report together and also previous members as well. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—After 20 years of practising as a psychologist I have never seen greater need for mental health services in Australia. Mental health challenges for Australians have become the norm. The system is strained. The pandemic, the bushfires, the floods and then the COVID recession have increased the pressure on the sector, which was already in need of reform. The emergence of COVID-19 reminded us of the importance of mental health and suicide prevention as a national priority. It's been described as the shadow pandemic, but no matter the name we cannot ignore the crisis which lies before us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 10 December 2020 the House of Representatives resolved to establish a Select Committee on Mental Health and Suicide Prevention. The terms of reference highlighted significant reports recently completed and work underway. The committee was tasked with inquiring into the current mental health system and its capacity to respond to events such as the pandemic and bushfires, as well as a range of matters beyond the scope of earlier reviews and reports. There have been significant efforts made by government and non-government bodies to respond to the increased demand for mental health and suicide prevention services over the last 12 months and more. There have also been increasing calls by industry, consumers and carers for national reform to the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee I would like to thank the Productivity Commission, the Department of Health and the National Mental Health Commission for their evidence at the opening public hearing. This provided insight into government-led initiatives and reporting gaps, informing the work of the committee moving forward. Through this initial phase of the inquiry, the committee has noted several themes: workforce, including workforce capacity concerns; the role of professional bodies and the need for multidisciplinary teams; the coordination of funding of services and outcome measurement; accessibility and affordability concerns, especially for at-risk groups; early intervention, including stepped care, telehealth and digital health services; and stigma as a barrier to accessing services. We also thank the individuals and organisations who have contributed submissions to this inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee will now move into phase 2 of this inquiry. Let me assure stakeholders that the committee has heard their concerns and acknowledged the sector's desire for government to implement change. Reports, reviews and strategies are essential tools, but we must bring the community with us to drive change and improve people's lives. The committee, having considered these government reports and strategic reviews, will now look to identify those areas that need further attention. We will engage with stakeholders across the country through a series of public hearings to listen to views from those who are on the front line providing services, innovating to meet challenges, lobbying for change and training the workforce not only of today but of tomorrow. I would like to thank the secretariat, for the long hours and hard work they have put into the committee to date, and also members of the committee themselves. The final report is due in November this year. On behalf the committee, I commend the interim report to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  by leave—I want to thank the member for Reid, the chair of the committee, for her work, and other committee members and the secretariat for producing this interim report on mental health and suicide prevention in a very short time frame. This has been a challenging committee because of the time frame, but we have had the benefit of many reports written prior to our meeting: the Productivity Commission inquiry, the National Suicide Prevention Adviser's report, the Victorian royal commission report and the National Mental Health Workforce Strategy. They have informed the place we have reached in the interim report. We have had the opportunity to take into account the 2019 bushfires, which hit my local community so badly, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all recognise that the need for improved mental health services was evident well before we went through bushfires in my community, followed by flood, then COVID and then another massive flood in March, which is going to have long-term mental health impacts. We knew there was a need, and there are important issues raised in this report—one of which is around affordability, which the committee considers to be a significant and ongoing barrier to accessing mental health services in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give an example from my own community. I have young people who limit their psychology or psychiatry appointments because they have to pay up to a $200 gap fee each time, or they miss out altogether and don't even start their treatment. I have parents who don't have private health insurance and can't afford the private residential programs for their kids who are suffering eating disorders. They really consider themselves at the mercy of an under-resourced public health system. These are some of the issues that we as a committee have taken evidence on. Just last week I spoke to a mum whose daughter has an eating disorder. The very best advice they can get from any doctor anywhere in Sydney is to go to England for treatment. That's the state of services available to people not just in Western Sydney, but in Sydney. We know, as a committee, that we need to improve these things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that, as a committee, we will do our best to provide good advice. But, as good as our reports may be, we need not just this report or more reports, but for those reports to be actioned. What's needed is services on the ground, and certainly in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury we need specialist services that are accessible to people—young people, old people, anxious people, psychotic people, people with complex mental health needs and people needing early intervention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is needed is more capacity for the Blue Mountains satellite headspace, for example, which, since it opened, has had 80 per cent of its clients reporting suicide ideation. I've been very grateful to my local services for providing submissions to this committee for the second stage of our reporting. I think my engagement in the committee shows that I am extremely motivated to be involved in any useful decision-making process about where investment in mental health services should go, and I obviously welcome any investment in additional services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do stand here today asking a question that people of the Hawkesbury are asking, which is: why are we still waiting for a headspace in the Hawkesbury? The last budget had funding for extra headspaces, and we didn't get one. Young people have been waiting and waiting; their parents have been waiting and waiting; their teachers have been waiting and waiting. I think that urgency, the need for it, comes through in our report. We really do feel that these reports need to be actioned. What we really need in the Hawkesbury is a key coordinating place with a no-wrong-door policy for young people to walk in and say to someone who will understand, 'I need help'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In lieu of those things happening, as a committee we have been encouraging our grassroots community organisations to make submissions to this inquiry. I've had the opportunity to work with a group of young people right at the grassroots. They have been doing amazing work to develop their own way of reaching out to their peers to get them to talk about their battles with mental health, partly addressing the issue we raise in this report around stigma—one of the key themes that comes through in this report—and I look forward to helping them launch their initiative in the coming weeks. It will partly tackle the stigma associated with mental ill health and partly direct people to digital and phone support services, both of which are themes of this report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every one of the reports our committee has considered stresses early intervention, as the chair has said. Tackling issues when they first appear is a more effective method than ignoring them, leaving them untreated so that they compound. The committee has had the benefit of being able to hear from very wise people who've spent a lot of time working through these issues. I'm pretty sure every committee member values that expertise. Certainly the Labor members on the committee value that expertise. I'm not sure if any of the work that this committee has discussed or that the witnesses appearing before it have discussed has been addressed at all by funding the government has allocated in this year's budget, but I look forward to learning more about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to touch on one last point in our interim report, and that's telehealth services. This report recognises just how useful an expansion of telehealth services, and the take-up by consumers, has been during COVID. There is no doubt it has saved lives. But if you live somewhere like the Macdonald Valley—which has faced flood and fire; where the landlines go down, sometimes for weeks; where there's no mobile coverage, and the latency of the satellite via the NBN means it's not filling that gap—you can't actually access those services. So, when we think about mental health as a committee, we can't see it in isolation. We need to make sure the services that are available are accessible to everyone, one way or another, wherever they live. I look forward to our committee finding a way to really add value to the work that the committed experts in the field are doing, and have been doing for many years. I thank them all for being involved with our committee, as they have been with so many other inquiries in the past. I look forward to doing further work with a very dedicated team to get some action here.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SIMMONDS:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—Thank you very much to the stakeholders who participated in the inquiry and, of course, to the committee members and the secretariat for their very diligent efforts. Illicit drugs should be an issue of grave concern for all of us in this chamber and for all Australians. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission reported that Australia's stimulant consumption is the fourth-highest in the world. We're third-highest for the consumption of meth and MDMA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this inquiry the committee has heard that the economic impact of illicit drug use is over $27 billion every year. That figure does not include the estimated $12 billion cost of harm to partners and children of those using methamphetamines. Drug use doesn't just affect and harm the users. It is a scourge on families and particularly on the most vulnerable in our society: our kids. The report of the committee recounts how approximately 50 to 80 per cent of all child abuse and neglect cases substantiated by child protection services in this nation involve some degree of substance abuse by the parents. For those who advocate pill testing, injection rooms and other policies to legalise recreational drug use, understand that you are not just enabling the users; you are destroying the opportunities and futures of innocent children who deserve better than the cycle of addiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While safe injecting rooms or pill testing may reduce health harms to the drug user, the committee also heard how this narrow approach exacerbates the broader harms to our society. Young Australians are dying from illicit drug use, not just through overdoses or dirty needles but also through risk-taking behaviours related to their drug use, such as drug driving. So many young lives have their trajectory to success harmed by drug use, cutting off their educational and employment opportunities, which limits them for the rest of their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee report therefore advocates for an increased focus on the prevention approach to illicit drug use—where people are assisted through education to avoid illicit drugs from the beginning, instead of trying to cure them after the fact through addiction treatment. To target illicit drug use, our national law enforcement agencies have done a tremendous job ramping up their efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission also reported, as part of this inquiry, that, over the past decade, while the Australian population increased by around 13 per cent, the number of national illicit drug seizures increased by 77 per cent and the weight of illicit drugs seized nationally increased by 241 per cent. That not only shows the effort that our law enforcement agencies are going through and the success they are having; it also shows the growing scale of the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the committee's report demonstrates that enforcement is only one side of the coin. It must be coupled with public communication campaigns that represent an important part in lifting education levels on risk, supporting other policing elements and enabling better decision-making among the public. The committee and I are very concerned that there has been no National Drugs Campaign activity since early 2018. This is particularly relevant, with reports of increased problematic drug use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clearly, the time is ripe for action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommends that the government implement a new public communications campaign, via the National Drugs Campaign, that will support law enforcement agencies' efforts to reduce current and future illicit drug demand. Ideally, the campaign should consider the national and international best practice contained in this report, but also include a combination of shock and fear tactics that target the behavioural drug use rather than the individuals themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also recommends that the government present, as part of the new communications campaign, targeted messages to different cohorts, including a national schools element, as well as taking a long-term approach, of at least three to five years, to the campaign, to ensure that the messages from the campaign take root in our community over time. With a committed and collaborative approach to reducing drug demand, we can reduce the harms caused by illicit drugs to individuals and across the broader Australian society. I commend the committee's report to the House.</span>

I indicate that the opposition will be supporting the bill, but I foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment at the end of my remarks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a very modest one in its impact, to say the very least, but it is important. It highlights the difficulty that the health system in Australia is having with coming to grips with modern information management systems and digital technology, with what many other if not almost all other sectors of our economy and society have done in relation to grasping the opportunities of modern information technology. I well remember when former Prime Minister Tony Abbott was the health minister, close to two decades ago, and said that his No. 1 KPI as health minister was to introduce an e-health record. Yet still we struggle with having good digital systems that ensure that people are able to have confidence that their health records are stored digitally and are available, subject to their consent, obviously, by all of their clinicians—but I digress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill deals with a particular challenge that is fairly extraordinary. I make no criticism of the government for the fact that we've found this challenge. It just reflects the slow transition of the health system to modern information systems. The challenge is that, under current legislation, once a medical practitioner gains fellowship with their specialist college—when a medical practitioner is admitted to the College of Surgeons or the College of Psychiatrists, for example—they are then able to charge higher Medicare rebates. The way they do that is by making an application to Services Australia, which in the ordinary course of events is approved. They are then able to charge the higher Medicare rebates. The current system as legislated requires that medical practitioner to pay a prescribed fee of $30 and to pay that fee by way of cheque or money order. I'm not sure whether they're required to fax through a copy of the money order or send it by telegram or carrier pigeon, but the system requires them to pay by cheque or money order. It is highly prescriptive. One could argue reasonably that this system was slightly outdated even before the COVID pandemic, but it became a particular challenge, obviously, during the pandemic. It became very difficult because of movement restrictions and suchlike that really made it very difficult for medical practitioners to move up through their specialist registration with their college and then be able to charge a higher Medicare rebate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're told that the government explored the option of implementing more-modern payment systems for these fees—one could ask why they weren't already in place—but the advice from government is that the cost of an upgrade to something slightly more modern than the payment of a fee by money order or cheque was assessed as being far greater than the loss in revenue from scrapping the fee. If there are younger people watching these proceedings, I wonder whether we'll have to explain to them what a cheque is. I've talked to members on our side—I'm sure it's the same on the other side—about when you bring a new staff member into your electorate office and pay a sponsorship to a local sporting club or suchlike by cheque. A number of us have stories where much younger members of staff have literally looked at this oddly sized piece of paper and asked, 'What is this?' Anyway, apparently the cost of moving to a more modern payment system was going to cost more than simply scrapping the $30 fee, so the government has taken the decision to remove the fee entirely, which is the decision this bill gives effect to. That seems a sensible approach to this rather peculiar information management challenge that the government has identified, and we will support it. What we want to see, obviously, is medical practitioners who have done all of that hard work to gain admission to their specialist college able to continue to practise as a specialist as soon as possible and, obviously, charge the higher Medicare rebates that go with that specialisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the beginning of my remarks, this particular challenge really does reinforce the ongoing challenge that our health system has in moving towards more modern information management systems. I know there are a couple of members in the House on both sides of this chamber—the member for Macarthur and the member for Higgins—who will be speaking on this bill who have much more direct experience of this than me. But I hark back to that KPI that former health minister Tony Abbott identified in 2004, almost two decades ago. His first KPI, his most important KPI, as he said then, was to transition the health system to one based around a functional, personally controlled electronic health record. We still grapple with these things today, as this bill has reminded us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a couple of examples of some of the ongoing challenges in the health system—firstly, in relation to the use of new and sometimes not-so-new information technology, and that is in relation to telehealth; and, secondly, in relation to the broader workforce challenges that this bill, indirectly, is dealing with as well, in terms of medical practitioners moving to specialist colleges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of telehealth is one that the medical health system has been grappling with for some time. The use of telehealth has been in place for some time for a range of different assessments and therapies. But, as the pandemic really hit last year, the member for McMahon, when he was the shadow health minister, spent a lot of energy and time calling on the government to mainstream telehealth at a time when Australians were, to varying degrees around the country, locked down in their homes but still needed to be able to consult their treating doctors. To the government's credit, they heard those calls not just from the member for McMahon but from the health system and the community more broadly and introduced telehealth as a broad based MBS measure, albeit on a temporary basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister said in November, I think, that it was his intention to make telehealth a permanent measure, but all we've had since then is a rolling series of six-month by six-month extensions by the minister, which are good as far as they go but don't give that ongoing, permanent confidence to the community and, importantly, to the health workforce that this is a permanent transition in the way in which health services are delivered. A couple of weeks ago—I can't remember the exact date—the minister did make a decision to extend the telehealth measures that were due to expire on 30 June to the end of the 2021 calendar year. Again, it's better than nothing but a far cry from the permanency that the minister promised back in November.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Broadly, at first blush, although people want permanency and some sense of confidence about how this is going to operate, this was something welcomed to a degree by the community and by the health sector—until they read the finer detail. The finer detail was to abolish all but two of the MBS items allowing phone consults. That is a very serious set of decisions that very understandably have caused a great deal of concern in the broader community as they have become aware of it but particularly in the health sector. These phone items—particularly, for example, the long consult item—have been widely used through the pandemic since they were introduced. We were told that there have been 2.8 million items for level C phone consults and nearly 200,000 items for level D consults since the measures were introduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There had been some talk around Canberra that the department and the minister were concerned that maybe these phone consultations were being misused or weren't the clinically optimal way for GPs, particularly, to consult with their patients. But it was very vague; it was very vague what the actual concern was. I think that we, as members of parliament, all understand that there's quite a variety of levels of comfort with different technology. The government says, 'We want people consulting with their GP, if they're not face-to-face, over video consult.' That's fine, except where, first of all, patients aren't comfortable or don't have the technology quite yet to do video consultations, or, for that matter—and I'll come to this—where the doctor says: 'Actually, we're quite comfortable with doing a phone consult. We don't need to see a person for the particular purpose of the consult in question here.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's really why there has been such a strong reaction from doctors groups to this decision, which was subject to no consultation with them. It was a complete surprise after they read the fine print of the announcement by the minister that he was extending—again, on a temporary basis—the telehealth items that were introduced during the pandemic. The AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said that the profession had been blindsided by the government's decision. He said: 'The permanent future of telehealth must include access for people who are disadvantaged, and that means, at this stage, telephone consults. The beneficiaries of telehealth are patients, not doctors.' He further went on to say, 'We believe that the quality of care provided over telephone consultation is excellent, so long as it's being done appropriately, and is no different to what is provided over video.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, if they're doing a telehealth consult, there are circumstances where the doctor will want to see the patient; they will want to have a video consult to see the particular rash or have some other visual assessment of their patient. We should trust GPs to make that assessment; we should trust the clinical judgement of GPs to make a decision about whether, in a particular circumstance, a phone consult is acceptable and appropriate—particularly given that they, better than anyone, understand the circumstance of their patients. They, better than anyone, understand that there are some patients who are not, at least yet, comfortable and able to access video technology. Maybe the government would have understood that better if they had actually consulted with doctor groups about this decision—I do make that point. As I said, this particular bill does highlight again the challenges that the health system is having in coming to grips with modern technology. Frankly, this government is even having difficulty in coming to grips with the appropriate use of rather longstanding technology, like telephones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I close my contribution I will also make some remarks generally around workforce. The measures in this budget dealing with more general health, rather than aged care and mental health, are relatively modest. To the extent that there are measures, they're broadly measures that the opposition would support. But I want to talk about one particular measure that was—as almost every measure in the budget was—leaked to the media some days ago: the decision to boost bulk-bill rebates for rural and regional Australia. The opposition supports measures to increase bulk-billing and is very aware of the particular challenges, first of all in attracting sufficient numbers of health professionals, including GPs, to rural and regional Australia; that was something which we worked very hard on when we were last in government. I had the honour of working as the parliamentary secretary to the then Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, at the time, and this is something that we broadly support. But I want to draw attention to these ongoing challenges that are presented by the application of the Modified Monash Model. Again, this is something that leaves a number of communities in Australia out in the cold with this latest decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the decision to increase bulk-billing rebates for rural and regional Australia was announced, it was presented as something that would support communities and clinics outside the big cities. As I was going through the papers, it appeared to apply to Modified Monash Model areas 3 to 7, so it leaves out areas 1 and 2. Just last week, as I was travelling through the Hunter Valley with the member for Shortland and the member for Newcastle, and then when I spent time on the Central Coast with the member for Dobell, I met GP after GP who drew attention to the challenge those communities are having attracting and retaining GPs and keeping up bulk-billing rates because of the cuts to their incomes, on top of the Medicare rebate freeze that they dealt with, through the application of the Modified Monash Model system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The roundtables that we had with the member for Dobell on the Central Coast really highlighted a region whose population, compared to the demographic average across the country, is older than average and has a range of more complex health conditions. It gets no support from this decision. Again, it is treated as if it's part of Sydney. There are parts of Sydney that are treated as what we used to call a district of workforce shortage, but the Central Coast is not one of them. If you actually go through the Central Coast and talk to GPs who have surgeries that have no GPs in them—surgeries that were built to deal with the enormous growth in population on the Central Coast, a growth in population that is weighted towards the older part of the population—the lack of any attention in this budget to these challenges around bulk billing and the availability of workforce in regions like the Central Coast and the Hunter Valley is particularly stark.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  The Morrison government always has a view to the future. Whenever there is an opportunity, no matter how small, to make an efficiency gain and improve the lives of hardworking everyday Australians, we take it. This legislation exemplifies this in a very small way. It removes a minor but impractical administrative measure that burdens medical practitioners and ultimately their patients. This is in line with the Morrison government's commitment to delivering an even better post-COVID-19 healthcare system. We should be ambitious for our healthcare system. That is why I served on the board of Cabrini hospital before coming to this place. The only hospital in Higgins, it is a not-for-profit Catholic-based private hospital. As I said in my first speech, our healthcare system is undoubtedly one of the best, if not the best, in the world. It is a unique and effective blend of public and private, where the private sector provides innovation and choice and the public sector provides a safety net for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill simplifies the administrative processes for recognition of specialist and consultant physicians for Medicare purposes under the Health Insurance Act 1973. I note the member for Macarthur in the chamber here today. I know he will welcome this small addition to the changes we're rolling out. It will remove the requirement to pay a $30 prescribed fee for specialist and consultant physicians for Medicare purposes. This benefits practitioners and also Services Australia, who are tasked with processing this fee. Ultimately, it helps patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently the pathway to be recognised as a specialist or consultant physician requires a medical practitioner to apply to Services Australia for access to higher Medicare rebates. This process requires a medical practitioner to pay a prescribed fee of $30 by a cheque or money order to have their application processed. The issue with this payment is that it is fundamentally outdated, an issue heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Movement restrictions and in-person services quotas meant that practitioners had trouble paying the fee, while Services Australia had trouble processing the fee. As a result, patients missed out on receiving higher Medicare rebates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of requiring a new modern system to take digital payments—and it is pretty hard to believe that we are talking about this in the 21st century—is far in excess of the $200,000 in revenue this payment generates over four years. Put simply, this is a prime example of red tape. It does not contribute significantly to government revenue, it doesn't help doctors and, with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is now unfairly hurting the hip pocket of patients. This bill corrects this issue. This small but important tweak is just one of the Morrison government's efforts to ensure a modern and efficient healthcare system post COVID-19.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of COVID-19 means that we have been required to become more sophisticated and flexible in the use of technology and to think differently about how to solve problems that everyday Australians face. For the short term, we will have to continue to be agile and creative—and I welcome the fact that Australia has been very good at pivoting across many different aspects, including our healthcare sector. One of the great developments coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the great pivots of 2020, has been the rapid expansion of telehealth services. I welcome the comments from the member for Hindmarsh, but I have a point of difference with him about the rollout of telehealth services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The uptake of new technology has been challenging for the best of us. However, as they so often do, our medical and healthcare practitioners have taken this in their stride. They should be congratulated for their adaptability and responsiveness. Due to the program's success in telehealth medicine, and in the interests of safety in protecting both our doctors and patients, this has now been extended to 30 June 2021. The government has consulted extensively with peak bodies and members of the medical and health profession to ensure the staged and proportionate integration of healthcare services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year on 27 November the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Greg Hunt, flagged that telehealth in the long term will become a permanent addition to Australia's Medicare system. I look forward to this commitment being secured and I congratulate the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Greg Hunt, on the excellent work that he has done in initiating a very rapid rollout, in 10 weeks, of something that could have taken 10 years in a normal period of time to be rolled out. I understand that he is working very hard with the sector to make sure that the rollout goes smoothly and that it is sustainable in the long term. But certainly with 3.3 million video consultations and 41 million phone consultations provided last year it is clear patients and medical practitioners alike have taken up telehealth with enthusiasm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While telehealth will never replace the more attentive and important care given in an in-person consultation, it fills a key gap in our health system. Whether you are travelling hundreds of kilometres, if not thousands of kilometres, across this wide continent to see your medical practitioner or in particular, your specialist, or whether you are sitting for hours in congested traffic in our major inner cities, telehealth provides an efficient and rapid way for patients to connect with doctors. We know this will improve the effectiveness. As a paediatrician, I know that parents sometimes have to take time off work in order to take their child to an appointment and to sit for hours in a medical practitioner's rooms—and, yes, I would say that I was responsible for some of that sitting as, even though you do try to be effective and efficient as a medical practitioner, sometimes the wait can be long. Telehealth provides the ability for people to be able to care for themselves and their families and to be able to do this in an efficient and effective way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do however think that it is important that we focus on telehealth utilising video technology. At the moment, telehealth is predominantly phone based, with 80 per cent of services being provided by phone. This is where my views differ from those of the member for Hindmarsh, in that I think that percentage should be 80 per cent videohealth. The reason for that is that we know many cues come from a video experience. By not allowing that to be the most important aspect of the telehealth services means that medical practitioners are potentially missing out on some important cues that they may receive via videoconference. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do understand that older Australians may not be as technology savvy as some might believe, but I think that older Australians have been enthusiastic with their uptake of things like telehealth and that, once they have seen the light, so to speak, with regards to videohealth, they will enthusiastically embrace it. We need to make sure that this is transitioned carefully and that there is support to ensure that the videohealth links are secure and safe and that privacy is also maintained. But I do believe that these things can be addressed and certainly should be addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to bulk-billed appointments via phone or video don't just benefit Australians in accessing their regular appointments in a pandemic but also help ensure that people, who perhaps have depression or are unwell, who do not wish to or cannot wish to leave their homes—particularly in cold winter months in Melbourne—are more likely to access health care. That is very important for early intervention and is very important for secondary prevention to prevent readmissions when people have been home from hospital. Too often Australians, particularly those living with chronic health disease or with disabilities, and especially those with fluctuating conditions, will face delays in accessing health care and that can potentially compound their conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During COVID one of the reasons that telehealth facilities were rolled out was to protect health practitioners as well. It meant that, in that swift crisis that we all faced, we were able to ensure that, when we were facing difficulties with PPE and mask acquisition, we could keep our frontline workers as safe as possible. So the use of telehealth has had a myriad of uses throughout the COVID pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The use of telehealth is about protecting the most vulnerable members of our healthcare network. It is jointly about guaranteeing that vulnerable patients can receive continuity of care and advice. The expanded use of telehealth will undoubtedly be a positive legacy piece of the COVID-19 pandemic and one that all Australians should feel proud.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also implementing the most significant reforms to private health insurance in over a decade, which is making private health insurance simpler and more affordable. From 1 April 2021 the government increased the maximum age of dependants for private health insurance policies from 24 to 31 years and removed the age limit for dependants with a disability. I cannot emphasise how important this will be to ensuring that young people maintain their private health cover, particularly if they've been part of their family's private health cover. This is part of the government's commitment to ensuring private health insurance is affordable and provides value for money for its consumers. This serves the additional purpose of encouraging young Australians to continue with private health insurance when they reach the age of 31—the age at which lifetime health cover commences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My son is an example of this. He was on our family cover. He is a young man who has epilepsy. Unbeknownst to us he allowed his private health insurance to lapse. During that period of time he was trying to access a neurological appointment and took a long time to receive an appointment. In the meantime he was on the wrong dose of his antiepileptic medication. He suffered a seizure, a generalised convulsion, which can be quite dangerous. So because he allowed his PHI to lapse he actually put his own health and life at risk. I am delighted to say that he will now be able to be incorporated into our family health cover. And hopefully as a young man, who has only just commenced employment in the workforce, he may see the benefits of private health insurance going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This gap between 24 and 31 years of age is often the time that young people are going out into the workforce. They have a lot of additional expenses. They are saving, hopefully, for their first home—as a member of Goldstein would be very pleased to hear—and they also have difficulties with job security. So PHI or private health insurance is often not their No. 1 expense. I think this extension is a very welcome extension. I think it will be a benefit, ensuring that people who wish or choose to invest in private health insurance will continue that coverage from their family coverage onwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has worked hard to ensure the vitality of our healthcare system before, during and now after the COVID-19 pandemic; although, I note we're still not out of the woods yet. This minor but worthwhile amendment to prescribed fees is a welcome change, which will abolish this administrative imposition on medical practitioners. This is great news for our healthcare system, its practitioners and ultimately for patients. I commend the bill to the House. Thank you.</span>

                    <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>): First of all I would like to acknowledge the contribution by the Member for Higgins. I would also like to acknowledge the Member for Lyne as being, with myself and the Member for Higgins, one of three people who have direct knowledge of this particular amendment. I would like to commend the shadow minister for health, Mark Butler, for his deep understanding of our healthcare system and knowledge of this particular amendment. As with many things that this government does, we support the amendment but understand that this is tinkering at the edges of a healthcare system that is under increasing stress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is good as a specialist to receive your specialist acknowledgement by achieving the fellowship of your royal college, be it the college of physicians or the college of surgeons or psychiatrists or whatever specialty. That's very important and a great part of our joy in receiving specialist recognition. But part of that also is the time when you can get specialist recognition for payment through Medicare. I remember in 1983 having to get either a bank cheque or a money order rather than a personal cheque to pay my contribution for this. Every specialist really waits for that moment and it is a really important time. The fact that we are now allowing it to happen in a much more ordered and modern way is really correcting an anachronism that should be long past, as the shadow minister commented. However, it is tinkering at the edges of what is a very significant problem in our healthcare system, and that is access to higher level specialist care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the board we see in Australia a degradation in life expectancy from inner-city and metropolitan to outer metropolitan, rural, regional and remote areas. Life expectancy gradually decreases along that line. Access to higher level care increasingly is restricted to people living in inner metropolitan areas. We see that in a whole range of mortality and morbidity figures. With the advent of modern health care, we are seeing increasingly complex procedures available. For things like for coronary artery disease, urgent stent insertion is now the treatment of choice and has contributed markedly to a reduction in mortality and, indeed, a reduction in morbidity in our major capital cities. This is less and less available the farther we move from the inner city of all our major capital cities. These treatments mean that people live longer and are able to return to the workforce following a heart attack much more quickly and with much less disability. We see those available increasingly in our capital cities, but it's still a major difficulty in our rural and regional areas and also in our outer metropolitan areas. There are new treatments—for the management of stroke, for example, with clot retrieval—which are essentially available only in our inner cities on a regular basis, and little effort is being made by the government to try to provide these higher level medical services to outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas. There seems to be little acknowledgement from the government of the difficulties in getting these procedures made available to all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One issue that the government has spoken about is the increases in Medicare payments to GPs living in rural and regional areas. Yet, for the last five years, I have been writing to the minister for health, explaining to him how difficult it is to recruit GPs to our outer metropolitan areas. More recently, the changes to the area-of-need classifications for the outer metropolitan areas, as the shadow minister for health spoke about, are making it very, very difficult to recruit general practitioners to our outer metropolitan areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Macarthur, one of the fastest-growing electorates in the country, I have general practices contacting me every week saying they can't recruit GPs to work in their already overburdened clinics, which puts enormous pressure not only on our patients but also on our public hospitals, which are now being used as general practices by many people because they can't access general practice care. This is a failure of the government to understand that their responsibility is to deliver the best health care they can to all Australians, not just some. This is, again, a failure of understanding the importance of health care to everyone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other issues that the government is also failing on. The member for Higgins mentioned private health insurance. Some of the changes that the government recently made to private health insurance, in particular in the area of disability, allowing people with disability to remain on their parents' health insurance indefinitely, have been very important changes. But it is too little, too late. The numbers in private health insurance are dropping, which is putting more and more pressure on our public health system, which the government seems to be quite happy to let happen, without any real move to improve the viability of private health insurance for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of technology, the government's idea of how My Health Record is working is deeply flawed, yet there is little commitment from the government to try and improve our electronic healthcare records. This is very poor. This is the future of health data, and how we store and use that data is increasingly going to impact on all our health care as the future evolves. Yet the government has done nothing to improve My Health Record, to the point where the whole system needs to be redesigned and re-established because the majority of Australians are not using electronic healthcare records. This is increasingly important as we develop an understanding of the genetic nature of disease and how we apply that to health management across a whole range of fields, from cardiovascular disease to obesity and diabetes, to cancer therapy and cancer management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget—this is another piecemeal measure—the government has put in some funding to provide support for breast cancer genetic screening. That's very important but it's only part of the answer. There is no commitment from the government to an overall picture of gene and cell management. We need to be doing this as a whole-of-health approach, not just as a piecemeal approach all the time. That's what we get from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, it's not just in electronic health records and other technology; little is being done to support the telehealth and telemedicine regime. The recent changes were announced by the minister without consultation and without any proper engagement with the healthcare workforce, yet this is going to be a very important part of our health future. This should have entailed consultation with a whole range of health providers—not just doctors and general practitioners but specialists, nursing staff, allied health staff, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. A whole range of options could be made available to try and improve our telehealth system, futureproofing it and enabling the expansion of services for the benefit of all patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Telehealth is not just very important in rural and regional areas; it's very important in electorates like mine, which have a high level of disadvantaged patients, a high level of Indigenous patients and a high level of people with disability. Access to telehealth is very important and should have been expanded by the minister, with support given to practices to establish more telehealth facilities. The ability to conference telehealth and engage other practitioners for case conferences et cetera should have been expanded. As a paediatrician I found access to case conferences vitally important for my patients, often those with multiple disabilities. A process should have been put in place by the minister to allow this to happen rather than restricting access to telehealth practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, whilst this amendment gets agreement from both sides of the parliament, it's piecemeal, it doesn't look at the overall health picture and it could have been done a whole lot better with a philosophy of improving health care for all Australians. If you live in the inner city it may well be that you get good access to a whole range of health services, but, in outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas, access to high-level specialist care is increasingly being rationed, and the health outcomes in terms of both mortality and morbidity are being paid for by some of the most disadvantaged groups in our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change is a very small change. Whilst I welcome it, I want the government to look at putting in more processes that enable high-level specialist care to be given to people living in rural, remote and isolated areas. It can be done. Teaching-hospital-level health care should be available to everyone in Australia. There are ways of doing this. The health cardiology bus that is used in remote and regional areas of Queensland to provide high-level cardiac care to the teaching-hospital level should be available across the country. Our most remote Indigenous families should have access to high-level eye care, high-level ENT care and high-level cardiovascular and diabetes care. We know that can be done with a commitment from a government that philosophically understands the importance of universal access to the best health care possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has approached the whole health issue in a piecemeal and very political way, without a philosophy of providing the best care to everyone. We've seen rollouts of some innovative health policies occurring in very advantaged communities and not in disadvantaged communities. Once again, the health workforce is not being evenly supported across the country. In my own area, the electorate of Macarthur, we have had major problems recruiting GPs to work in our GP clinics, major difficulties recruiting specialists to work in our hospitals and major difficulties providing tertiary-level health services in the outer metropolitan area. There are ways of doing this much, much better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we support this amendment, the government needs to do more to support health care for all Australians. In particular, we need to look to the future and we need to futureproof our health care for everyone. That means a commitment to electronic healthcare records for everyone, a commitment to supporting telehealth, a commitment to supporting the most disadvantaged and, overall, a commitment to supporting our workforce that has supported us so well throughout the pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons Australia has done so well in the pandemic is our health workforce. I don't just mean the epidemiologists and the infectious-diseases consultants; I mean the nursing staff, the contact tracers and the IT specialists—the people who work on the ground to make sure we are all protected. I really thank them so much for this, but we need more from the government for overall health care as we emerge from the pandemic so that there is justice for all within our health system. I thank the House. I thank the shadow minister for his amendment, and I reiterate our approval of it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282982" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MARTIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Health Insurance Amendment (Prescribed Fees) Bill 2021. The bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 to remove the requirement for new specialists and consultant physicians to pay a prescribed fee when applying for recognition for higher Medicare rebates. It reaffirms the Morrison government's commitment to cutting red tape and ensuring better access to health services for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is a small amendment, but the changes will ease the bureaucratic process for recognition as a new specialist or consultant physician for Medicare purposes under the Health Insurance Act 1973. It does this by removing the requirement to pay a $30 fee to gain access to higher Medicare rebates. As it stands at the moment, the current pathway to recognise a specialist or a consultant physician requires a medical practitioner who has gained fellowship with a specialist medical college to supply to Services Australia for access to higher Medicare rebates. As part of this process, the medical practitioner must pay the prescribed fee, $30, via money order or cheque. Only then can the application be processed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This simple amendment will reduce the cost and processing times for new specialists and consultant physicians to be recognised for Medicare purposes, therefore providing more efficient patient access to higher Medicare rebates. During the COVID crisis, it became apparent that this method of payment was impacting specialist and consultant physician recognition for the purposes of Medicare. This was mainly because neither method of payment was efficient or practical during movement restrictions and in-person service closures. As a result, patients of new specialists or consultant physicians may not have been able to receive higher Medicare rebates when they were entitled to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes will not only remove costs for physicians and provide better access for patients; they will also make it easier for Services Australia to more efficiently process applications from new specialists and consultant physicians, ensuring earlier access for patients to higher rebates. If this change is not made, patients of new specialists and consultants may not be able to receive higher medical rebates during any future movement restrictions and/or reductions in in-person service availability. In the past, this requirement has delayed access to higher Medicare rebates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has done a lot to assist with patients access to better health care. More Australians are now seeing their doctor without having to pay. Nearly nine out of 10 visits are free. The GP bulk-billing rate was 89.3 per cent in 2020, compared to 81.9 per cent in 2012-13, Labor's last year in government. In total, there were 440 million Medicare services last year, with $25.9 billion in total benefits paid. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have extended Medicare subsidised telehealth services, enabling more than 50 million consultations since the crisis began. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, this amendment, which is a rather simple and small amendment, will reduce red tape and improve efficiency so patients have better access to health care. We don't want our doctors consumed with paperwork. We want them to treat patients. I support the changes. </span>

                    </a>  The modernisation of payment systems is really important, particularly in COVID, when we need to upgrade our payment systems to make them as contactless as possible. I think that's very important. In his contribution, particularly in his second reading amendment, the shadow minister for health went to the broader issues that surround doctor training and workforce development. I'm going to take this opportunity to make a contribution on those broader issues, which are canvassed in the second reading amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes to the Modified Monash Model for how we pay GPs is a disgrace. The fact that they have changed the classification of regions like mine has had a huge impact on bulk-billing rates. The cut to the bulk-billing incentive has had a direct impact on my electorate. For example, I had a roundtable discussion last week with GPs. They reported that it has cut payments to GPs salaries by $9,000 a year. That's on top of the fact that GPs have had a pay freeze for many years under this government. This government is continuing to diminish the value of GPs and, by attacking their remuneration, is making it a lot less attractive to GPs to train and go through the long process of becoming a GP. So we're seeing that cut impacting on the workforce. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, the implication for GPs is that, if they want to stay in business, they're going to have to increase the number of patients that pay a gap. In fact, GPs reported to me that, before the cut to the GP bulk-billing incentive, they were running at about 80 per cent bulk-billing and 20 per cent non-bulk-billing. That's reversed. They are now only bulk-billing 20 per cent for their patients. To quote one GP, this payment cut was 'the straw that broke the camel's back' in terms of their focus and commitment to bulk-bill. That's incredibly tragic. It's undermining the entire Medicare system and it's incredibly counterproductive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicare is based on access to health care being based on need, not financial ability. We canvassed this issue when this government launched another attack on Medicare, which was the attempted introduction of the $7 co-payment charge. In testimony to a Senate inquiry into that, the Department of Health quantified the cost savings from it. They quantified that it would avoid four million visits to GPs per year. It was able to quantify that, if just one in 50 of those people who avoided visiting the GP presented to a hospital emergency department, the savings would be wiped out. The tricky bit is that the savings would accrue to the federal government, while the cost increases for EDs would be borne by the state government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing an attack on preventive health and an attack on primary care under this government. That's having a huge impact on the Medicare system, and that's why the second reading amendment from the shadow minister is so important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another part of what GPs raised with me last week was the issue of the lack of ability to see specialists through the public system. These GPs said to me that they've basically given up on referring their patients through the public system to specialists because the wait can be up to four or five years. That's catastrophic. The most tragic case I heard was of a five-year-old boy who has been on the waiting list to see an ear, nose and throat specialist for two years. He's got constant ear infections, which are impacting on his hearing, impacting on his ability to learn and leading him to be further and further behind his classmates. He's been on the waiting list for two years. This is something that has an easy fix. While I'm not a doctor, I understand that grommets are probably the preferred course of treatment. Having had grommets, I can say that they did help with my particular issue. I try not to be too personal or to give false advice, but this GP said that grommets would provide an easy fix to this poor boy's situation. But he's been on the waiting list for two years and is likely to have to wait another two years to get the grommets. During that time he will be falling further and further behind his classmates. His potential to make the greatest contribution he can to our society is being diminished because of this. Ultimately, I would submit, the economic cost of the loss of potential of that young boy's life, from a purely economic point of view, outweighs any cost savings from this government's continued attack on the ability of people to see specialists through the public health system. That was another issue that was raised in this particular forum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third issue—and I'll finish on the third one—is the issue of bonded doctors. A number of doctors have come to see me concerned about the incompetence displayed by the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the Department of Health in managing the transition of the bonded doctors system. These doctors said to me that a couple of years ago they received notification from the Department of Health that the way doctors were bonded was changing. Instead of having to provide six or seven years of service as bonded doctors going to rural and remote areas they only had to do three. Therefore, they received a certificate saying that they had acquitted their service. Now the Department of Health has come back to them and said: 'We made a mistake. We're changing back to that. And, by the way, for the two years that you weren't doing your rural or remote service, because we told you didn't need to, we're now going to go you and you're possibly going to lose your Medicare provider number,' and a whole lot of other catastrophic things that would mean that these GPs and other doctors wouldn't be able to practise for 12 years. This is symptomatic of a government that can't manage the healthcare system. They can't manage primary healthcare, they can't manage the ability to make sure that people can see a doctor when they need to and not have to wait till when they can afford to. I'll end my contribution there. I commend the bill, with the second reading amendment, to the House. It covers some important areas of the health system.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  I thank my colleague, the member for Shortland, for speaking earlier than perhaps he thought he might on this bill because I was a little late into the chamber. I rise to speak on this bill, the Health Insurance Amendment (Prescribed Fees) Bill 2021. As those speaking before me have said, Labor supports this bill. There is a second reading amendment which talks about GPs, and I want to take the opportunity to speak on the legislation because there are a number of issues relating to GPs and health services in my electorate of Dunkley that I am incredibly eager for the government to take up and either support or fix.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first relates to something that my colleague who was speaking just before me, the member for Shortland, was speaking about, and that is lack of access to GPs. In particular, this is an issue in outer suburban areas. My seat of Dunkley is an outer suburban seat. I have spoken before about the GP clinics that are finding it just impossible to get Australian trained GPs to come and work at their clinics. They have been relying on GPs from other countries and are now finding themselves in quite dire straits because they cannot keep GPs employed. As I have raised with the Minister for Health and Aged Care and have spoken about in this chamber before, the main issues are that, as an outer suburban area, we're not classified as a distribution priority area; that the removal of Medicare incentive payment 10981 causes financial difficulties and is a disincentive for doctors staying in bulk billing clinics, as opposed to going into private practice; and that clinics would like to see options for sponsoring doctors from overseas, because they can't hire locally—this was difficult before the pandemic and is even more difficult now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate that these are not simple issues to resolve but, in the end, the clinics that I'm talking about are in places like Carrum Downs and Frankston and look after people who rely on bulk billing. They look after some of the most socioeconomically disadvantaged people in the broader Melbourne area. We know that, in the community of Frankston, we are just so far below the rest of Melbourne, the rest of Victoria and the rest of the country in regard to a lot of the health measures and in terms of life expectancy. There are issues with alcohol and other drug addictions. Diabetes is a significant issue. I could go on and on. We need good GPs and really good GP clinics that bulk bill. It's an issue that I've been raising for way more than 12 months now, and I'll continue to raise it. It's an ongoing and serious issue in my community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that we have in my community that is not being addressed by the federal government and that charities, the not-for-profits, have had to step in and address—it has been raised with the minister of health, because it's also operating in his electorate of Flinders, but I'm yet to see any government support for it—is access to paediatricians for children from disadvantaged areas. There is a real problem with children from lower socioeconomic areas not getting in to see paediatricians. I can't even believe I have to say that sentence out loud in the federal parliament. That just should not be the case. The Menzies organisation, as a charity—with an amazing local man named Kevin Johnson, who is part of it—is providing paediatricians in schools. They are now servicing 22 schools with paediatricians in the broader Mornington Peninsula, including the Frankston area. From 27 January year until 1 April of this year alone, in term 1, there were 323 appointments for children to see paediatricians, including appointments for 85 new patients, often, particularly for those 85 new patients, for the first time—the first time ever that they had seen a paediatrician in their young lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, the Paediatricians in Schools Outreach Program is out of Mahogany Rise Primary School, which also services Aldercourt, Seaford Park, Kananook and Monterey Secondary College; and out of Karingal Primary School, which services Frankston East, Ballam Park, Karingal Heights and Kingsley Park. This is a program that is providing essential care for children who need it now. It also provides that crucial preventative health care that not only enriches the lives of the children but also has so many benefits for the community and for the bottom line of health budgets. This is done by Menzies in conjunction with Peninsula Health through donations alone. As I said, it is not supported by government funding. I'm hopeful, because I've lobbied for it, that when we have the opportunity to go through the detail of the measures in the health budget that I will find some money in there for this essential and amazing program, but certainly it hasn't been announced. My serious concern is that the Minister for Health and Aged Care, whose electorate this program operates in, hasn't seen fit to support it. That's why I wanted to speak on this legislation. It's a terrific program and I really urge the government to support basic health care for young children who otherwise would not get it in my community and in the electorate of Flinders.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  The Health Insurance Amendment (Prescribed Fees) Bill 2021 simplifies the administrative processes for the recognition of specialists and consultant physicians by Medicare under the Health Insurance Act. It does this by removing the prescribed fee of $30. As the member for Hindmarsh and other speakers have noted, the current pathway in the act to recognise a specialist or a consultant physician requires a medical practitioner who has gained fellowship with a specialist medical college to apply to Services Australia for access to higher Medicare rebates. As part of this process, a medical practitioner is required to pay a prescribed fee of $30 via cheque or money order. One wonders how we got so out of date that this is still the process. Rather than just being out of date, this method of payment became difficult during the COVID-19 crisis and in particular during movement restrictions. This had a massive impact on specialist and consultant physician recognition for the purpose of Medicare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government explored the option of implementing more modern payment methods for these fees but the costs of such an upgrade were assessed as far greater than the loss in revenue from scrapping the fee. As a result, the government has elected to remove the fee entirely, which this bill gives effect to. Labor supports this measure as it will remove a barrier to better building the specialist medical workforce that Australia needs. But, again, how tiny a tweak is this. After eight long years of Liberal government, this, unfortunately, is the type of reform that we get. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear, the government have failed on their two jobs with regard to health care this year. The first was the speedy, effective rollout of the vaccine; and the second was a safe, national quarantine system to protect returning Australians during the vaccine rollout. This government and this Prime Minister are failing on both measures. The Prime Minister has said that the vaccine rollout, in his words, 'is not a race'. Well, I disagree. It actually is the race of our lives. You cannot have a first-rate economic recovery with a third-rate vaccine rollout. This government has missed every target it has set. The Prime Minister promised four million Australians would be vaccinated by the end of March. After failing that target, the government's next target was six million Australians vaccinated by 10 May. With only just over 2.5 million vaccinations completed, 1.7 million of which have been delivered by the federal government, Scott Morrison has again utterly failed in achieving his own target. Frontline healthcare workers, aged-care workers and disability residents—all in the government's 1a rollout—were all supposed to be vaccinated by Easter; yet so many of them are still to receive their jabs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At 400,000 doses per week, it will take two years for everyone to be protected from the virus—two years! The Prime Minister has been saying for weeks now that the vaccination program was ramping up. Well, it had better ramp up a mighty steep ramp, because he has no record of delivering on anything that he says he will. It's heartbreaking for so many people in our economy who need our borders open and who are relying on the rollout of the vaccine for their businesses to survive. It is heartbreaking for people who fear another lockdown and the pressure that that puts on their livelihoods and on the economy. It is negligent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this virus is already mutating. There are variants spreading right through the world now that will probably require populations to receive a booster shot. But, in order to get the booster shot, we have to first be vaccinated. I grant you that, but countries like the UK are preparing for booster shots as early as September and October. I'm already being asked by doctors and other people in my electorate what the plan is for booster shots. Have we bought booster shots? Are we yet negotiating with companies to have them onshore, ready when they need to be given, or are we going to be left at the back of the queue again just as we were with the vaccines? I note, significantly, that it appears that there was no money allocated for boosters in the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the vaccine rollout in aged care, it's been nothing short of a disaster. Families and residents have been constantly asking me when their residential aged-care facilities will receive the vaccine. I have had heartbreaking phone calls from people who have seen the state publicly run facility in a regional town get all their doses for the staff to be vaccinated and for the families to be happy and content that their residents are safe, while a privately run facility down the road that is in the purview of the federal government has no idea when the vaccines will be rolled out there. The public health networks are in the dark as much as we are. It's pretty crook when aged-care providers are ringing me and other local members to find out when their facilities will be getting their vaccinations. They can't find out that information from the federal government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are hearing stories of nursing homes being all set up, the residents all primed, the families all informed and the staff all ready to roll out the vaccinations, but no-one turns up. One aged-care facility told me recently that they went through the whole process. They lined everybody up—they had 160 residents—and everybody was getting a vaccination, until there were about eight residents left and they ran out. That facility had to tell those eight residents and their families that they had to miss out, with no plan to come back and no plan to make sure that those residents actually got the vaccination in the end. It was reported on the ABC that one aged-care facility, TLC—which actually have a facility in my electorate—decided to take the vaccination of their residents and their staff into their own hands. Their CEO, Lou Pascuzzi, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We really didn't want our residents, staff or contractors to endure another winter with the nervousness and trepidation that they have endured over the last 16 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We've got immunisation capabilities and primary care capabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We decided to approach the government … and ask for permission to administer phase 1a ourselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That says a hell of a lot about the government's ability to roll out the vaccine to our aged-care facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other job the federal government had was to provide a safe national quarantine system, a responsibility that has been the Commonwealth's for more than a century. The hotel quarantine system that was put in place last year is not a long-term solution. What the Prime Minister needs to do is build a network of dedicated facilities around the country that are fit for purpose. This is a government which only acts when it has its back to the wall.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even after all the horrors of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, the Prime Minister still hasn't acknowledged that it was his cuts to the aged-care sector that have led to the crisis. The Prime Minister expects us to congratulate him for last night's budget announcements, but the truth is the package handed down last night still has huge gaps that leave our residents in aged care wanting. As someone who has spent a long time campaigning for aged care, I don't believe this budget package is the generational reform that the royal commission wanted and that the system so desperately needs. It seems to me to be more untied funding for providers that lacks proper wage increases for new nurses and carers. The Prime Minister must explain why he has refused to accept recommendations that require a registered nurse to be on duty at all times in nursing homes, why the government have refused to act to help increase the wages of nurses and carers, why they have failed to implement a registration program for carers and why the Prime Minister has not committed to implementing a comprehensive workforce plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, there is no plan to ensure real accountability and transparency of taxpayers' money. There is nothing that seriously reforms the system to see exactly where the money goes, no change to the auditing requirements to stop money being funnelled away to Maseratis and offshore tax havens or secret family trusts, when residents are not being fed properly or are in soiled clothing and can't get access to proper care. As for the promises of staffing guarantees—two years down the track, mind you—and other promises made for aged care, given the huge gap between this Prime Minister's announcements and delivery, why should older Australians and their families trust him to follow through and fix his broken system?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On another point, I am a nurse, and I have been thinking a lot recently about preventive and primary health care, because that seems to be a term that this government rarely uses. There was practically nothing in the budget for preventive health care. As a nurse I was trained to consider the social determinants of health. That means your economic circumstances play a major role in your health outcomes and need to be dealt with if we are to have a healthy nation. Study after study shows that investing in primary health care and preventive health is far cheaper and more effective than waiting for people to end up in hospital, in our tertiary care system, which is resource intensive, overrun and very much more expensive. It is literally the old 'fence at the top of the cliff rather than the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff' argument. It is a no-brainer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need bolder thinking. We need healthcare reform. We need better and longer access to general practitioners, where there is a crisis of shortages. We need more access to nurse-practitioner led care, where appropriate, to improve reach and health outcomes. We need easier access to allied health practitioners, healthier kids with wraparound services attached to schools, more community led health care, with community health centres, and investment in Aboriginal health community care. We need so much more from a government when it comes to our nation's health. We need to bolster the health of the nation. And on this day, International Nurses Day, I would like to say a great big thankyou to all the nurses in Australia, who worked so hard to keep us safe during the COVID crisis and who work hard every day to keep the health of our nation in a better state.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="72184" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  I rise in support of this very practical bill, the Health Insurance Amendment (Prescribed Fees) Bill 2021. This bill reforms the requirement that an emerging, soon-to-be-registered specialist medical practitioner or consultant physician has to pay a $30 fee. Having gone through 10 years of advanced training, being approved by the relevant college, being approved by the specialist advisory committee in that subspecialty and applying to AHPRA—going through all those checks, balances and quality assurance mechanisms—there is a $30 fee at the end of all that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The department which administers the Health Insurance Act has realised that the digital transfer cost to bring this into the digital age, for each emerging specialist—and there are only so many of them each year—would far outweigh any administrative benefit, given all those other checks and balances. So, hallelujah! A bit of common sense is being applied; they're going to waive this fee. I don't think anyone will object to that, because we have a very good regulatory system—just like we have a very good health budget that was announced last night. It's mind-boggling how much money the coalition government has put into the health budget since we were given the responsibility of governing the nation in 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the COVID crisis the response has been exemplary; around the world, people are looking on in envy at how we responded and how we have avoided the crises other nations are involved in now. Over the last few months, we have had 81 days with no transmissions. That's an amazing percentage. Obviously, there will be transmissions every now and again, but we are increasingly back to near-normal life and that's because we have managed the health crisis well. That's with public health measures, border measures and contact tracing—all of those things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the response is just mind-boggling. We have funded respiratory centres, and private hospital systems have been engaged to cope with any overflow from public hospital systems in the COVID crisis period. Obviously, in this budget we're continuing all these services—all the respiratory clinics, helping with the vaccination rollout, and engaging with the state health systems for them to do their part as well. All this requires an awful lot of taxpayer funds but the coalition government and this health ministry have been right ahead of the curve. The more detail I see, the more practical and clinically beneficial it will be. We have a generational step change in how the federal government intervenes to help with mental health and suicide prevention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a plan—a macro plan and micro details—and now we have money attached. All these plans are great, but if they're not funded they don't deliver the full benefit. I note with great relief that we're going to expand the headspace service, with 54 more places. We're going to expand support for the Head to Health initiative for kids and for adults. All the links to digital support for mental health services are being supported: Lifeline, beyondblue and the Butterfly Foundation. All these issues are really important. Eating disorders are getting much more fiscal support out of this budget—all the services that help people with eating disorders will be really pleased. I recall that, when I was in practice, there were very few services on the whole North Coast that could look after specialised eating disorder patients. There were a couple of very effective units in major centres, mainly in Sydney, but now that we've got all these other allied services in this space it will be so much better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately in mental health, the apogee of it all and the sad bit is when people take their own life or attempt to take their own life because their mental health is disordered and to them it seems like that's the logical way out. But fortunately we do save people from failed attempts. Post discharge, the care after one leaves a place where they've been an inpatient and cared for is a very risky period. The aftercare of people who've gone through a suicide attempt is now addressed in this budget. There will be an aftercare system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're looking at new and innovative treatments, including transcranial magnetic stimulation for refractory depression. This is evidence of the logical plan, as I said. It's all been thought through. We've had three ministers involved in this, including the Minister for Health and Aged Care and Assistant Minister Coleman. It's obviously been a really well thought through plan. We're looking at improving mental health workforce and workplace support, as well as mental health governance of all these arms that we are putting funds into. Also, there are some sections of our country that are at higher risk because things get lost in translation or the services aren't that thick on the ground, particularly in some multicultural groups and in the Indigenous space, so there are extra funds allocated for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I like about this budget, that's been very well received, is the focus on rural and regional health. You might have seen that in the days leading up to the budget we had some preliminary information. The increase in the bulk-billing incentive in a progressive fashion—currently it's at 150 per cent in difficult metropolitan areas. But, in aligning the population size to an increase in incentive, the more remote and regional you go the bigger the incentive. In an area that might have 50,000 people—a sizeable regional town—that would be a modified Monash 3. A big metropolitan centre is Monash 1. A very remote place is a Monash 7. Once you get into a modified Monash 3 it goes to 160 per cent. And then step wise up through three, four, five, six and seven it goes up to 190 per cent extra on the bulk-billing incentive, which will make medical practice much more sustainable in those more remote areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everything is usually more complex there. People tend to get sicker. They have more comorbidities. There is much more responsibility without all the associated support mechanisms that people take for granted when you are in a metropolitan centre: you might have three specialists that you could reach to for help and there's probably a hospital, an accident and an emergency. But when you're in regional and remote Australia all of that falls onto the practice. In many cases they are often a de facto emergency centre. They're an after-hours centre. They have to look after really sick people until they can get evacuated after road trauma or after serious illness that is beyond the capability of a regional or a small, country district hospital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also extra care in the workforce planning and the workforce incentives. As you know, there are some scholarships that we have supported for many years. One of the best ones to get young students training in their basic medical degree is called the John Flynn scholarship, after the fellow who started the Royal Flying Doctor Service. In a sequential way, during their training these students revisit and spend time in the same practice. They get longitudinal exposure to rural and regional practice, because the health workforce in the regional space is probably the biggest challenge. It is a complex area to fill. It's the same issue as for a lot of the other professional services. Trying to get pharmacists and physios in the regions is a lot harder than in a metropolitan place. It's the same with dentists and in other professions for that matter. But in the medical space we have a metrocentric distribution of services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the best markers of a quality health system is easy access to those entry-level primary care services. That's why it is so important that we keep supporting all these rural initiatives. We've got extra funds to have more specialist, non-GP training in regional areas. We have grants to keep regional doctors all doing stuff up to date. They can go and do upskilling courses. It is a continuous and relentless responsibility if you are working as a professional medical operator; you need to keep up to speed. There's support for those doctors to go off and do upskilling. There is the practice incentive program and the Rural Procedural Grants Program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is assistance for rural diagnostic imaging. I went on a trip down the Darling River checking out things, and there are some amazing services in these remote areas of my home state. But to have some up-to-date equipment or the latest technology sometimes is not economic, because the volume of activity in these areas isn't as great. There is a one-off funding pool to assist rural and remote medical imaging, which is generally not government run. It's private providers who do it because they love the country, they live there, they want to be part of the community and they want people in regional Australia to get the same things they would get if they went over to the Canberra Hospital at Woden. So we are trying to correct this disconnect in access to services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also done so much work in this budget over the digital health space, as well as the My Health Record. Having access to health data in a remote area is always very important if you are travelling or moving around for work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a long-term health plan. As I mentioned, there are initiatives for women's health. On the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, there are great announcements—new treatments for osteoporosis, asthma, lung cancer and breast cancer. There's the initiative for funding a trial for triple-negative breast cancer. Tick, tick, tick—they are all really good, practical things that will make a material difference to the outcomes for many people who suffer from very serious diseases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this original bill is a very practical, commonsense administrative initiative which I don't think anyone in this building will object to. It's common sense. I am so pleased that, in the 2021 budget, health is right at the top. To put things in perspective, we've done amazing things. There is a generational step change in aged care as well. That is also in the health portfolio. That is $17.7 billion extra over the next four years that will be going into aged care—$10 a day per resident in a high-care centre will really turn the economics of that around for a lot of long-term, very efficient, longstanding aged-care providers in regional Australia who have been challenged because the economics have changed so much. It's really impressive. There's $2.3 billion in the mental health space. That's $2.3 billion in new initiatives on mental health and for adult, youth and children's treatment centres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Medicare itself, we always guarantee that every budget. But there is also the initiative of telehealth, which has been fantastic for regional Australia. That's been supported with continuing funds. Wherever you go in the health budget, just about everything that people would think is great is there. There are obviously other things, but we have to manage it and get the best value for money for the Australian taxpayer. But overall our health system has been keeping Australians— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Australians</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  The Health Insurance Amendment (Prescribed Fees) Bill 2021 simplifies Medicare administrative processes for recognition as a new specialist or consultant physician for Medicare purposes under the Health Insurance Act 1973 by removing the payment of a prescribed fee on the application. During the COVID-19 crisis, it became more evident that the outdated method of payment of the prescribed fee by cheque or money order was impacting specialist and consultant physician recognition for the purposes of Medicare, as neither method of payment was efficient or practical during movement restrictions and in-person service closures. As a result, patients of new specialists or consultant physicians may not have been able to receive higher Medicare rebates when they were entitled to them. Implementation of the bill means a prescribed fee will no longer be required to accompany an application form for higher Medicare rebates for new specialists and consultant physicians. This removes the cost to specialists and consultant physicians, and the administrative burden on Services Australia of processing the fee.</span>

To this the honourable member for Hindmarsh has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question before the House is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  I rise to support this bill, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Assistance and Other Measures) Bill 2021, and move the amendment circulated in my name:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">"whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(2) calls on the Government to ensure rural and remote students have access to quality continuing education".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian should have access to a world-class education, no matter their postcode. All Australians should have the opportunity to undertake further study should they choose to do so. We know that rural and remote students face extra and sizeable hurdles in undertaking high school and post-secondary education. In fact, I have just met with representatives from the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme, and this was one of the issues that the group of women I spoke to raised with me. Boarding accommodation, living expenses and travel represent some of the major challenges for regional and remote students. We all know, too well, that accommodation can be expensive, especially in inner city and suburban areas, and that affordable accommodation can be difficult to find. Travel from remote and regional areas can also be costly, but we also recognise that travel to reconnect with family can be important for educational success and the successful transition into post-secondary studies. Many have to defer studies because their families are unable to afford to continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why social security measures to assist remote and regional students is a proud Labor legacy. This bill will make administrative changes to the operation of the Aboriginal Study Assistance Scheme, known as Abstudy, and the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme, the AIC Scheme. Both schemes are designed to provide financial assistance to students and their families, helping to remove the barriers to education caused by distance and financial disadvantage. In 2020 the Abstudy scheme assisted about 27,000 students at school, university and TAFE. Over the same period, the AIC Scheme assisted around 13,000 students, some of whom are living in very isolated rural and remote regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provisions in the bill align the tax file number requirements of the two schemes with those under our social security laws. Currently, under the legislation, primary school children are required to submit a tax file number. As a result of these changes, only the parents of the AIC applicants will need to submit a tax file number. Labor does support these changes, ending the bureaucratic absurdity of government agencies asking schoolchildren for their tax file number.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the legislation does provides me with the opportunity to remind the parliament that these two education schemes are Labor legacy programs, introduced during the Whitlam government and its great education reform agenda under the guidance of Kim Beazley Sr. We know that Labor has a great history of equality of access to education. It was a Labor government that provided financial support for students to undertake study and training during World War II. This is our legacy. By contrast, this coalition has again done nothing new for this cohort. These legislative changes are a missed opportunity to introduce real reform of the scheme's administrative processes to fast-track benefits to families that are working to do the best for their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes that ease of access should be the priority of any proposed change for a government with the mantra of reducing red tape. In this case, the government knows that families applying to access the AIC need an online application process. In fact, this was one of the very issues that was raised with me by the isolated children program this morning. It's ridiculous to think that there isn't an online process for these families. They are living in very isolated communities—on cattle stations, on sheep stations and in rural and regional Australia, particularly in rural Australia—and the fact that they have to do this without an online application is just ridiculous and something, you would think, from times gone by.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this legislation is a missed opportunity. Ease of access should be the priority of any proposed change for a government with the mantra, as I said, of reducing red tape. In this case, the government knows that families applying to access the AIC need an online application process. This is just a no-brainer. An update in the current administrative process doesn't require legislative change, just a political will. These families also want the government to recognise that geographic isolation creates additional costs for parents who are educating their children from home. Today, as I said, I met with parents from isolated parts of Australia and, again, there is nothing in the budget to address the concerns of these families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You just need to reflect on the government's continued inaction on this issue and its education policies over the last eight long and tired years. We know that this government is trying to move us to an American-style system of tertiary education. Last year Scott Morrison passed a bill that makes it harder and more expensive for Australians to go to university. Around 40 per cent of students will have their fees increased to $14,500 per year, including in law, commerce, accountancy, economics and communications—doubling fees for some students, particularly those wanting to do humanities. That's more than for people doing medicine and dentistry degrees. It is a ludicrous situation, and I'm afraid it will come home to roost and it will be the people wishing to pursue those degrees who will feel the pain. Fees for law, commerce, business and communication degrees will increase by thousands of dollars per year. Tell me the logic in that. He is making students go into an American-style debt which will have lasting consequences throughout their lives, including in saving for a home. What's more, there is no evidence that studying these degrees will make you less job ready than any other. There is no logic to it. In fact, according to research from Victoria University, people with humanities degrees have higher employment rates than science or maths graduates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Think about the year 12 students who have had a hell of a final year because of COVID. The last thing they need is the Liberals making it harder and more expensive for them to go to university. But that is exactly what is happening. Parents know that getting a great education is a ticket to a great job and a lifetime of opportunity for their children. Labor believes education and jobs go hand in hand. By locking young Australians out of university, Scott Morrison is locking them out of their job of choice. We want every Australian to get a great education no matter where they live. That is essentially what this bill is about—the training they need to get a job, whether that is at university or at TAFE, to get ahead and stay ahead. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are the First Australian students and the Job-ready Graduates bill. Given the enrolment patterns of universities, these changes will be more costly for Indigenous Australians than for non-Indigenous Australians, which is just ludicrous. This is because Indigenous students are more likely than non-Indigenous students to enrol in courses affected by these changes. The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Higher Education Consortium provided data in their submission to the Senate inquiry into the Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020 which revealed a significant impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">2018 data shows over 52% of Indigenous students were enrolled in programs that will be impacted by an increase in student contributions for humanities based disciplines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">This will result in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students graduating with a higher HECS debt than non-Indigenous students and moving into the workforce with a greater financial burden.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">School funding is another example of a coalition government making it harder for Australian families to educate their children, particularly those living in rural and regional Australia. It's been remarkable to watch schools convert to online learning almost overnight. It is a testament to everyone in the sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remote learning has been necessary, but there is no doubt that it's pushing disadvantaged students further behind their peers. Even when it works well, disadvantaged students usually learn at about 50 per cent of the usual rate. That means that they would have lost about one month of learning over two months of remote schooling. This is why Closing the Gap needs to be a priority, and this government needs to commit the resources needed to make it happen. But that certainly did not happen in the budget that we heard last night and have read about today. There is absolutely nothing but rebadged money in the First Nations space, and, despite the rhetoric of the Prime Minister at the beginning of the year, no additional money for Closing the Gap targets. That needs to be said clearly and plainly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be nice if the Prime Minister would take educating children living in rural and remote areas seriously. The Prime Minister should be providing the resources needed to target and reverse the existing disadvantage that children are experiencing living in isolated regions of Australia instead of holding public schools back from their full fair funding. As expected, the coalition government has once again failed to provide the resources needed, even in a time of plenty, to meet the Closing the Gap targets for education. Shame on the coalition government, Prime Minister, when we know that it is education that delivers jobs and lifts people out of poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest data shows a two-year gap in maths literacy between metropolitan and remote students. Our public schools educate more than 70 per cent of our regional students. But, under this government, these young people are missing out. Under the Liberal school funding deals, almost every Australian public school receives far less than its fair funding level. Labor believes every school in Australia should be an excellent school. No matter where you live, parents should be comfortable that they can send their children to a public school down the road where they will get a world-class education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, every Australian should have access to a world-class education, no matter their postcode. But, under the Liberals, our students are falling behind, especially in rural and regional and remote areas. It is unacceptable for anyone to miss out on achieving their potential because of their background, geography, disability or any other educational disadvantage. This bill is a missed opportunity to do just that—introduce genuine reform, reduce red tape and update and fast-track access. That is why Labor has moved the second reading amendment circulated in my name.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMMONDS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  I rise to support the substantive bill in front of us, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Assistance and Other Measures) Bill 2021. It's a pleasure to follow on from the previous Labor speaker. I know her passion for closing the gap. It is a passion of ours on this side of the chamber as well. But a lot of what the previous Labor speaker spoke about is not contained in this bill. In fact, the basic premise of the theme running through her speech—to make it easier for children, in particular from remote, isolated and rural communities, to access education—is contained in this bill. This bill will do exactly that. It will make it easier and streamline the process. If that is her central theme, if that is what she would like to achieve, she need only join us and vote for the substantive bill, unamended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a passion of this side of the chamber to support Australian families. We saw that theme running through the budget last night, when the Treasurer announced the measures he did. Our efforts, like this bill, although it may be technical in nature, to streamline processes so that children have the very best access to education that is possible, are incredibly important. This bill performs that task by making the Student Assistance Act consistent with the social security law. This will lead to improving the effectiveness of the administration of vital schemes such as Abstudy, which provides assistance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, and the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme. I will speak a little more on that later. It is a very important program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although this bill is mechanical in nature, it is important as it continues to improve the way we do things. Before I talk about the specifics of the bill, I want to talk about the importance of this type of bill that is reducing red tape and reducing unnecessary burdens. This is a focus for us on this side of the chamber. It has been a firm goal of the government to streamline processes and reduce regulatory burden, and it is one that we are achieving. I want to compliment the work that my friend the member for Tangney, the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, is doing in this space. He is a passionate advocate for cutting red tape and his deregulation task force is making some real and continuing improvements. I look forward to seeing other bills before this place that continue to achieve that outcome. It is in our DNA to create jobs. It is in our fundamental DNA to reduce regulation and reduce burden to make things easier, and to create smaller government with less red tape and more opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I move to speak on the AIC, Assistance for Isolated Children, Scheme. The scheme helps parents and carers with the extra costs of educating their kids when they can't go to an appropriate government school, which could be for many reasons. They may live in an isolated area, they may have a disability or they may have special needs. The AIC allows them to get financial assistance to help with the additional costs. There are allowances for boarding or for a second home. It gives families options and choices, and that is what this government is all about. We are about empowering our nation's families to make the best choices for their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on the other side of the chamber believe they are best placed to spend your money for you and to make your choices for you. This government believe in empowering families to not only earn more dollars but also make the best decisions for their families. Programs like the AIC help to level the playing field and ensure that families have choices, even if they are in an isolated or remote community. Without it, they would not have the ability to choose their own outcomes and achieve the best education for their kids. The streamlining of the process contained in this bill means these families don't face further unnecessary burdens. It means they will have more help and fewer challenges, something I think even Labor members opposite could support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the pandemic, we may have felt isolated from our friends, our work and our schools. This has given us all a greater understanding of isolation and what it might be like to live in isolated and remote communities. While we don't face those challenges ourselves, it has given us a better appreciation of the many challenges that they face every day. In the midst of the pandemic our worlds became smaller as restrictions saw us isolated and not able to travel, but our outlook became broader. I got many calls to my electorate office from people who were not concerned for themselves but concerned for others. Our community wants to make sure that the most vulnerable among us are looked after—the elderly, those in aged care, our veteran community and, importantly with this bill, our kids. It was a central theme running through last night's budget speech from the Treasurer, the member for Kooyong, for the path to recovery. We have the opportunity with this legislation and the last night's budget to take the challenges of the pandemic and to parlay them into opportunities to put more funding into some of our most vulnerable communities, as we have with massive funding injections for aged care, veterans and mental health. Those kinds of investments dovetail with bills like this one before the chamber, which is also providing opportunities for some of our isolated and vulnerable kids. With that, I certainly commend this bill to the House as part of the government's ongoing commitment to effective and efficient government, to reducing red tape and, importantly, in our efforts to help all Australian families.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to stand here, having seconded the amendment by the shadow minister. Members can rest assured that we are speaking in support of the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Assistance and Other Measures) Bill 2021, but we have proposed an amendment, which is a good amendment, and we would encourage those opposite to support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this bill, which will align the tax file number regime under the Student Assistance Act 1973 with the collection and use of TFNs under social security law. The bill removes the anomaly currently in place which requires all claimants of the two schemes—the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Study Assistance Scheme, known as Abstudy, and the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme, the AIC Scheme, including primary school children—to provide a TFN to Services Australia. These two schemes were designed to improve access to education by reducing financial barriers to higher education and training, which disproportionately affect First Nations people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2020, Abstudy assisted around 27,000 students to pursue further education in school, university and TAFE. We should just pause and reflect on that for a moment. Twenty-seven thousand young First Nations Australians were assisted in furthering their education thanks to Abstudy, which of course is a proud legacy program of the Whitlam government. Similarly, the AIC assisted around 13,000 students. The AIC enables people living in regional areas, including my own electorate of Lyons, to pursue educational opportunities that they might not ordinarily have felt were an option for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the people currently on these schemes, the reforms we are debating today are inconsequential. What Labor is focused on, and what the Morrison Liberal government should be focusing on, is implementing real reform that ensures that benefits can be fast-tracked to families and educational opportunity can be further opened up for people living across regional Australia. For a government whose mantra is supposedly about reducing red tape, I would have thought that this would be a logical aim. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking to this bill, it is important to reflect upon the history of tertiary education in Australia. Labor has a proud history of supporting students to undertake study and training. In fact, financial support to students began under a Labor government during the Second World War. I've stood in this place before and talked about the fact that Labor builds. Unfortunately, those on the opposite side, the Liberals, cut. Labor builds. Liberals cut. Under the Whitlam government Abstudy was reformed into a means tested payment scheme, and the AIC was established to assist students in remote and regional areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is proud to support Australia's youth from regional and remote areas in gaining higher education and training. We fundamentally believe that every person deserves the opportunity for an education in Australia no matter where they're from, and we are committed to ensuring that this opportunity continues. Labor has a very proud legacy in improving education across Australia. We fundamentally believe that every person in Australia deserves the opportunity to pursue higher education and training as well. Skills training is very important, but higher education is equally important for those who wish to pursue it. Labor fundamentally believes that it is a role of government to assist with this aim, and a good government will ensure Australia's higher education sector is truly first class and working for students. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the government. The evidence of that was all too apparent in last night's budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his second reading speech on this bill, the minister said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill strengthens our student support system so that it can focus on the important task of ensuring that Indigenous students and isolated students from across Australia have the opportunity to gain a first-class education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If only this government was truly committed to investing in education and training for people in our regional and remote communities—and you don't invest in higher education when your budget for 2021, over the forward estimates, cuts 10 per cent from the higher education sector. The maths doesn't add up on that. You can't profess to have a commitment to higher education in this country and then slash 10 per cent from the sector over the next four years. It doesn't add up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The comments the minister made about this bill are another example of all talk and no delivery from this government when it comes to higher education. The budget last night—this goes to the shadow minister's second reading amendments—locked in the Prime Minister's policy to make it harder and more expensive for Australians to go to uni. That runs counter to the sentiments of the minister in speaking to this bill. The budget papers confirm for the first time that the government is actually saving money by jacking up university fees and increasing student debt. That's going to be this government's legacy: crushing student debt and cuts to universities; crushing, crippling student debt, just like we see in America, that makes it harder for young Australians to get ahead. It makes it harder for them to save for a home. It makes it harder for them to raise a family. It makes it harder for them to save for retirement. The longer it takes you to pay off your student debt out of your wages means there's less money going into your superannuation account, so you're earning less on the compounded interest over your working life. It gets you when you're young and it gets you when you're old. It is absolutely counterproductive to the national productivity of this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wham—higher fees; wham—low wages; wham—crippling mortgages; and, wham—less superannuation! Australians are being hit at every stage of their lives by this government, including with the cuts that it made to higher education last night. It's a lifetime of kicks to the incomes of Australian workers. Instead of helping young regional Australians get ahead, which is what this bill is supposed to be doing, the Liberals are putting roadblocks in the way. They should hang their heads in shame over the budget they delivered last night for what it does to higher education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does not want Australia to be like America, where our kids have to get a lifetime of debt to get an education. And we are talking about our kids. My daughter is 22. She is graduating this year from university, so she misses out on this, but there are kids just behind her who will be facing very, very high fees. They will have debts of around $60,000 for a basic degree at the same time as they're trying to find work, save a deposit for a house and start a family. What a way to say to young Australians, 'We're on your side.' If you're doing this to young Australians, you are not on their side. The Prime Minister's huge uni fees and huge uni debts will rob Aussie kids of the jobs of their dreams. They are not setting Australian kids up for success; they are loading them up with a lifetime of debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this government is so invested in advancing students in remote regions of Australia, why is it cutting funds from the university sector? As of January this year, more than 17,000 people have lost their jobs at Australian universities since the beginning of the pandemic. Yet the government wants us to believe it is committed to improving our education system. The job losses amount to 13 per cent of the pre-COVID university workforce. That's a massive chunk of a national workforce that this government completely abandoned because they were not eligible for JobKeeper. This government excised them from JobKeeper. So 17,000 people were let go from universities and told, 'You're on your own.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Tasmania, the University of Tasmania has suffered immense financial hardship throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. With around half of UTAS's international student cohort being comprised of Chinese students last year, the closure of international borders and travel restrictions sent shock waves through UTAS and the broader higher education sector. A lot of it was unavoidable, but the real test is what you do about it. When the shock happened and the borders were closed, which had to happen, how should a government have come in and assisted? This government just locked the gates on the universities and said, 'You're on your own.' UTAS was forced to expedite a planned restructure, which led to a cut in the number of courses from 514 to just 120. Staff were offered redundancies, cleaning and security staff were stood down—again, without the protection of JobKeeper—and the broader university community were severely affected by such large-scale change being implemented so swiftly. UTAS needed to implement these changes as a priority matter of sustainability and survival. Their survival was on the line. It is outrageous that Tasmania's only university was forced to go through such turmoil because the Liberals would rather hand hundreds of millions of dollars in JobKeeper subsidies to profitable corporations than provide support to the nation's universities, which had been crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was a show of naked hostility from the Liberals to our traditional learning establishments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While all this was occurring, while universities were struggling to survive, what exactly was the Morrison government doing in the education and training sphere? It wasn't trying to help the sector. It set a mandate to make higher education more difficult to achieve for working-class families. It made it more difficult for people in rural and remote areas, including in my electorate, to achieve higher education. It set a mandate to raise course fees to frankly ridiculous levels, forcing future arts students—I would hazard a guess that most people in this chamber on all sides are arts graduates—to pay up to $100,000 for their degrees. No-one in this chamber has paid that much for their degree, yet we're foisting that legacy upon the kids of tomorrow. If the kids up in the schools gallery are going to do an arts degree in future years, they're facing bills of $100,000. It's an absolute disgrace. Instead of helping universities and the higher education sector during a global pandemic which was adversely affecting the sector, this government took a wrecking ball to higher education, restricting opportunity for people to pursue higher education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Liberal government, access to training and apprenticeships keeps getting worse. The government is making a lot about the fact that apprenticeships are back on the way up. What it doesn't say and what it never says is that, over the past eight years, $3 billion has been cut from TAFE and there are 140,000 fewer apprentices and trainees now than there were eight years ago when the Liberals came to office. The government is increasing those numbers marginally now, but that follows the deep cuts it has already made. Things just keep getting worse under this government after eight long years. They have created a training environment where more people drop out of apprenticeships than complete them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Key industries such as carpentry and plumbing have critical shortages of workers, and this has a flow-on effect to our construction industry and the ability for new developments and new homes to be completed. Australia's skills shortage now is a direct result of this government's incompetent decision to cut $3 billion from TAFE and rely on short-term visa holders from overseas to do the work. Labor is absolutely committed to training young Australians to do this work. The value of TAFE to Australia, to our productivity and to our economy is undeniable. Graduates of TAFE are invaluable to growth in this country, yet this government is failing to resource it properly. We know that it is in the Liberals' DNA to attack TAFE. Even now in Tasmania, the Gutwein Liberal government is seeking to restructure TasTAFE in a way that puts the quality of education and training at risk and leaves wide open the door to privatisation down the track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the Morrison government's complete disregard for the higher education sector, tens of thousands of Australians have lost their jobs. As a result, the education of tens of thousands of students has been adversely affected. We are talking about lecturers, tutors, support staff, staff in the broader university community, security staff, cleaners and admin staff. These are the people who keep the ball rolling in universities across Australia, and without them the education of Australian students is much poorer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will support this bill, but we implore those opposite to support the amendments. The amendments are important. We support this bill and the administrative change that it makes to Abstudy and the AIC Scheme, but we do reject the government's preaching of its commitment to making education more accessible in the regions. The Liberals have a long history of attacking higher education. They have a clear mandate to turn the higher education system in Australia into a mirror image of the United States, a system burdened with debt. And the government has a long history of cuts, cuts and more cuts to the university and TAFE sectors. They don't care for educational opportunity. They don't care about the kids from towns and outer suburbs. They think that uni is for the kids from Kooyong and Point Piper, not Kalgoorlie and Primrose Sands, and their political agenda reveals that. </span>

This bill will help to reduce unnecessary red tape and enhance consistency in the collection and management of information. The proposed changes are needed to improve the effective administration of the Abstudy and AIC schemes and allow the machinery of Services Australia to have a greater level of efficiency. Many students in my electorate of Lindsay rely on these payments to enable them to upskill and take on the opportunities that improve their education and employment prospects. Abstudy helps Indigenous Australians to undertake study and training from secondary school through to postgraduate study, many from remote areas, with study, living and travel expenses. Many of these students must move away from home to study and the Abstudy scheme provides Indigenous students with financial assistance to do so.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The additional assistance provided under Abstudy is specifically targeted at addressing educational disadvantage to close the gap. In 2019-20 the Australian government invested around $320 million in the Abstudy scheme. In 2020 around 27,000 students were assisted through Abstudy. AIC is an ongoing scheme that provides assistance to isolated families whose children cannot attend an appropriate state school due to geographic isolation, disability or other special needs. In 2019-20 the Australian government invested around $83 million in the AIC Scheme, assisting around 13,000 students. These are incredibly important services that make a tremendous difference in the lives of Australians embarking on their own education journey.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Lindsay there are over 6,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Minister for Indigenous Australians and I met—unfortunately it was virtually with COVID last year—with local Indigenous representatives and community health providers to ensure that people in my community were getting the help they needed during the coronavirus pandemic. While we couldn't be there in person, Minister Wyatt recorded a message. It was really quite special because it was around his personal journey through education and to encourage local people, particularly kids in my community, to think about their future and what they want for their own education journey and careers. Minister Wyatt said that if he hadn't followed through on his education and didn't have those opportunities he in fact wouldn't be in this place. He spoke very passionately about the teachers who have influenced him, even from year 1. This set the foundation from an early age to value his education. Minister Wyatt learned to value his education so much so that he got his Bachelor of Education and became a teacher, passing on that lesson to his students and he continues to do that now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education plays a pivotal role in putting kids in our community on the pathways to local jobs, and that is absolutely essential, ensuring that all children in my community of Lindsay have opportunities when it comes to education and then in turn getting into local jobs. I don't see that more than in parts of my community that do wonderful work in supporting kids to stay engaged in school, to keep up their schooling, ensuring that they are supported with things like getting picked up from home if they need to and going to a breakfast club. That's a really important service that's provided to local people in my community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are technical in nature. For example, currently the Social Security Act defines the term 'social security law'. It includes the Social Security Act, the Social Security (Administration) Act and the Social Security (International Agreements) Act, which are the main parts of the social security legislative scheme. This bill amends the definition of the term 'social security law' to confirm that it includes any legislative instrument made under one of the acts, strengthening the Student Assistance Act in matters relating to Abstudy and the AIC schemes, and clarifies the definition of 'social security law'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can see, while these proposed changes are largely technical and mechanical in nature, they are important for the people who rely on these systems to access a quality education, including the Indigenous students in my electorate of Lindsay and those right across Australia, as well as isolated students. It improves efficiencies, delivering a better service. We want all Australians to have access to a first-class education, and these programs ensure that these opportunities are available for more Australians.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:51</span>):  Labor will be supporting this bill, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Assistance and Other Measures) Bill 2021. We have a long history of supporting financial assistance for students to undertake study and training. From World War II through to the Whitlam government's reforming of Abstudy into a means-tested payment scheme and the establishment of the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme to assist students in the bush, Labor has been all about ensuring that kids from disadvantaged backgrounds get the opportunity to study not only at our universities but also at our vocational education centres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This helps to reduce financial barriers to tertiary education and training for First Nations people. Access to education is a key part of the Closing the Gap strategy. Educational attainment is actually one of the areas where there has been some achievement and advance in closing the gap, particularly in the rates of completion of year 12 schooling in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019-20, the AIC scheme assisted around 13,000 students, enabling children living in rural and remote regions to access continuing and appropriate education. For this cohort, the legislative changes are inconsequential, and real reform is needed to ensure fast-tracking of benefits to families. Updating the respective administrative processes of the scheme doesn't require legislative change; it just requires the political will—and that's what has been missing from this conservative government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As of January 2021, more than 17,000 people had lost their jobs at Australian universities since the beginning of the pandemic. If you want to sum up this government's approach to education, look no further than what they did for Australian universities around JobKeeper. I make this point: this government provided JobKeeper to casinos in Australia, yet they denied JobKeeper to universities in Australia. That says everything about their philosophical approach to higher education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that this government is not about assisting students and making it more affordable to get a university education. We've seen that in the fact that they have increased fees across a range of courses, particularly in the humanities, and made it more difficult for kids to pursue their dream of a university education in the humanities. The result has been decreased enrolments in those forms of education. That deliberate approach from this government provides a disincentive to people enrolling in humanities courses in our universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've all seen the job losses that have occurred at universities. I represent an electorate that has one of Australia's most successful and largest universities: the University of New South Wales. There were hundreds of job losses at the University of New South Wales; courses were stripped away because of this government's failure to support the university sector through the JobKeeper payment. Yet the Morrison government stood by while those jobs in that important sector were lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also bad for our economy, because education is usually in the top three when it comes to Australia's exports. We've all seen the success that Australia has had in marketing itself as a destination for foreign students to come to Australia and get a decent education in the Australian tradition. This government's approach to JobKeeper has made that all the more difficult. It's also been made all the more difficult by the fact that it's going to take our economy a longer time to open up than it is for those of other nations, because the government have completely bungled the vaccine rollout. Remember the promise that the Prime Minister made: four million vaccinations by the end of March. They only fell 3.2 million short of that promise. Again, we've seen the commitments that they've made in the budget about having Australians vaccinated. They are now walking away from a time line—understandably, because they can't deliver anything or meet any of the commitments. The states are now starting to say: 'These guys don't know how to run anything. The Morrison government can't handle the administration of the vaccine rollout. We'll take it over ourselves, to try and boost the numbers.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the university sector, we've seen job losses, as I said, and there are more expected to come. Unis have been hit hard by the fallout from COVID and the decline in international students. University education is one of our nation's biggest industries and one of our biggest employers, too, including in the electorate that I represent, but the Prime Minister changed the rules three times to make sure workers in that sector didn't get JobKeeper. They changed the rules to make sure that university staff were not covered by JobKeeper. UNSW was forced to cut 256 jobs last year, impacting many families in our community: academics, tutors, admin staff, library staff, catering staff, ground staff, cleaners and many others trying to make ends meet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Universities are the ones we've turned to during this pandemic. They're the people that we asked to help research and develop a vaccine and the treatments, to look at the ways the disease was spreading in the community and to try and come up with suggestions for government to reduce the rates of infection. Not only do thousands of Australians rely on universities for their jobs, but it's our brilliant university researchers who we've been depending on to develop those treatments to combat COVID. Yet what's the government's thankyou to the sector? What support is the government's providing the sector for doing this vitally important work? We'll deny you JobKeeper, and you guys have to stand on your own, fend for yourselves and try and make ends meet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been 17,000 jobs lost across our nation's universities, and that's a shameful record for this government. It says everything, as I said earlier, about their philosophy when it comes to higher education. Academics and tutors have lost their jobs, as have workers and admin staff and others who keep those universities running. They've all got families and bills to pay. No other industry of this size has been treated with such contempt, as universities have been, by this Prime Minister and his government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we've seen the university sector ignored again in the government's budget. Universities said that they're disappointed with the lack of support for higher education in last night's federal budget, and they're facing another setback, with no return of international students until at least 2023. The chief executive of Universities Australia, Catriona Jackson, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"With borders shut until mid-2022 the picture for universities will get worse—with significant flow-on effects for the nation's research capacity and jobs, inside and outside universities,"</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's an important point to make because there are so many jobs in local communities where universities are situated that are related to the health of the university. I see it in Kingsford, in Kensington, in Coogee, in Maroubra, in Eastlakes and in Daceyville, the suburbs that surround the University of New South Wales, where there have been massive job losses. Small businesses in particular have been unable to survive and cope because the university sector has been decimated. So the effect goes way beyond what happens on the university campus, to many small businesses and communities where universities are situated and to those small businesses that do work for the university sector. It's clear that this budget is yet another marketing exercise that can't hide the fact there's no support for our university sector. This is another missed opportunity from this government to really undertake some significant reform and demonstrate philosophical and real support for higher education in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's vitally needed, because we all know that Australia is falling behind when it comes to our productivity performance. We're actually going backwards; we're one of the few nations in the OECD where productivity in our economy has gone backwards. It's actually the first time in Australia's history, since we began measuring labour productivity, that it's actually fallen, and that's on this government's watch. It never happened under a Labor government and never happened under a previous coalition government either, but it is happening now under this government's watch.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that mean? Ultimately it means that living standards will fall because the income per Australian worker that we're generating is falling. There are a host of reasons associated with that. It's associated with the fact that there has been a dramatic reduction in business investment in Australia as a result of this government's lack of support for research and development and for business investment in Australia—and I'm not talking about the investment that comes from buying a ute or a new freezer for a small business. I'm talking about long-term real investment in new technology, new ways of doing business and the next breakthrough around medical, food technology, horticulture or agricultural research. Those next big breakthroughs aren't being encouraged by this government because of their lack of support for business investment, and that's seeing the productivity of our economy fall off a cliff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that we'll pay for in the future. It means, ultimately, that this large debt we've racked up has to be paid back. It's $1 trillion. Can you believe it or not? Imagine what this government, those opposite, would have done to us if Labor said we were going to institute a trillion dollars worth of debt? That's exactly what they've done; it's the largest budget deficit in the nation's history. How are we going to pay it back when we've got falling and declining productivity, which is going to be a handbrake on economic growth, and make sure that we are getting growth in the economy, more people in jobs, greater income tax receipts and therefore fewer welfare payments? It's not going to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the forecasts that they're making in the budget are pie in the sky without the necessary investment in productivity-enhancing business investment. That is simply not happening in our economy and will not happen under this budget because there is no decent reform there. It's simply a short-term fix to try, really, to get this government through a successful next election. That's what all this is about. It's about them trying to win an election, it's not about the long-term health of the Australian economy and the long-term living standards of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite spending almost $100 billion and racking up a record $1 trillion in debt, the Morrison government is still leaving our universities stranded. While the private and not-for-profit colleges, reliant on foreign students, are receiving a $53 billion lifeline, our public universities, which account for the vast majority of enrolments, are once again mostly passed over and receive nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the government has missed the opportunity in this budget to fully utilise our world-class university system.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Group of Eight CEO Vicki Thomson said that the delay in returning international students has now made it more difficult for universities to play their part in securing Australia's economic recovery. She said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Universities are critical to everything the government has announced (in the budget), whether through our research or the provision of a highly skilled workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She is spot on. There is nothing in this budget that supports that research or the development of skills in our economy. I could go on forever about the skills shortages that we have in Australia because of this government's lack of commitment to higher education and vocational education and training. There are 140,000 fewer apprentices in Australia. Billions of dollars have been cut from the TAFE budget. TAFE colleges are being sold off by state Liberal governments. There is no pathway to securing the skills of the future that we will rely on to, as I mentioned earlier, boost our productivity, encourage business investment and enable us to be the engine room for the next big economic breakthrough that will hopefully spur our economy on into the future. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although we're supporting this bill, it's disappointing that this government has once again ignored the higher education system in the budget, and we'll pay for it in the future.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  What an important opportunity it is today to remember just how important the future of Indigenous Australia is, founded upon the availability of high-quality education. Let's concede that this very minor amendment, which makes it administratively easier for those students accessing Abstudy to be able to be part of education, both secondary and tertiary, is a significant step to making sure that we remove every barrier there possibly could be to Indigenous Australians getting the education they deserve. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget Noel Pearson's great words about both the challenge and the advantage of Indigenous Australians walking in two worlds and doing so confidently, and it's education that allows that to happen. There is every argument that Indigenous Australians can have significant advantages because of their cultural connection to land as well as the Western benefits of an education that need not be Western at all. Today I want to make the obvious point: I see no reason why Indigenous Australians cannot lead, design and deliver their own education system within Australia's. They should be forming parents and friends groups—not just being teacher aides following the advice of Western teachers, but actively designing and co-designing. The member for Lingiari is in this chamber today, having been part of the discussions with the Northern Territory government. It is at the frontline of these challenges. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To take away an administrative concern from, potentially, pursuing tax file numbers from Indigenous Australian minors or their parents is logical, and of course it will have the support of both sides. But it raises the bigger question: while we endlessly debate here the importance of rights, are we as a nation serious enough to admit and can we agree that not only is education a right but it's an obligation of any extended family unit to ensure that all minors of the appropriate age are getting an appropriate education—not just enrolled, not just counting it for the sake of closing the gap, but taking on board that, if a child leaves at lunchtime, starving, we're going to do something about it? Can we commit to having a family commission's approach that says that, if we see children dropping out of education, it is a clear and present emergency to be addressed?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know about the member for Lingiari, but I've been to plenty of community councils in remote communities in Australia where none of those individuals know anything about school attendance, nor have they ever been engaged seriously in the question of how do we keep our children at school? Gone is the time to claim that school is simply not cultural. Gone is the time to say that someone is potentially abusing substances and therefore the rest of the family can't go. Gone are the times of saying that parents simply can't find the shoes to send their kids to school or get out of bed on time to get them there. Gone are these recurrent excuses in a great civil democracy where there are not only rights but also responsibilities to not only confront a problem but seek a way through it. At every level in our social security law, no matter how well we design the back end, it seems that, fundamentally, if someone provides an acceptable excuse for not engaging, it's tools down for the system. It's no longer, 'How do we fix it?' and 'How are you a responsible part of the solution?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I concede that, coming from my background, I may not have experienced a household where you cannot afford a pair of shoes or a school uniform or where a significant family crisis or a health status is such that you simply can't get your children to school. But are we a society serious enough to say that that is an emergency to be dealt with—no more excuses and shoving between agencies or claiming it's another level of government? Are we serious enough as a community to be saying that, if we're going to be an Indigenous cultural council, an elected town council or an Indigenous land council over a region, part of our responsibility is for our minors and seeing that, when they're of the appropriate age, they're in early education, primary and secondary school, and then a community wraps together to get those children through as young adults into tertiary and vocational education?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has to be more important than fighting for grant money and internecine debates over which family benefits. But that's become the new reality. Don't for one minute misinterpret what I'm saying as me blaming Indigenous Australians for that. They had a structured working system over tens of thousands of years that passed on education far more successfully than we did as we tumbled into our own Dark Ages. So the question I ask is: how responsible are we as non-Indigenous Australians for the system that we designed and implemented, the system that moved in from the top and created governance that passed money down to families in remote Australia and then a Centrelink and social security system that effectively undermined individuals and their power by simply paying them a cheque for nothing in return? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What other outcome was likely but a complete disintegration of those kinship groups that have always looked after family? Fundamentally, the Western system never got that. And, by not recognising it, we devalue and demote it and we do not work within those kinship groups to acknowledge that senior men and women have that power if, as a Western government, we're prepared to confer the power. But we don't; we take the power away. We've created community organisations to fight over the money that comes from above—effectively a cargo cult—that activates internecine warfare between families, and we created an individualistic payment system that is blind to kinship groups and families. As anyone, even a person who has visited Indigenous communities as rarely as I have—I have had the privilege of visiting a few dozen—will tell you, if you talk to people on the ground under the tree they'll tell you who's responsible and who's in charge. And, I tell you what, it's probably not the person you expect it to be, but there is someone who can make things happen. But our system has made that almost impossible to deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spent a lot of time thinking these thoughts and talking to Indigenous people about them—it's mostly been in remote and regional areas, where the services taken for granted by the rest of us are not immediately available—and they tell you that these problems are surmountable but that, every time someone tries to crawl their way out of the slippery bucket, they're pulled back in, and we don't have a sustainable solution. The government's tried everything, you could argue. We tried making it an element for the Family Responsibilities Commission in Cape York to monitor and enforce. The end result was that school principals didn't want to enforce school attendance or be the cop on the beat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in this chamber we make a minor administrative amendment to do something entirely sensible, and that is to bring Abstudy and AIC back in line with every other piece of educational assistance—to not require a tax file number. It takes me back 20 years to the mid-1990s. I know that the member for Lingiari was representing the Northern Territory at the time. I was working as a young doctor, learning more about the semi-desert community of Lajamanu. At the time we were pushing out Medicare numbers in a similar way to tax file numbers today. Would you expect traditional semi-arid community people to carry a Medicare card everywhere? It was impossible. The solution was that every Medicare card from the community was stored in a shoebox, and, when they came in and they needed care, we found a way to deliver Western care in a way that was culturally appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I conclude today: what is the solution to what all of us can agree on—and we have to agree on nothing less than the lesson learnt from around the world—which is that, no matter how traditional the community, there is no substitute for a good education?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got to be prepared to change the way we deliver education, and if that means more support for families that most need it to attend school, we've got to be committed to doing it. Removing a tax file number obligation? That's important, because it's a barrier to engaging with the system, but, once through it, our obligation doesn't stop. Our obligation isn't just to enrol students. Our obligation is that students turn up, engage, retain, remain and graduate, and that is a never-ending challenge that every level of government is responsible for, including for those communities that do not talk about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be honest: there is no tougher public policy challenge in a nation as wealthy as this than delivering social security and social services to the remote corners of Australia. This is not a comment about whether or not anyone is Indigenous. It's challenging in every way to deliver those services, but it is right to have an expectation that a child growing up in the most remote corner of Australia can gain a complete education and retain a connection to country, but can leave with confidence knowing they can always return. There are a million ways you can tailor that, but I tell you what we can't accept at the moment, and that is surrendering, giving up on families, doing nothing after visiting a community that says: 'There are always a couple of families that simply never send their kids to school, and that's just how it is. There are a whole lot of kids that turn up for the breakfast, but they're gone by the middle of the morning, and that's just how it is.' There are a whole lot of excuses around support between siblings and family connections where, quite rightly, young people who should be getting an education are forced, through health or another crisis, to be delivering care for extended family members. We need to work with that. In the Western world we found putting schools in hospitals worked. Maybe we have to deliver this differently?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we take a very simple measure and prove that there can be support on both sides of this chamber to remove, let's be honest, a ridiculous requirement that wasn't enforced on anyone else. Long may there be decisions like this. And let us not waste our time in this chamber but ask ourselves really hard questions about why there cannot be 95 to 100 per cent attendance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Closing the Gap targets simply aren't right at the moment. I have made the point that a snowstorm of 16 targets is too many. They're poorly designed, despite how much they have been workshopped. They simply are too heavily focused on administrative inputs. You cannot measure enrolment if you don't care about what they're doing after they're enrolled. It's okay to count graduation, but too many are casualties in between. My academic career, which I began by being part of Australia's greatest education faculty and doing a doctorate in just this area, tells me that you cannot write a family off. You have to take the entire cohort and work with what you have. Not all of them can see a direct line of sight from education to employment, so we need to make sure that is possible. Not all of them are close to an employment opportunity or close to a large metro centre. We need to be imaginative about those empty fly-in fly-out flights that could be taking students into culturally appropriate accommodation for short periods of education with the automatic right to return at any time. Of course it's expensive, but is it more expensive than not doing it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These issues must be put on the table at community level. I'll defer to the member for Lingiari—he's had more of these conversations than I have—but I want to know which communities are serious about this. Take a 100 per cent enrolment, attendance, retention and graduation and work backwards. The minute the first person drops out of that it's an emergent situation. We ask ourselves what's it going to cost to get that child re-engaged? But what does it cost if we don't?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  I acknowledge the contributions which have been made thus far in this debate. I'll come to the member for Bowman in a moment, but I do want to particularly acknowledge the member for Barton, the member for Lyons and the member for Kingsford Smith. It's not my intention to go over the ground they have covered, at least not in any detail, but I will repeat some of the obvious points about the heritage that Labor brings to the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Assistance and Other Measures) Bill 2021 in terms of support for Abstudy in particular, but also financial assistance for students to undertake study and training which, as has been said, commenced under Labor during World War II.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sorry the member for Bowman has left the chamber, as I want to make some observations about his contribution. I will do that shortly. I want to briefly and, in part, repeat two elements of what others have said before I refer to the member for Bowman. In 2020, Abstudy provided financial assistance to around 27,000 students at school, university and TAFE. As has been said, it helps to reduce financial barriers for First Nations people to tertiary education and training. Access to education, as we know, is a key target in closing the gap. I took note of the member for Bowman's observations about both targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme assisted around 13,000 students in 2019-20. I want to make some comments about the Isolated Children's Parents' Association and the wonderful work they do in advocating for students who live in rural and remote communities across this country. They do this pushing stick uphill. It's a very difficult row to hoe and they do it so professionally and well, and they have had significant outcomes over the years. This legislation will assist them, but it won't make a marked difference to the educational opportunities or outcomes for kids from the bush—those who utilise the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we appreciate the commitment of their parents and carers, and school communities that they attend, for what they provide young people in terms of educational opportunities. Some of them do extremely well. I was talking to a pastoralist in the Northern Territory the other day, in sad circumstances. His father had died and the burial was to be held in the local community. He observed that his daughter, who is in her fourth year of medical training, was able to come and be of great assistance to her dying grandfather at the time when he needed close attention and help. That is a commendation not only of that student but of her parents and the wider community and her family. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now go to the member for Bowman's comments. I don't agree with all of his comments or his observations, but I do accept the commitment that he has demonstrated in terms of getting outcomes for First Nations kids wherever they might be, in particular in remote communities. I want to say to him that it is important that we see the connection between other elements of social policy as well as education. He knows this because of his observations and his experience. We can compel kids to go to school as much as we want, but if they don't have the right familial circumstance, if they live in overcrowded housing, the social determinants of health, including education, come into play. I have observed this now over many, many years—too many years to recount, really.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we are prepared to tolerate significant overcrowding in bush communities, where there might be 20 or 30 people to a house, we are going to be forever frustrated in getting decent education outcomes. I do note, though, your observation about giving First Nations people the opportunity to control their educational outcomes. I understand it, and I want to commend the Northern Territory government in this regard. It is now entering negotiations and discussions with First Nations communities around local decision-making, including controlling the school system in their local community. That is a very positive thing. I make the observation that I think there was a mistake in policy introduced some years ago in the Northern Territory where they effectively sidelined bilingual education. In my view that was a grave error. It seems to me that we've got to understand that, if we want to get the educational outcomes to which the member for Bowman referred, we have to engage with the whole community, that's true, but we have also to understand the circumstances in which those communities are situated in terms of their economic and social profiles and to understand the need to put in the resources that are required to get the outcomes that we all want. Those are not just in education but in housing, primary health care, communications and other infrastructure. If we don't do that, we will not get the outcomes that we all want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll say a couple of words on the budget. There is nothing in this budget of any consequence, really. There are two elements. I'm not going to be so churlish as to say they're not decent, but there's nothing substantial in this budget to address the poor educational outcomes of First Nations kids in the bush. There is nothing, zero, zilch. There is nothing in this budget to advance those issues around the social determinants of health, to which I referred—nothing, zero, zilch. There is some money for further primary health care, and I acknowledge the commitment made for the 2,700 additional places for Indigenous girls academies across the country. That just balances the ledger, because of the commitments made for young men's programs. I also acknowledge the commitment to provide $16.6 million for schools and youth support for boarding school viability in 2021-22 post-COVID.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll make an observation. The House of Representatives standing committee on First Nations did an inquiry into education. It looked at boarding facilities and boarding schools across the country and discussed their merit. The conclusion arrived at was that they had questionable outcomes. There were certainly young First Nations students who profited by going to a boarding school, but what we noticed also was that a large proportion of kids who went to those boarding schools dropped out before they'd finished or completed their education. We came to the view that the best way to get better educational outcomes for those kids was to invest in educational opportunities locally, in their own schools and in their own communities. This is where the money should be spent in the first instance. I have no issue with kids going to boarding school if that's what they want. I have no issue with needing to make sure those boarding schools provide good facilities—none at all—but that should not be the priority. The priority should be to look at the fundamental needs of preschool, primary school, high school and post-school education in remote and regional Australia. That's where we should be spending on resources. It seems to me that the government has missed an opportunity in this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that there has been significant comment already in this debate about the impact of the government's budget on higher education and the failure of this government to see that the needs of Australian students are properly addressed. More than 17,000 jobs at universities have been lost because of the Prime Minister's pig-headed decision to stop universities getting JobKeeper. How stupid can you be? Yet that's what we've got. That's sad, and it's a handicap on kids who live in rural and remote parts of Australia, just as it's a handicap on kids who live in major urban centres. The availability of courses and the restructuring of fees that we have seen have already been commented on here. They make huge university fees and university debts that will rob Australian kids of the job of their dreams. That's what will happen as a result of the decisions taken by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go back to where I commenced. There is an opportunity for us here, and I pick up again on the plea of the member for Bowman. Yes, we do have to do things differently, but we have to acknowledge the right of First Nations people to make their own decisions. That's absolutely true. But it requires an investment, and that investment is not coming from this government. The budget last night puts nothing towards local decision-making or investing in the education outcomes of these First Nations kids who live in rural, regional and remote Australia. We're going to have to do a great deal more if we are serious about closing the gap, for which we say we have bipartisan support.</span>

There has been a cloud over the entire period of Ramadan with COVID, in the sense that people haven't been able to gather at the large iftars as they would like to. I certainly hope it's not too long before I can invite people back to Lakemba for the main street night market.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last few days there has been a much darker cloud, as we have seen the events in Jerusalem. I would urge everybody to read the bipartisan statement, released by those who are members of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine group, on Jerusalem and the recent escalation of violence. This parliament has been very strong in speaking out against people going to a place of worship and being fired at with weapons. To see the scenes we've seen outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of the holiest places in the Islamic faith during their holiest month of the year, has been chilling. People often say, 'Do you condemn all acts of violence?' Of course we do, but let's not pretend the escalation didn't come from somewhere. The escalation we've seen is directly connected to the settlement movement, innocently called 'the settlements'. We're talking about people being evicted from their homes, as they were at Sheikh Jarrah. Australia has a role as a nation in the pathway to peace. We should not stand silent.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  On my travels around the electorate of Mallee I have the privilege of meeting some outstanding humans. I was recently in St Arnaud, a picturesque town with a great community. While I was there I met Kyle Torney, a local artist who has single-handedly raised the bar for tourism in the region by painting nine murals of local heroes on nine buildings. One of these is on a local cafe, Six2Six, where Kyle's latest artistic installation inspires anyone who loves history and art. Kyle's work is so lifelike; it took my breath away. He brings the character of his subjects to life.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Six2Six cafe wall depicts Os Sanderson and Matt Batters, two mates who are now in their 90s. They have contributed to the heart and soul of St Arnaud through their love of farming and, for Os, planes. Matt and Os have talked about the introduction of mechanised farming in the Wimmera. These men are local heroes because they have shown how to adapt when things are looking grim. They remember when farmers in the 1940s were still using horse teams because they were cheap to feed, whereas tractors cost petrol and oil. However, the drought in 1945 caused a lot of farmers to switch—just further evidence of the historical resilience and adaptation of Mallee farmers.</span>

I extend all my best wishes to everyone for whom this is a special time. This year's Ramadan has already been very different to last year's, and I hope the same can be said of Eid—that people can gather together. I look forward, next year, I hope, to taking up the member for Watson's invitation to visit him and the community in Lakemba that he is so proud to represent.</span>

I've been thinking about all these things as I've had the opportunity to reconnect with many Muslim Australians through the holy month of Ramadan, to share iftars and to reflect and better appreciate the wonderful diversity of the Australian Muslim community and its extraordinary contribution to our multicultural society. With that in mind, I'd like to thank the Islamic Council of Victoria, Al Siraat College, the Australian Intercultural Society, the Moreland Turkish Association and the Eritrean-Djibouti community for their generosity and friendship. More importantly, I'd like to say to everyone in the Australian Muslim community, knowing, as the member for Watson reflected on, that there are very difficult times for people overseas: Eid Mubarak, my friend. Have a blessed Eid.</span>

I would especially like to thank all those who joined me in pushing back against the Premier's plan to put an unwanted, unwarranted and uncosted quarantine facility on our patch. Stay with me. We have work to do there. In my many conversations with my community one comment struck me as a laconic reflection on the last 12 months. It was: 'Out west we'd rather another pandemic than another drought'. It's a striking comment but it speaks to the impact of the pandemic on regional Australia and how well they have worked together and how used to overcoming a challenge together they are. They do so with that mix of humility, humour and hardiness that is so becoming in Australia.</span>

We should be very excited that all the great incentive programs from the last budget, that we responded to so well, continue in this budget. Through the instant asset write-offs we invested in productive assets. We grew our economy. With the tax relief we expanded our businesses and employed more people. With HomeBuilder we renovated using local contractors, and the local construction industry is booming. In the Toowoomba region we believe that growth is good. This government knows that for every dollar it invests in our patch it will get a return.</span>

It's a day commemorated as both Heroes' Day and Mullivaikkal Day, a clear reflection of a country still deeply divided. For the many Tamil refugees and asylum seekers who have found homes in Parramatta since 2009, Mullivaikkal Day is a day of great sadness and pain.

Human Rights Watch described it as 'a victory for victims of abuses' that will help them obtain information, accountability and justice. I hope this resolution will help people who are still waiting for answers and help people in my community to heal. My thoughts are with my community on this very sad day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  I recently had the opportunity to visit FORM, an innovative not-for-profit arts organisation in my electorate, with the minister for arts, the Hon. Paul Fletcher, to see how the government's Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand, or RISE, Fund has supported them. FORM received $400,000 in RISE funding, which helped them deliver the Scribblers Festival, a literature and arts festival for young people in Western Australia. The festival highlights the transformative power of storytelling through author talks, creative workshops, community engagement and art installations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an unashamed 'brickhead' and devotee of <span style="font-style:italic;">LEGO Masters</span>, I found one of the most impressive of these art installations to be <span style="font-style:italic;">RELICS: Bricks of the New World</span>, which was created by Jackson Harvey and Alex Towler. For those not in the know, they were the winners of <span style="font-style:italic;">LEGO Masters</span> series 2. <span style="font-style:italic;">RELICS</span> presents a version of earth in 2530 where humans have long since left the planet. In the relics left behind by humans, LEGO minifigurines have sprung up to create a new civilisation. These include a civilisation of mechanics working in the back of an abandoned VW and a creative civilisation living inside a piano. Honestly this is an amazing piece of work, and it engages both young and old on many levels. I would encourage everybody in my electorate, indeed in the whole of Perth, to visit the Goods Shed on Shenton Road in Claremont.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  The red and yellow striped flag has not been the official flag of Vietnam since 1975, but it is a flag which is still deeply honoured and respected in Australia. It is a flag which for many represents freedom and democracy. It's a flag which Australians fought beside. It's a flag which is incorporated in both the Australian and the United States Vietnam service medal. It's a flag recognised by many local governments, including Fairfield City, which recognises it as a heritage flag. We honour that flag when we gather at Tet and other Vietnamese celebrations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, that flag has been desecrated in acts of violence. It has been torn down. I've seen videos of it being trodden and stamped upon. This is despicable. I'm also aware that senior Vietnamese leaders have received threats because of their support for the flag of South Vietnam. We stand with the Vietnamese leaders, including Paul Nguyen. These leaders do not deserve to be dragged through to threats and intimidation. The flag is one which does represent democracy. It's one that Australians fought beside and that many Vietnamese died under. It is one that represents much that is good in terms of democracy and freedom. I'm glad the member for Blaxland is here. He represents so many Australians of Vietnamese heritage who honour that flag. Any acts of violence should be deplored. I call on the New South Wales police and, if this was done by a temporary visa holder, the Australian federal government to take this matter with due seriousness.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  Last Friday, with WA Premier Mark McGowan, I visited a site for the METRONET Forrestfield Airport Link, which is a $490 million investment from the Morrison government. Tracklaying for the Forrestfield Airport Link project is proceeding well, with almost 80 per cent completed. More than 15 kilometres of track has been laid in the tunnels and at the end of each of the lines. This project will deliver an 8.5-kilometre extension of the Perth rail network, which will connect the Midland Line near Bayswater Station to High Wycombe, via Perth Airport. Three new stations have been built in my electorate, Swan: Redcliffe, Airport Central and High Wycombe. More than 100 workers are involved in the rail infrastructure construction for the Forrestfield Airport Link, which includes tracklaying and the installation of overhead line equipment. Rail systems and signalling infrastructure within the tunnels are next at the forefront of works, including the installation of overhead conductor rail, which provides power to the trains. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once the infrastructure is completed, testing and commissioning will be conducted so drivers can become familiarised with the line. The first operational trains will run in the first half of 2022, due to some delays experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring safety has been a continual priority on the project. The Forrestfield Airport Link and METRONET more broadly play a significant role in the Morrison government's strategy of delivering congestion-busting infrastructure to Australians and in our economic recovery strategy. It is only the Morrison government that supports critical economic infrastructure investment in WA and my seat of Swan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  The loss of lives this week—currently, 32 Palestinians and three Israelis—is horrific. I condemn the attacks by both Israeli and Palestinian militants and call on them to exercise restraint. It is vital, though, to remember the context. To that end, I draw the House's attention to the commemoration this month by Palestinian Australians of Al Nakba, the anniversary of the Nakba, where, in 1948, Jewish militia razed hundreds of villages and an estimated 700,000 Palestinians were forced from their homes, becoming refugees.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Adel Yousif, an academic at the University of Tasmania, will commemorate the anniversary alongside Tasmanian Friends of Palestine. Dr Yousif's father was born in a small village in mandate Palestine. In May and July 1948, the village was attacked, resulting in members of Dr Yousif's family being killed while others fled. Dispossessed of their land and livelihood, Dr Yousif's family became stateless refugees. Dr Yousif was the first in his extended family to obtain a nationality and a passport, here in Australia. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was peculiar today to go out the front and see protesters who might be saying, 'Ban coal,' but they are actually saying, 'Make Australia weaker.' That is precisely what is going to happen if we put in place their particular view, which they are entitled to, at the expense of the liberties and freedoms of our children into the future. If we are going to deliver better than the budget the most important and precious things to the children and grandchildren who will follow us then it must be the capacity for us to stand strong in our section of the world. This budget is a clear analysis of where our power lies.</span>

Firstly, they will be confused as to why there was no announcement about a national quarantine facility. They will be very confused about that, particularly the South Asian community that I represent. There is a four-year-old Australian citizen local to my community stuck in India right now with no chance of coming home at this stage. My community were expecting that the federal government would, in this budget, finally take responsibility for quarantine facilities in this country to see us through COVID. Instead, what we saw from the government was no announcements around quarantine facilities, with not a single cent to go there, but we did see they are expecting the borders to stay closed until December. We know that the vaccine rollout is going much slower than was promised by this government, so it's not surprising that people will find all of this confusing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally confusing is that, today, the government wants to talk about the future as if the pandemic is over when in Melbourne today we know it isn't over. The Victorians in this parliament have been checking exposure sites today and yesterday. The pandemic is far from over. The federal government has failed in this budget to deliver the safety that Australians require.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  For at least nine months now, I've been calling for an industrialisation of quarantine arrangements, making it possible for Australian citizens to return home but more importantly for international students to be able to return to Australia and for the 10,000 skilled visa holders this economy needs to also gain access. But it can only be done with appropriate triage and the use of technology that is now available.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It adds insult to injury that in Sydney airport today testing is done for SARS COVID antigen results for those travelling to China, which they must have when they land, but we don't do the same testing on those who arrive in our nation. We need to do better. The technology is available. It's subject to a post-market review by the TGA and the Doherty institute, but this should not be delayed. It is unacceptable that we continue to cap at state level these arrivals. We need antigen testing predeparture. We need to explore predeparture quarantine. We then need antibody testing using lateral flow immunoassay on arrival for evidence of being immune to COVID, vaccinated or previously infected as well as antigen testing. No Australian citizen should board a flight to this country without antigen testing first to confirm that they are not infected. Otherwise, they should not fly. This can be done. It's not being done. Take the pressure off our hotels. Then you can have quarantine-lite for those who have consecutive negative antibody antigens. They can do around four days in quarantine, not 14. It would triple your turnover and throughput at the same cost.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  In 2019 the Prime Minister said his election was about every single Australian who depends on their government to put them first. The sad truth is there are clear winners and losers in this budget, and the northern end of the Central Coast has been left behind again. Eight long years since the government were first elected and they've handed down another budget which fails to deliver for the north of the Central Coast. The government are spending $1 billion across the country on local roads and not a single cent on the northern end of the Central Coast. The government must invest to clear bottlenecks like the Pacific Highway through Wyong and Bryant Drive through Tuggerah so locals can get around safely and open up investment to boost local jobs. The government announced spending on building better regions. Again, there appears to be nothing for the northern end of the Central Coast, despite a rapidly growing population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While funding for aged care is welcome, the government's announced home-care packages are over two years. It won't clear the current waiting list, while others join the end of the queue. There are currently 1,109 older people on the Central Coast waiting for care, with many waiting up to 12 to 18 months. Worse, the budget shows real wages are going backwards. That's not good news in our community when people are struggling to buy a house or pay the rent. And the budget does nothing to ease the acute shortage of GPs as books are closed and patients wait weeks for routine appointments. The Central Coast deserves proper investment from the federal government to boost local jobs, clear the infrastructure backlog and help renters and buyers as they struggle with housing affordability.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I want to acknowledge the service of Reinoud Beijerinck to the State Emergency Service unit at Hornsby. Reinoud has served as unit commander for the last five years and as a volunteer for the New South Wales SES for the last 12 years. He has decided to step back due to work and family commitments.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hornsby is one of the busier SES units in the state and Reinoud has proven his ability to manage and lead a great team, dealing with hundreds of jobs simultaneously and taking great pride in the Hornsby unit's capacity to handle a significant workload effectively. Reinoud's many achievements include coordinating the response to the 2018 Berowra hailstorm, which saw a mammoth effort from the Hornsby SES over many weeks. The remarkable response of the Hornsby SES is a testament to his leadership and his well-trained volunteers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reinoud oversaw the upgrade of the Hornsby SES unit to bring it up to standard and to enable management of large weather events. During his time as a unit commander, Reinoud has undertaken deployments to other parts of New South Wales and around the country. His commitment to serving our community extends beyond the SES—he is also a local scout leader. Reinoud will continue his service as chainsaw and incident management trainer within the New South Wales SES, as well as being an active field volunteer to support our local members and our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank Reinoud for his exemplary service to our community and for his ongoing dedication to equipping volunteers and leaders in our community with the skills they need to respond in a time of crisis. I remember during the Berowra hailstorm, which his own house had been affected by, Reinoud put himself last and his community first. That's the sort of service he has given our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  The Prime Minister had two jobs this year: the vaccine rollout and national quarantine. He has completely and utterly failed at both, and now the one thing that we thought was certain in this current world of uncertainty—the value of Australian citizenship—has been completely nullified. This government is leaving behind vulnerable Australians who are still stuck overseas. It is completely un-Australian to threaten to jail our fellow citizens who simply want to get home safely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are stranded in India: that's a fact. An Australian resident lost his life in the COVID riddled country last week. We should be doing everything we can to get Australians home, to get them the help they need. Citizenship comes with rights and responsibilities, but what even is citizenship if you can be jailed just for coming home? The Morrison government's ban on our own citizens must be seen for what it is: an admission of failure. It's a failure to stand up and fulfil the federal government's constitutional responsibility to run a fit-for-purpose quarantine process nationally. Of course the government must act on health advice and, as long as it is fundamentally failing on quarantine and vaccination, health experts have no choice but to provide such harsh guidance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, hey, the Prime Minister still thinks that we're at the front of the queue when it comes to vaccination. It is clear that the Morrison government is not on the side of Australians.</span>

Last week I had the privilege of meeting with locals Brian Burdett and Peter Collins, both of whom served in our armed forces. Brian served aboard HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Quickmatch</span> from 1954 to 1961 as part of the Royal Australian Navy. He did two tours with the Far East Strategic Reserve, notably supporting the efforts to contain the communist uprising in Malaya. Peter also served in our Navy from 1992 to 2007, operating across regions, including Iraq and Somalia. He received the Australian Operational Service Medal in recognition of his deployment in border protection operations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both Peter and Brian also happen to be stalwarts of the mighty Box Hill Rugby Union Football Club. It was a privilege to honour these incredible men with a certificate of appreciation, acknowledging their exceptional service to this nation and their continuing service to our community and its people. Congratulations, Brian and Peter, and thank you. I look forward to catching up with both of you again. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Well, you wouldn't want to be a tourism operator in the Blue Mountains or a travel agent in the Hawkesbury holding out for some extra support from this week's budget, because it wasn't there. There was nothing to support major attractions like Scenic World, who have to keep equipment maintained and safe until overseas visitors return. Nor was there support for travel agents, who are now being told that it will be another year before they can expect their customers to be able to go overseas, thanks to a broken promise of a quick vaccination program and a failed quarantine scheme. The businesses and workers in my community have survived fire and flood—twice—and pandemic, with small businesses hanging on by the skin of their teeth. Those are their words, not mine. And don't tell me that bushfire recovery money is there, because so little of it hit the ground in the last year that I can count on two fingers the number of businesses that'll be able to expand their tourism offerings as a result of that so-called local economic support.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Hawkesbury region—the region that has had its new much-touted flood-free bridge go under—there's no indication of additional money to do a decent job on the North Richmond duplication project for that bridge, or for improved evacuation routes to take people east to safety. And where is our Hawkesbury headspace? It didn't happen as a result of the last budget and it has not been announced in this one either. It's not going too far to say that lives have been lost because of the failure of this government to deliver decent mental health services to this community.</span>

I'd first like to acknowledge retiring member Ivan Dean, who has dedicated much of his life to public service in our community, first as policeman and then as Launceston mayor, before being elected to the Legislative Council 18 years ago. I know firsthand, as a former mayor, how dedicated Ivan was to our community and I'd like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude for his tireless commitment to the people of Windermere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This theme of community service rolled into the election that we've just seen, with five dedicated candidates raising their hands. Putting yourself forward for public office is not an easy decision, so I say well done for a thoughtful and respectful campaign to former federal member for Bass Geoff Lyons; policeman and youth advocate Will Smith; Councillor Rob Soward; and Vivienne Gale. Together with successful candidate Nick Duigan, they highlighted what a healthy democracy is all about. I take this opportunity to congratulate Nick, whom I got to know well through the campaign. Nick is known in Tasmania as the host of a fishing show but, along with the voters of Windermere, I saw his love and dedication to the community. His background as a small business owner and ambassador for community organisations will serve him well in his new role, working in the interests of the diverse Windermere community. Congratulations, Nick. I know you will do the community proud.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  One thing is clear from the government's budget: they've never spoken to a worker in their lives. I spent this morning with aged-care workers and nurses and—do you know what?—they feel so let down. The Liberals' aged-care response falls way short of the most crucial issue of aged care, and that is the workforce. The Prime Minister refused to accept the royal commission recommendations that require a registered nurse on every shift, 24/7. They work with carers who are looking after very frail people with multiple serious life-threatening conditions and they help others approach the end of life pain free and with dignity. For the workers themselves, there wasn't even a half-hearted attempt to fix the wages and conditions of carers and nurses in the sector. They've kicked the can down the road on an increase in minutes of care—that is, how much time they actually get to spend with their residents—and there's to be no increase in those minutes of care for two years. They've failed to implement a workforce plan, and so many other recommendations are not going to be taken up by the government in this budget. There's a half-hearted attempt to require auditing and public disclosure of taxpayers' money, with $10 extra per resident being given to providers but no hard requirements that that money be spent on food, extra care or even the staffing that is so desperately needed right now. They have let aged-care workers down.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  First, I want to welcome Graham and Julie Watson and Eddie and Barbara Curie from the Goldstein electorate, who are in the chamber today. Secondly, I want to congratulate the Treasurer on measures in his third budget. Home ownership provides the foundation for the economic security of individuals and families. It's also how we democratise the ownership and wealth distribution of the nation. This budget includes measures that put life decisions in their proper order—home first, super second. There is more to do, but it's a great start. The Liberal Party has always understood the importance of home ownership. Sadly, the same cannot be said of members on the other side, who want Australians to be serfs to their own super. The rumours are right, the opposition leader wants an indentured nation not empowered citizens. </span>

The Prime Minister has repeatedly announced that wages will go up, but page 37 of Budget Paper No. 1 confirms that real wages will be cut. How is it possible that after eight long years of this government the Prime Minister can rack up a trillion dollars of Liberal debt and Australians get their real wages cut?</span>

First and foremost, that means getting Australians back into work and getting Australians back into jobs. I'll hand over to the Treasurer in just one moment to address the specific issue that the Leader of the Opposition has raised. As we know, over the course of the current financial year and through the pandemic period many initiatives were undertaken by the government which have had an impact on how the inflation rate has been impacted as a result of those measures—whether it was through child care—and that has provided timing differences in relation to how these matters are measured technically.</span>

The Leader of the Opposition did raise, I think, a legitimate point of order. The Prime Minister was certainly in order up until the fact he broadened out into a number of other issues. He needs to relate his material obviously to the question. Also, to the Leader of the House, in terms of the point of order, I am not sure that he necessarily heard all of the question when it was asked. The Treasurer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:03</span>):  Real wages obviously take inflation into account. We have seen modest inflation, so real wages are at their 10-year average. The Leader of the Opposition specifically refers to the fact that we will see mid this year, according to the budget papers, inflation at around 3½ per cent. That is because we saw inflation go negative in the year prior, for the first time in 60 years, as we put in place emergency measures like free child care. What the Leader of the Opposition fails to acknowledge is that the best way to drive up wages, real or nominal, is to blow up the unemployment rate. It is under this government, this coalition, that the unemployment rate today is lower than when we came to government. At 5.6 per cent, the unemployment rate is lower than when we came to government, even after the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In last night's budget we indicated that we are seeking to drive the unemployment rate down even further, from 5.6 per cent down to 5.1 per cent—before the pandemic hit—and even lower. As the RBA and Treasury have said, in order to drive an acceleration in wages you need to have an unemployment rate with a four in front of it. In last night's budget papers, Treasury printed a forecast for the unemployment rate to go under five by the end of next year. Our policies are for more investment in skills, more investment in infrastructure and more investment through tax relief while helping to drive more Australians into jobs. That is our record and that is what we will defend every day of the week.</span>

She will know—like I think many in this House, particularly the government members—that last night, as the Treasurer handed down the budget, the response from so many was to welcome so many of those measures. But, most importantly, I note the comments by Chris Richardson, the esteemed economist, who said: 'It is absolutely the right budget for the times. The fight against COVID has become the fight against unemployment.' He is right, and that is exactly what this budget is designed to do as we secure the Australian recovery and we take up that fight against unemployment through the measures that were handed down in this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, importantly, what this recognises is that we understand the times that we are in right now. Those times are that we have a global pandemic that is not better but worse than it was a year ago—a global pandemic that has raged through the developed world and is now raging through the developing world as we speak. It also comes at a time when we know that the economic impact on the global economy means that this pandemic recession is 30 times worse than what we saw in the global financial crisis. So it is a significant and very difficult time in which we are putting together this recovery plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our actions as a government over the course of the past 18 months have backed Australians in through the course of this pandemic to support the decisions that they are making to get them, their families, their businesses and their employees through what has been such a difficult time, and to manage the health impacts. If Australia had had the average mortality rate of the OECD nations, there would have been 30,000 more fatalities as a result of COVID in this country over the course of this pandemic to this time. In addition, there are more people employed today than before the pandemic began.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has made great advances in this fight against unemployment and the fight against the COVID-19 virus, but we cannot put those gains at risk. That is why securing Australia's recovery is what this budget is all about. It is a plan to secure that recovery, which will ensure that the gains that have been hard won will not be lost but embedded—the jobs that have been taken back, those million Australians finding their way back into the workforce and the employers who have made it possible and the bravery of those Australians getting that job done. That's what this budget is about: a plan for securing Australia's recovery.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the key to driving higher wages is a tighter labour market with more people in work. This is an inconvenient truth for the member for Rankin, who always seeks to make politics in this chamber rather than acknowledging the national interest. But half a million jobs have been created since the last budget. In the MYEFO in December last year, Treasury were forecasting an unemployment rate of 7½ per cent in the March quarter, and today it is 5.6 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We announced in last night's budget significant measures to invest more in infrastructure, more in skills, tax relief for families, business investment incentives and childcare reforms to drive greater workforce participation. They are all designed to make our economy stronger. The measures of the Morrison government have been targeted and designed to get more people in work. We knew that we had to transition in last night's budget off emergency support measures like JobKeeper. You know that the member for Rankin was begging us to continue spending more than $2 billion per month on JobKeeper, but we held firm. The good news for the House is that, since JobKeeper ended, around 120,000 Australians have come off income support, which is a direct pointer to the resilience and the strength of the labour market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Rankin described what Australia went through last year as the deepest, most damaging recession for almost 100 years. The fact that Australia is now recovering strongly, ahead of the global pack, is something that we can all know that the Australian people have helped achieve. It's not the result of luck, because Australians make their own luck.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:12</span>):  I thank the member for Fisher, who in a previous life was an apprentice carpenter and is somebody who understands the importance of apprenticeships. That's something that was backed in last night's budget. But, importantly for the member for Fisher, more than 63,000 taxpayers in his electorate got a tax cut last night and more than 7,000 businesses in his electorate will be able to access business tax incentives as a result of measures in last night's budget.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the height of this pandemic, Australia was staring into the economic abyss. Treasury feared that unemployment could reach as high as 15 per cent and that GDP growth could fall by more than 20 per cent. The Morrison government responded with an unprecedented amount of economic support—now $291 billion—with programs like JobKeeper, which helped support 3.8 million Australians in a job; JobSeeker, which helped support 1½ million Australians who were out of work; and the cash flow boost, which supported 800,000 businesses and not-for-profits. As a result of those measures we have seen Australia become the first of the major advanced economies to have employment rise above the prepandemic levels with, today, 75,000 more Australians in work since the beginning of the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In last night's budget, we announced further investment in skills, with $2.7 billion for more apprenticeships. We announced more money for the JobTrainer program so we can support 450,000 training places. We supported new measures to incentivise employers to take on the long-term unemployed. There's investment in foundational skills: maths, English and computer literacy. We announced in last night's budget $15 billion of new infrastructure spending to keep our 10-year pipeline going. And, of course, in last night's budget we announced significant tax relief which will support more than 10 million Australians, low- and middle-income earners, get up to $1,080 in their pocket as a result of measures supported on this side of the House. This side of the House believes in lower taxes, this side of the House believes in a stronger economy and this side of the House believes in creating more jobs. That's what last night's budget will deliver.</span>

I refer the member to the Treasurer's response to this matter when it was raised earlier. We came off a year last year where inflation was negative, and we've moved into a year where we've seen prices adjust in the following year, so it's not surprising, if those opposite think that inflation is going to be running at over three per cent, then they would be expecting interest rates to rise as well. We all know from the Governor of the Reserve Bank that that is not what he has got planned in his public statements.</span>

Prime Minister, yesterday's federal budget listed 10 city and regional deals, including—surprise, surprise!—the Launceston City Deal for the marginal electorate of Bass. But there was no mention of the Hobart City Deal, which was announced with much fanfare two years ago and which has seen little action beyond the $30 million social housing package I negotiated. Prime Minister: remember the Hobart deal promised the Antarctic precinct at Macquarie Point, activation of the rail corridor and to address Hobart's terrible traffic congestion and housing crisis. So when is the government going to deliver these vital initiatives for Tasmania's capital? Or don't they pass the pork-barrelling test? No wonder the public detests politics and politicians.</span>

But I thank the member for Clark for his question. I was in Hobart with the former Tasmanian Premier, Will Hodgman, in February 2019 when we announced that deal, with around $1.7 billion in investment. We also expect that deal to create over 1,400 jobs. Before I hand over to the minister responsible, let me update the member on a couple of things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Design work on the replacement of the Bridgewater Bridge is continuing. We expect the Commonwealth investment in this project will be some $461 million, and we anticipate works will begin on that next year. Direct flights from Hobart to Auckland recommenced on 21 April 2021 for the first time since 1996, and Air New Zealand is now flying the service twice a week into Hobart. Forty-eight properties have already been tenanted through the $30 million investment to deliver at least 100 new dwellings in the Greater Hobart region, in partnership with community housing providers. I know that's a topic the member is keenly interested in and played a key role in when we formed this deal. And city deal partners are considering the findings of a study of potential transport solutions to the northern suburbs transport corridor, which will help to identify the most economic and efficient option. I'll ask the minister to add further to the answer.</span>

Certainly, the Morrison government is very focused on the Hobart City Deal. As the Prime Minister mentioned, one of the elements of the city deal is the $82.3 million commitment for the provision of border services to allow international flights to come into Hobart Airport. So I was very pleased to be able to represent the Morrison government on 22 April this year at the Hobart Airport to welcome the first international flight coming in from Auckland—in other words, a key element of the city deal being delivered. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another element of the city deal—as the member rightly refers to and, indeed, had some important involvement in—is the $30 million commitment to affordable housing. I was pleased to have the chance to visit a group of houses which had been built under the program recently. I visited Kathleen Moore, who resides in one of those homes. She thanked the government for her new home and made the point that her rent was previously 80 per cent of her pension and that, now, thanks to these new housing arrangements, it's 25 per cent of her pension.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister has rightly said, work is well advanced on Bridgewater Bridge, a major component of the Hobart City Deal. In relation to the Antarctic and Science Precinct at Macquarie Point, a detailed business case is presently being developed and there's been very extensive engagement with stakeholders. I've been pleased to have discussions with the state minister, the relevant council mayors and other stakeholders on this project. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Last night we announced in the budget an additional $1 billion for the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program. For the member for Cowper, for the five councils that he either has wholly and solely in his fine Mid North Coast electorate or indeed shares with the tremendous members for Page and Lyne, we see considerable uplift in the amount of money that they are going to get to spend on local roads and community infrastructure: Bellingen Shire gets an additional $1.1 million; Coffs Harbour City Council, finely represented by the mayor there, Denise Knight, $2.7 million; Kempsey Shire—and we were there recently at the community hub, a project which is going to make such a difference for the social outcomes of that great place—$2.3 million; Nambucca Valley, $1.5 million; and Port Macquarie-Hastings Council—and we caught up with Peta Pinson as well—$3.6 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night's announcement was for the 537 councils across Australia but, for those in Cowper, there was $11.4 million. That takes the total for those five councils to $26.9 million. That's a significant investment in not only their shires but also infrastructure right throughout Cowper. For example, the Coffs Harbour bypass is changing the landscape of the member's electorate. It's taking 12,000 vehicles out of the town centre each day. That is so significant. The Commonwealth has allocated $1.46 billion for the 14-kilometre bypass of Coffs. There are currently 53 active contracts on the project. What they are all doing is creating jobs, creating opportunities and creating investment, making procurement for those small businesses around Coffs Harbour. Of the 12,000 jobs across the life of this project, 2,000 are going to be in Coffs Harbour. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the infrastructure budget announced by the Treasurer last night has $15.2 billion of new project commitments. But don't just take my word for it. Chris Melham—I know he's known to many of those opposite—CEO of the Civil Contractors Federation, said, 'Investing in civil infrastructure projects generates jobs, boosts business confidence and underpins economic growth.' That is what he said, and he is right. Certainly regional Australia is a big beneficiary of the infrastructure budget announced last night, including the 10-year Infrastructure Investment Pipeline Program and the 30,000 additional jobs on top of the 100,000. This $110 billion of infrastructure is supporting Australians right throughout the economy—and certainly, as I say again, in those country areas. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I notice the ALP have a little logo that they're now putting on their media releases. It's got a three-word slogan, would you believe; it's all about spin. The three-word slogan we need is this one: 'securing Australia's recovery'. That's what the budget does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I read the media release closely. There is no underspend. There is no cut. The budget makes for an infrastructure rollout of $110 billion right across the economy. There were 30,000 additional jobs announced last night. As I explained to the member for Ballarat yesterday, what we do is pay on delivery. We pay on milestones. It might be the Labor way to pay for a job that isn't yet completed—they might have done that in those six sorry, dysfunctional, chaotic years—but we pay on delivery. We're getting on with the job. You heard from the Treasurer last night the new commitments we've made, the $15.2 billion of commitments we are making, right across every state and every territory.</span>

                  </a>  Indeed, those state and territory Labor ministers, who I advised on Sunday night in a courtesy call about the infrastructure rollout—which, yes, the member for Ballarat says was on the front pages of the paper; good on the press gallery for acknowledging what a great budget it is and what an infrastructure budget it is—are also very much in favour of the infrastructure rollout we've got. Those Labor ministers, whether it was Mark Bailey in Queensland, whether it was Jacinta Allan in Victoria, whether it was Rita Saffioti or Eva Lawler, all acknowledged the projects we are building in their states or territories. Chris Steel, from the ACT, was indeed another to say, 'Thank you, well done.' That's what we are doing; we are getting on with the job of building the infrastructure Australia needs. There is no cut. The only cut I've seen this week is the haircut I got the other day!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small business is taking advantage of all the tax incentives we are giving them. We are getting on with the job of putting in place the infrastructure Australia needs. And did I mention it before—30,000 jobs were announced in the infrastructure rollout last night. Already, our $110 billion is supporting 100,000 jobs. You could have only dreamt, Opposition Leader, of that money when you were the infrastructure minister, yet you didn't get that sort of money. You didn't have that sort of delivery. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Northern Territory is a vital part of the infrastructure component of the budget. I speak to members in the Northern Territory all the time, whether it's Lia Finnochiaro, the leader of the CLP in that great territory, or indeed Michael Gunner or Eva Lawler. I speak to them and I acknowledge the role that they play in wanting to build, needing to build, demanding to build, expecting to build and deserving to have the infrastructure that we are rolling out right across the nation. But, as I told the member for Ballarat in answer to her question, there is no cut to infrastructure spending. We are getting on with delivery, whether it's in the Northern Territory or anywhere else across this land.</span>

                  </a>  There's $150 million for phase 2 of the Northern Territory national network highway upgrades and $173.6 million towards the sixth corridor of the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative. That supports the development of the gas industry in the Beetaloo sub-basin and, indeed, $0.3 million for a development study of the proposed Tennant Creek multimodal facility and rail terminal, which I visited not that long ago. When, you might ask? We are getting on with the job. We will work with the Northern Territory government, because that's what we do. They give us their priorities. We invest in them. We do it on an 80-20 basis when it comes to regional areas, unlike Labor, where it's only 50-50. That's why—let me tell you—territory and state governments love it when the Liberals and Nationals are in government. It's because they get more value for their infrastructure dollar.</span>

Economic security goes hand in hand with financial independence, and this is a budget that gives women more choices than they have ever had before in the workforce. Within our $3.4 billion women's budget we have $1.9 billion to support women's economic security—to retrain for a new job, to acquire new skills, to take on an apprenticeship or, as an employer, to take on an apprentice or to take stock mid-career and take a different direction. All of these opportunities and choices are funded through this budget. We can make this possible when we give women a secure future. The childcare investment alone will add up to 300,000 hours of work a week, allowing mothers, fathers and carers, up to 40,000 people, to work an extra day a week, boosting GDP by $1.5 billion a year.</span>

This budget delivers the funding to implement our response to <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span>. We know that many women, particularly those in the later stages of their lives, can find themselves suddenly financially vulnerable.

                  </a>  We'll remove the $450 superannuation guarantee per month threshold to improve those superannuation balances. We've got the family home guarantee to help single-parent families into home ownership. We're undertaking all of these measures not just for the benefit of Australian women and to help them achieve personal economic security but to improve the economic security of Australia as a whole, particularly in rural and regional Australia, where it is great to see women leading the way as families move from city to country with more opportunities and more choices.</span>

That is not a policy statement nor is it a policy commitment of the government. It is a Treasury assumption that has been put in place, and it makes no reference to second doses; it only refers to doses. We expect the vaccination program that the government is rolling out in partnership with the states and territories to achieve some three million doses by the end of this week. The numbers in just yesterday show that states and territories, together with GPs around the country, are making strong progress each and every day, and more and more Australians are getting their vaccinations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">From next Monday, those aged over 50 will be able to go to their GP and receive their AstraZeneca vaccine. I encourage them to do that. Where we stand right now is that just over 10 per cent of the eligible adult population have received their first dose. Over 30 per cent, around a third, of those aged over 70 and about 80 per cent of aged-care facilities have had the first dose. The vaccination program will continue to roll out in coordination with the plan that we have agreed with the national cabinet members in partnership with the states and territories. We will be moving as quickly as possible based on the supply of vaccines. I commend the minister for health that we continue to access additional supplies of vaccines, particularly the Pfizer vaccine, and bring them forward as much as we can to ensure that those vaccines can be provided to the over-50 population.</span>

I note that this week data has come out showing that the strongest gains in online job ads are from the honourable member's state of South Australia, with a staggering increase of 61.3 per cent pre-COVID. Indeed, the vacancy report from the National Skills Commission shows that job advertisements seasonally adjusted are up 3.3 per cent month on month, standing at 243,500 jobs right now for Australians to take. It is the 12th consecutive month of an increase in job advertisements, which are now 245 per cent above the level recorded in April 2020. It is an extraordinary result as the economy kicks back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister has said, if you have a go, you will get a go, and right now Australians are certainly having a crack. The unemployment rate is at 5.6 per cent and 13.1 million Australians are in work today, over 100,000 more than pre-COVID. As the Prime Minister has said, Australia is the only country in the OECD to achieve this result—and I can see those opposite are applauding the government for that! The budget is driving Australia's economic recovery through more jobs and more skills, and there has never been a better time for Australians to get skills. Indeed, there are 1.16 million Australians on JobSeeker or youth allowance 'other', 120,000 fewer than one month ago. Ten per cent of people went off the payment in one month—extraordinary. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a great opportunity now for Australians to get skilled. The budget has a billion-dollar JobTrainer Fund continuance to deliver low-fee or fee-free training places in areas of skill needs. This will ensure that Australians can get access to critical skills—10,000 places in digital skills and 33,800 places in the aged-care sector for critical skills. We are also investing $1.5 billion to support the employment of newly commenced apprentices and trainees, assisting school levers and jobseekers, especially during the peak hiring period for key industries. This will see the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy extend for a further six months, through to March 2022, to pick up all the school leavers who will be finishing school at the end of this year. Furthermore, the Morrison government will deliver the single biggest transformation of the employment services model that we have seen in over two decades. The New Employment Services Model will modernise exactly how government has connections with jobseekers and how they connect with employers, placing jobseekers in the centre of their journey to getting a job, with a very strong digital focus. This budget is 100 per cent focused on skilling and getting Australians into jobs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know it's been a long time since they have been in an expenditure review committee and they don't have the skills or the experience to understand how budgets are put together. They didn't do a particularly good job of it when they were last in government. So it may be a mystery to them. Perhaps we should offer them courses in how budgets are put together. Perhaps that could be one of the many courses. There are a lot of training courses that we are providing. Maybe we should introduce a training course to the Labor Party on how to prepare a budget and how to engage in responsible expenditure to secure Australia's future. Perhaps we should put training programs to the Labor Party on how to develop economic policies to support the Australian people. But I will allow the Minister for Health and Aged Care to add further to the answer.</span>

What we are seeing is those numbers increasing. Over the course of the year, we expect to have 40 million Pfizer vaccines in Australia. All of these things are, of course, dependent—as Treasury note—on the ability of these vaccines to arrive in the country. Our expectation is that those vaccines will be available, that that supply will be available. We are seeing this week a million CSL vaccines being made available. Some have to be provisioned for contingency, for second doses, but we are distributing approximately 900,000 doses this week.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are ensuring that, over the course of the year, we do have supply for all Australians to have the opportunity to be vaccinated. What that does is give us greater security and greater protection as a nation. The most fundamental of all assumptions within the budget with regard to COVID is that Australia continues to be safe. Of all of the elements, that is the one with the most significant importance. We are now, on the advice I have today, at 83 days with zero cases of community transmission. So that assumption looks as if it is going to be a very strong assumption. What we see from that and what we see in relation to the capacity to supply enough vaccines for every Australian who chooses to have that opportunity over the course of the year is that they remain strong and clear.</span>

This budget invests in essential services on a variety of fronts within the health space. We see a $6 billion investment in Medicare over and above that which was there—an increase. We go from $30 billion to $31 billion to $32 billion to $33 billion per annum over the course of the budget. In aged care a $17.7 billion increase will take aged care from $26 billion to $29 billion to $31 billion to $33 billion, almost as much as Medicare, over the course of the final year of the forward estimates.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But one of the most important investments is in mental health. Every single person in this chamber is interested in mental health, as a member for parliament but also as a mother or a father, as a son or a daughter, as a friend or as somebody within their community. We all know the challenges and the ravages of mental health. We saw predictions of catastrophic outcomes in terms of suicide last year. From the latest advice I have, thankfully we have been spared that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's still so much more to do on suicide prevention. In mental health, we're investing $2.3 billion. To sit around the budget cabinet table with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, for whom this was an equal passion, was a great privilege, and to see that we've been able to invest in the National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan, which is transformative, is extraordinarily important. It will have five pillars. It will see $250 million going to prevention and early intervention for resilience for all Australians, but particularly young Australians; $350 million going to suicide prevention; $1.4 billion into treatment, for a new national network of treatment centres for adults, for youth and for children, and the Head to Health program, which will stand alongside the headspace program; $100 million for vulnerable Australians, with a particular focus on our Indigenous communities; and $200 million for workforce and governance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in particular, with regard to suicide prevention, the Prime Minister said to me and to Christine Morgan, 'What's the single thing that will save the most lives?' and Christine Morgan said, as a result of her work, 'Universal aftercare.' That means, for every person who has attempted suicide and has been discharged, having the capacity to have a program that will follow them. There is $158 million for a universal aftercare program. It's something that has been summarised very simply by Suicide Prevention Australia. The head of Suicide Prevention Australia, Nieves Murray, said 'the additional investment in services to support people who have survived a suicide attempt will save lives'. There couldn't be a more important investment.</span>

                  </a>  The assumption is for a whole-of-population vaccination program, and the difference between a first and second shot of the Pfizer vaccine, which is what we're doing in the final quarter, is three weeks. So, if you have the whole population in the course of the year—and this is very simple to understand—those people who complete their vaccination by 9 December will be done this year; and, if there are those that occur in the last few days of the year, then, by definition, those three weeks will be on the other side of the calendar. But what does that mean? It means that our goal is to ensure that the whole population has the opportunity, through supply, to access a vaccine this year. If there are some who choose, because of personal circumstances, to have it in the last couple of weeks of the year and that then means that they go into the first week of next year, that does not affect any of the assumptions. So the answer is very simple. The difference between the two is only the difference of the three weeks. For the opposition to think that that is material or germane is deceptive and inaccurate. </span>

Family, domestic and sexual violence in all the pernicious forms that it takes must stop, whether it be the sickening and, sadly, too frequent incidence of intimate partner violence or the emerging challenges of online abuse, harassment and stalking. Everyone has the right to safety in their homes, in their workplaces, in their places of study, in the community and online—everyone. I would like to acknowledge the many women and children who have spoken out about their own intensely personal and harrowing stories, often at their own cost. They are brave, and their leadership helps change the future for other women. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Within our $3.4 billion women's budget, we are committing $1.1 billion to women's safety, the largest single Commonwealth investment in women's safety in a federal budget—funding for prevention and frontline services, and perpetrator interventions; and research so we can build our evidence base, and for emerging issues, such as how technology is being increasingly used for coercive control. This budget represents the Commonwealth's down payment on the next Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children, which will commence in mid-2022. So there is further investment to follow, after the consultations which we will have with the states, including the national women's safety summit to be held on 29 and 30 July. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among the comprehensive range of measures that the government is now committing to are: a new national partnership agreement with states and territories to bolster frontline family support to combat domestic and sexual violence; immediate financial assistance to women leaving violent relationships, delivering up to $5,000 to help establish a home away from violence; and more funds to the states and territories for legal services. Our most vulnerable women, many in rural and regional Australia, where I come from, who have been victims of violence will now be able to get help from a local community legal centre—a door that previously had not been open to everyone. The women who work in those centres understand the needs of those who walk through that door. The government is steadfast in its commitment to improve services and outcomes for women and children, and I know that I'm joined by all members of this place who stand by that resolution.</span>

Our job is to fight the virus, and in this budget what you see are further commitments, including to the vaccination program, the securing of vaccines and ensuring that the vaccination program is rolling out. You'll also notice in those budget papers that the biggest threat in the short term, particularly while the virus is still raging around the world, relates to ensuring that we keep our internal borders open in this country, and it is noted in the assumptions of Treasury in these budget papers that we need to keep the broader international borders shut to ensure that we can protect Australia from the COVID-19 pandemic that is raging around the world. I would have thought that in this place, as we are seeking to vaccinate the country, there would have been bipartisan support for that initiative. If those opposite can't bring themselves to join a united national effort on this vaccine, then I will let the Australian people judge them for that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that vaccination program, as we speak today, our rate of vaccinations at this time—compared with comparative countries that are in a situation just like Australia, where we've had low rates of cases—is higher than that of New Zealand, higher than that of South Korea, higher than that of Canada and higher than that of Japan. Those opposite, in the middle of a pandemic, seek to undermine and play politics with the health of this nation. The Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party may be desperate. They may have no answers. They may have no plan. They may have no clue. But I can guarantee the Leader of the Opposition this: he may wish to fight me, but I'm fighting this virus on behalf of the Australian people.</span>

I know he represents some wonderful manufacturing industries in his electorate. Indeed, if you look at the manufacturing industries in Australia, they were hit very hard and faced enormous challenges during the height of the COVID lockdowns. But one of the remarkable things, and under the stewardship of this government, is that those manufacturing industries were incredibly resilient and adaptable. Those manufacturing industries now demonstrate that employment in the manufacturing sector in Australia is almost at pre-COVID levels and is on the rise, which is a remarkable result after the challenges they faced. That also relates to the Australian government's Modern Manufacturing Strategy. That strategy, based on similar programs, is estimated to have the capacity to increase direct manufacturing jobs over the next decade by another 80,000 jobs, which, again, will build on the great work that has seen the manufacturing sector growing and thriving in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night's budget implemented the Morrison government's plan for manufacturing even further. It will create more jobs and secure Australia's world-leading recovery from the COVID pandemic by combining science, technology and manufacturing. In last night's budget, $387 million was dedicated to the Square Kilometre Array telescope in Western Australia. That will see Australia host the larger part of what will be the world's largest and most powerful radio telescope, which will be on the cutting-edge of scientific discovery. It will also create hundreds of local jobs in my home state of Western Australia. Last night's budget also included $116 million for the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. That builds on the $238 million in last year's budget to maintain our vital sovereign nuclear medicine manufacturing capability. Having recently visited that facility, I know that, over our lives, two in every three Australians will benefit from the medicines that are manufactured at that great facility. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this builds on last year's budget, which allocated $1.5 billion to the Australian government's Modern Manufacturing Strategy, and all of this together has shown a remarkable result. Even after all of the challenges that the manufacturing sector has faced through COVID and during the height of the COVID lockdowns, the Ai Group's Australian Performance of Manufacturing Index shows that this is now a flourishing sector in Australia. They looked at six of the main manufacturing sectors and found that, in April, all of them were expanding. Each of those six sectors was expanding. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were further developments in last night's budget, including a new patent box for the medical and biotech sectors, where income earned from new patents will be taxed at the concessional rate of 17 per cent, all contributing to the sector's great growth.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management and Deputy Leader of the National Party</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:08</span>):  I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He, as a former farmer, would know more than anyone the importance of biosecurity not just to our nation's security but also to the nearly 339,000 Australians who are employed in agriculture. That's why, in supporting agriculture's ambitious goal of $100 billion by 2030, we devised our Ag2030 plan. One of the key pillars to that is biosecurity, and making sure we are backing it with cash. Last night, I'm proud to say, this government invested a further $400 million, on top of the $888 million that we committed in the budget in October, to making sure we protect those borders. Part of that, nearly $30 million, is for the eradication of pests—that is, making sure that we remove deer, pigs and dogs from the landscape to protect our biosecurity and also our environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this, we're also looking to modernise our biosecurity systems so that they evolve as the threats evolve. That's not just putting boots on the ground and paws on the ground; it's also making sure we are investing in technology, putting in new scientists, increasing the number of scientists, so that we can have real-time decision-making processes where we understand the threats as they appear and making sure that we have the ability to eradicate them as quickly as we possibly can. But technology is the way forward. That's why we've invested in 3D X-ray machines that we put into our postal services. There are 144 million parcels that go through Australia Post every year, and now, with artificial intelligence and 3D X-rays, we'll be able to detect any organic matter or plant life. In fact, we will be evolving this technology to be able to detect any animal life within these parcels so that our officers can intercept and protect through the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also working with international partners to adopt this technology so that before someone leaves a country we will know what's in their bag, if it is an organic matter, if it has plant life, so that we can deploy the resources on the spot to make sure that we can protect Australia. An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease would cost us around $50 billion—just that alone—so it's important we continue to protect our biosecurity borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're complementing that with increased penalties. I'm proud to say that since we introduced new penalties in October 2019 we have cancelled the visas of 14 overseas visitors who failed to declare on their declaration cards, such was the seriousness of the infringement. We also lifted the on-spot fines from $444 to $2,664 and, to importers, lifting it from $400,000 to a million dollars plus paying a penalty of 10 years jail. This is about protecting Australia's borders, but it's also, more importantly, about protecting the jobs of Australian agriculture.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="37998" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  I think it's important, when we consider the budget that was handed down by the Treasurer from that dispatch box last night, to think about whether or not there are areas of common ground, areas where we can find agreement with the government, things that the government has said in the 24 hours or so since the budget was handed down that we agree with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I noticed at lunchtime today, when the Treasurer was giving his speech to the National Press Club, he said something that I agreed with 100 per cent. He said that the budget that was handed down last night was a very liberal budget. It was a very liberal budget, I think, in one incredibly important respect. Only the Liberal Party of Morrison and Frydenberg could find a way to spend $100 billion in one night, rack up a trillion dollars in debt and still have the working people of this country go backwards. Only the Liberal Party of Morrison and Frydenberg could find a way to say to the workers of this country, 'We are going to spray all kinds of money around for political purposes to get us through an election. We are going to spray money around at all the problems that have piled up over the past eight long years of this government. But we're going to find a way to make sure that the thanks you get for the sacrifices you made during this pandemic is a cut in real wages.' That is a defining failure and a defining feature of the budget that was handed down last night. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an admission of failure that, despite all of that money being spent, all of that money being borrowed, all of those commitments being made and all of those announcements that were made from the dispatch box over there, at the end of that, Australians have to look forward to one thing: a cut in their real wages. This would be bad enough if it were an isolated failure, but what we on this side of the House as the representatives of Australian working people know is that stagnant wages growth has been with us for much of the eight long years that those opposite have been government and that this wasn't the first budget that they handed down from over there; it was the eighth budget that they handed down. It is worth a trip down memory lane to remember that the failure at the core of this 2021 budget is not an isolated failure; it is a pattern of behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got all the budgets here. The 2014 budget was all about repairing the budget before they went on to hand down the biggest deficits in history and more debt than any government has ever handed down. The budget the year after that, 2015, was about a fairer pension system; at its core were cuts to the pension. In 2016 the budget was all about jobs and growth, just before we went into a cycle of anaemic growth and high underemployment. The 2017 budget was a budget for better days ahead, not that far ahead of the Morrison recession. The 2018 budget—on track to deliver budget surpluses and living within our means! The 2019 budget delivers a surplus! This was the budget with all of the 'back in black' mugs that they flogged from the Liberal Party website. The centrepiece of the 2020 budget was the JobMaker program that promised 450,000 jobs and delivered just over 1,000 jobs. It's like if your mate owed you $450 and gave you $1—you wouldn't be happy with that! That was the defining feature of the last budget, and then we get to last night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night was all of the spin and all of the marketing, but at the very core of this budget, as colleagues have mentioned today, was that cut in real wages. This isn't just one year of failure; this is eight years of getting the budget wrong. The next budget that those opposite land will be the first one that they land. That's one of the many reasons why the credibility of those opposite on the economy is completely shredded. We should put these eight budgets into the dumpster fire of inconsistency, economic mismanagement and humiliating backdowns which have characterised the way those opposite have gone about the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we couldn't believe the first seven budgets handed down by those opposite then obviously the eighth is not worth the paper that it's written on as well, with one exception—that is, that cut to real wages that the government themselves admit is at the core of their budget. This is not a number that we've generated. It's not a forecast that we've come up with. Right there in the government's own budget is a cut to real wages. Penetrating this haze of marketing, spin, self-congratulation and self-regard is one little kernel of searing honesty, which is that Australian workers will be worse off at the end of all of this than they were at the beginning. That is the outcome of the budget of those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House we find it hard to understand how those opposite can be so happy with themselves when we've got almost two million unemployed or underemployed and when we've still got all of this wage stagnation, job insecurity and all the rest of it. But then we are reminded almost every day that, in another burst of searing honesty, the former finance minister—the longest-serving minister on that side of the House—said that stagnant wages growth was a deliberate design feature of their economic policy. So no wonder they think 'mission accomplished' when it comes to this budget, because they are never happier than when the working people of this country are being held back. They are never happier than when they can screw down people's wages and treat them like an input cost into business rather than human beings that want to work hard to provide for the people they love. They are never happier than when that is the outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economy is emerging from the deepest, most damaging recession in almost 100 years. It brought to an end almost three decades of continuous economic growth. This side of the House is especially proud of starting that economic growth and having saved it when it was at maximum risk just over 10 years ago. But we've had this recession. As we emerge from it, the task of all of us in this building, all of us in this House, is to do what we can to make the economy and society stronger after COVID-19 than it was before COVID-19. In recognising that the economy is recovering, the lion's share of the credit goes to the Australian people who did the right thing by each other. They made sacrifices for each other to limit the spread of this virus, and in that sacrifice lay the kernel of this country's success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But all of that is being put at risk by the political approach of those opposite—the marketing and spin; the chasm between announcement and delivery. All of that momentum, which is a tribute to the Australian people, is put at risk in at least three ways by the way those opposite go about governing the country. The first is this vaccinations debacle. We saw it again in question time today. The Treasurer, the Prime Minister, the health minister in the media earlier today and the finance minister, all have a different story to tell about when Australians will be vaccinated. The budget was an opportunity for this government to come clean on the costs and consequences of completely stuffing up the vaccine rollout. Instead we are more confused. The Australian people are more confused now than before the budget on when they will get vaccinated and what that means for the economy. As the member for Dobell said, we cannot have a first-rate economic recovery if we have a third-rate vaccine rollout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recovery is also put at risk by the fact that those opposite, particularly the Prime Minister, but also the Treasurer and all of the cabinet, are always looking for a political angle, they're always looking for a way to get themselves through the next election. When the country desperately needed a plan for good, secure, well-paid jobs to grow the economy in a broad, inclusive and sustainable way, to repair our economy, and, in doing so, help to repair our society after COVID-19—instead of taking the longer term view, those opposite are always playing the angles. All the money that was sprayed around last night was not because they believe there's an issue in aged care or child care or skills and training. If they believed in any of these things, they would have done something on any of the other days in the past eight years they have been in office. Instead, they take this overtly political approach to this country and to its people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night's budget had a number of deficits in it. At the very core there were obviously deficits as far as the eye could see. But perhaps the biggest deficit in the budget last night was a deficit of vision. There was a deficit of vision when it came to what this country could be and what role we wanted to give the Australian people in the future of this place, and how we give them a slice of the action as the economy recovers. We recognise that a recovery is not a recovery at all if working people are left behind, if working people don't get a look in. That is the most important task of this budget, and that is the task that those opposite failed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, with this deficit of vision, it is left to Labor, under the member for Grayndler and our colleagues on this side of the House, to provide that vision. We will show the Australian people that, as we recover from COVID-19, and as the economy starts to gather pace, we can make sure the Australian people, and particularly Australian workers, are front and centre and that they benefit from this recovery. If they don't, this budget's not worth the paper it's written on.</span>

It takes a special kind of member, like the member for Rankin and the member for Ballarat, to get up here and deliver a 10-minute negative speech about what's wrong with this country when we've just seen what's happening here in Australia in the middle of a pandemic where Australians are being kept safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I couldn't help but notice the member for Ballarat went on about infrastructure spending during question time. With $110 billion of funding for infrastructure, she wanted to mention some page buried deep in the budget papers—a $188.7 million underspend this year out of $110 billion infrastructure spend. If the member for Rankin and the member for Ballarat are so concerned about infrastructure, they should pick up the phone to the incompetent Palaszczuk government in Queensland and talk to their mate Mark Bailey, who cannot deliver a project in Queensland in a timely manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate of Petrie, residents and people on the north side of Brisbane would know that projects like Linkfield Road at Carseldine and Bald Hills was promised and funded 2½ years ago, and we're still waiting on the Palaszczuk government to do it. I had a briefing from TMR the other day. They said to me, 'We're going to start in 2023.' Have a guess at when it will be finished. They said to me, 'It's going to be finished in October 2024, right when the next state election is due.' I said to them, 'This isn't good enough.' The member for Lilley and others on that side should pick up their phone to the Palaszczuk government and say that the constituents in our communities on the north side of Brisbane cannot wait another three years for these roads to be built. The federal funding is ready to go. It's available now. It's on the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just that project, either. It's the on and off ramps at Griffin and Murrumba Downs. It's the second Gateway upgrade project, from St John Fisher all the way to the Pine River. The member opposite really doesn't understand. The first GUN project was promised prior to the 2013 election, which we won, and it's now finished. I will move on and say that those opposite are very negative, and it's not what Australians are looking for at this time.</span>

                  </a>  As we emerge from this once-in-a-century pandemic faster and stronger, the 2021-22 budget cements our recovery in a highly uncertain world. Unemployment is at 5.6 per cent, which is lower than when those opposite left office. Australians can be optimistic about the budget, which turbocharges our strengths and provides support where it is needed. Our economy has outperformed all major advanced economies this year. Almost half a million jobs have been created since the last budget, in many cases by businesses, and we thank them for it. We have reached pre-pandemic levels of employment, and unemployment is on a trajectory to go down below five per cent for only the second time in the last 50 years. For the second time in the last five decades, unemployment is due to drop to under five per cent. We've saved lives and we've saved livelihoods. All you need to do is look around at what is going on throughout the world right now, every day. We have avoided the loss of life seen elsewhere in the world, with fewer infections, hospitalisations and deaths than most other countries, and we've emerged resilient, with consumer sentiment the highest in 11 years. And what did we get from the shadow Treasurer after the budget? Ten minutes of negativity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer's budget last night supports everyday Australians in their comeback. There are personal income tax cuts, which is more money in the hand for workers; business tax incentives, which help workers; new apprenticeships and training places; more infrastructure; and record funding for schools, hospitals, aged care—which I'm very passionate about—mental health and the NDIS. In Petrie, I thank those involved in delivering the essential services we all rely on. There have been 341,636 telehealth consultations through Medicare since the start of the pandemic, and these services are now being extended. The 2021-22 budget will deliver more tax relief to around 70,600 taxpayers in Petrie, up to $2,745 this year, because of the Morrison government's tax relief plan. Make no mistake about it: this means more money for Australians, in their pockets. It means more productivity for businesses. And, when the employment market is in full swing, it will mean rising wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also extends the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements scheme, which has already helped over 140,000 apprentices secure their future. A further 170,000 new apprenticeship and trainee places will be delivered. Just this week, as the Assistant Minister for Youth and Employment Services, I met two young people, Patrick and Ella, when I visited Thor Building Products in Northgate. Patrick and Ella are employed by one of the 53,000 employers participating in the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements scheme, and 64 per cent of apprenticeships and traineeships registered for the wage subsidy are under 24 years of age. Patrick, who went to school with my son and finished year 12 last year at St Patrick's College at Shorncliffe, said to me that the job has given him security. He moved from casual to full-time work thanks to the BAC scheme and now has a way to plan for his future. His words to me, without any prompting at all, were: 'It's helped me get out of underemployment, and I'm now able to save for what I'm wanting to save for.' This year's budget is all about the Australian people and keeping our economy on the right track. That is what we're doing. It's all about Australians; it's not about us. It's not about this place. It's those out there. In the Petrie electorate, every day I am focused on the people that I represent. As I move about the country, in my role on youth and employment services, along with the minister here next to me, I'm focusing on trying to help Australians every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now is a time to futureproof jobs. There has never been a better time for anyone to reinvent themselves. The extended JobTrainer Fund nationwide will deliver 500,000 new places. Small and medium businesses, of course, are the backbone of this nation and my community. In Petrie, there are around 19,800 businesses that take advantage of the write-off of the full value of the eligible asset that they purchase—the instant asset tax write-off. I've had at least half a dozen businesses in the last two months alone that have said: 'We want to thank you. Please pass on to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer what we've been able to do with the instant asset tax write-off. We've been able to buy new equipment.' One of the businesses up in Burpengary East has completely sold out of trucks. They've got none left, because people have been taking advantage of the instant asset tax write-off. The budget will deliver to a further 6,500 businesses in Petrie that will be able to use the extended loss carry-back measure to support cash flow and confidence, which helps staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also increasing funding for preschools and making child care more affordable and accessible. Childcare reforms in this budget will directly benefit over 1,700 families in Petrie alone. As we emerge as a more resilient nation, I want to thank those frontline workers guaranteeing essential services. Businesses are growing and creating jobs for parents, teachers and everyday Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also invests in a dynamic and competitive recovery. That's why the Treasurer can confirm the government will back Australians with a $1.2 billion digital economy, including digital skill cadetships. From 2016 to 2019, I chaired the communications and arts committee. I don't know that there are any other members from that here, but we recommended an offset for the gaming industry. The government announced last night a 30 per cent refundable digital games tax offset to try and attract more of the $250 billion global game market to Australia. To get the offset, eligible businesses have to spend at least $500,000 on certain games expenditure, but this will help. The offset is part of the government's $1.2 billion package. The package also includes money to improve MyGov and the My Health Record, as well as money to research artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. This budget is about creating jobs, rebuilding and guaranteeing essential services. The Morrison government is focused on Australians. Those opposite have nothing but negativity.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:33</span>):  The Prime Minister has completely lost the plot, and so has the Treasurer. It's wages, wages, wages. He's telling Australians that the economy is roaring back, but at the same time his blueprint for economic recovery has got real wage cuts within it. There can be no economic recovery built on wage cuts for ordinary Australians, but this is what this Prime Minister and this Treasurer are trying to ask Australians to believe. His blueprint for economic recovery is leaving ordinary Australians behind. Prices are up, and wages are down. This is an eight-year pattern under this government. The only thing that is different under this government is that, for the last seven budgets, they've predicted wages would go up, but they never did. The difference under this one is there's a bit of honesty in the budget papers. They say that wages are going to go down and stay down, and that's their economic recipe under this government. If that was all there was, you'd have enough to worry about, but, on top of that, workers earning less than $90,000 a year are going to get a tax increase. They're going to get a tax hike next July. They won't tell you this, but workers earning less than $90,000 a year are being promised a tax hike from next July. That's the truth. High-paid workers get a tax cut; low-paid workers get a tax increase. That's the recipe under this government. It tells you everything. There are JobKeeper subsidies going to businesses that are handing out big dividends and bonuses to big executives—$10 billion worth of JobKeeper subsidies going to their mates at the same time that they're sending 'please explain' robodebt letters to people who owe a few dollars under Centrelink payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard a lot said about housing under this government, and I'm pleased to join them on this debate. Over the last 20 years, home prices have gone up by over 150 per cent. Wages have not kept up. In fact, home prices have gone up more than five times wages over the last 20 years. Over the course of the pandemic, prices have actually gone galloping ahead. If you look at the return on a house in Sydney today, you see it actually returns more than the average worker makes in Sydney today. The shorthand is that you can't afford to live in Sydney, yet these guys are telling you that they are the party of homeownership. If they were the party of homeownership, they'd make it easier for workers to get into the housing market by providing a wage rise. Under this government, house prices are going through the roof and wages are going through the floor. They are making it harder, not easier, for Australians to get into the housing market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over in Treasury and over on the backbench, they're all scratching their heads and saying, 'What are we going to do to get wages moving again?' We've got an answer to that. It was invented a long time ago. It was called unions. They were part of the solution during the pandemic. The government went to the unions during the pandemic and said, 'We need your help to sort out some of these conditions so that we can keep business viable,' but, when we're talking about the recovery, they slam the door in the face of the unions. If they wanted a plan for wage rises, they'd be sitting down and talking to the unions, not slamming the doors in their face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Liberal Party, wage restraint and wage cuts are a design feature. Under the Labor Party, working with the unions, working with workers and working with employees is what we do. That's in our DNA. It ensures that, as the economy recovers, ordinary workers and households get a wage increase and share in the recovery. Under the Liberals, the design feature of a recovery is prices going up and wages going down except for some of them. Wages go down and prices go up. No worker is going to share in the recovery, and that is the design feature of this budget. It is there in black and white in their budget papers: prices go up, wages go down and there is no plan for workers to share in the recovery.</span>

                  <a href="218019" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  I was thinking about why the opposition are constantly negative about everything. Never a positive sound comes out of the other side on any subject that is ever debated in this place. I think I know what part of it is. I think that, when you lose seven of the last nine elections—when in seven of the last nine elections the Australian people have said, 'We don't put our faith and trust in you'—it makes it very difficult to find your happy place. I think it makes it very difficult for you to find your happy place when the Australian public has said no to you seven out of nine times. I think that's what's going on, because there is much to celebrate about Australia right now. There is much to celebrate about us economically. There's much to celebrate about us on the health front. But you never hear anything about that from those opposite. You never hear any positive statement on any subject.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that at the start of COVID Treasury was saying that, if the government didn't do something, there was the potential for unemployment to go to 15 per cent in this country, that we could lose 20 per cent of our economy given the shutdowns that had to happen when the global pandemic was declared. That was the forecast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through a whole lot of economic programs like JobKeeper and many others, what we have managed to achieve—with the help of the Australian people in adhering to social distancing, hand hygiene and a whole lot of other activities—is to cap the unemployment rate. It stopped going up at 7½ per cent, and since then it has gone from 7½ per cent to 5.6 per cent. In the budget papers presented last night, it's predicted to go below five. Is there a happy place you can find about that? No. Can you acknowledge that? No, because you've been in opposition too long to celebrate anything about this country. You've been in opposition too long to see any positivity about what is going on in this country. We are the third-fastest-growing economy in the world. Do you hear anything about that? No, you don't hear anything positive come out of anyone over there, and that's why the Australian public don't trust them. That's why the Australian public keep saying no: because they don't trust you. They don't trust you, because you can't say anything positive about this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might say that they might be able to find a happy place about something with the pandemic. We are seeing another wave sweep through the developing world. We are seeing third and fourth waves pop up in other countries. Again, in Australia there is some great news. You can't eliminate this virus, but on so many levels we have combated it, fought it and contained it—again, with the great cooperation and the great attitudes of the Australian public. We have all but eliminated this virus. We have few outbreaks, and when we do have outbreaks we get them under control very well. Is there anything positive about that? No, there is no happy place for those opposite on that either. They will pick on any piece of negativity they can find on the economy or on health—again, no happy place with those opposite. That is why the Australian public do not trust them and do not vote them into government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would throw this challenge out to those opposite: if everything is so bad here, tell me one country you would rather be in right now, on either a health front or an economic front, than Australia. Tell me one place in the world you would rather be in right now than Australia, on either a health front or an economic front. I don't think there is one. I think Australia is a great nation. I think Australia is a great country. I think we are doing exceptionally well on the very severe challenges that we face, as the globe does, on a health front and on an economic front. There is some great news. There are some great statistics in last night's budget. We will continue as a government to look out for the Australian public, on the health front and on the economic front, and that's why Australians put their faith and trust in us, not you.</span>

Despite it being 2021, they still don't admit women as members. Last year, they doubled their surplus, thanks in part to $2 million from the government's JobKeeper program. Accent Group, the shoe seller, paid their CEO a million-dollar bonus, boosted their profits and delivered, through dividends, $11 million to billionaire Brett Blundy. They've gotten $45 million through JobKeeper, and they won't pay a cent of it back. The car dealer AP Eagers turned a $200 million profit. Their dividends will deliver $17 million to billionaire Nick Politis, but they won't return their $130 million in JobKeeper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's Best &amp; Less. Their profits are up, but, because they're doing a sale, they've actually come clean with investors. They have said to investors that JobKeeper was a sugar hit, directly delivering more than $20 million to their budget bottom line. I imagine Best &amp; Less are thinking, 'You only get one Morrison government in your lifetime, and we've had ours.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's Premier Investments. They may have received as much as $110 million in JobKeeper. They set a record profit and paid their CEO a $2.5 million bonus, more than most Australians earn in a lifetime. They paid a stonking dividend, of which billionaire Solomon Lew will get a sizable whack, and are refusing to repay the bulk of their JobKeeper. The government set up the 'DobSeeker' helpline which employers can call to dob in jobseekers. There is no helpline which people can call up and complain about the billions of dollars that this government has delivered to profitable firms. Among the listed firms we know that about a fifth of the money went to firms whose earnings went up, not down. If that's true, that means that across the entire scheme we are talking about some $15 billion to $20 billion delivered to firms that didn't need it. That's about $1,000 of Morrison government waste for every single Australian. It's $1,000 dollars per adult wasted through the JobKeeper scheme—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a better way. In 1945 Curtin and Chifley didn't just say, 'Let's put the country back the way it was in 1939.' Instead they had a bit of ambition. As Liam Byrne reports in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Becoming John Curtin and James Scullin</span>: 'Curtin pledged that under his government Australia would not just win the war, but win the peace too. There would be investment in social services, new housing to replace the old slums, new opportunities to be pursued and full employment for the benefit of all.' It was a vision of what Australia could be. It was based upon the belief that if the government could expand its power and influence over the workings of the economy and society to mobilise the nation to win the war, then it could do so to ensure the social betterment of all. As Liam Byrne has said: 'The Curtin government moulded the age. It actively created a new era, transforming our economy, our politics and our society. It defied the inherited orthodoxies and expanded the bounds of the possible.' That is what ambition looks like. That is what a reforming government would be doing today to ensure that wages went up, not down; to ensure that we had a more egalitarian nation, not a less egalitarian nation; to ensure that we tackled climate change, which will hit Australia harder than any other advanced country; to see improvements in productivity, in business startup rates; to create a better Australia. Australia deserves a bold budget, not the flaccid financial statement we got last night.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  I always enjoy following the member for Fenner. He is always so erudite and so wise on the history of his party. It's just a shame that the future that Labor would offer us is a return to the 1940s. Maybe they want to reintroduce petrol rationing. Maybe they want to send the troops down the mines again. But when they think about the future they are always looking to the past. That is a good way to think about Labor's response to this budget because past performance is a good indicator of future performance, and Labor have a history of misreading budgets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the last budget the member for Rankin said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Decisions taken by the Liberals in their budget mean that the … recession will be deeper and longer than necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Unemployment will be too high for too long in this country because the government is failing on jobs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Rankin could be no further from the truth on this budget than he was on the last one. The truth is what this budget is doing is setting Australia up, through the Morrison government's plan, to secure Australia's economic recovery with a very strong focus on jobs. I think our record on jobs underlies the fact that this budget is the best received budget in a generation, so those opposite, unfortunately, have very little to say. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 5.6 percent unemployment rate that we now have is lower than when we came to government in 2013. Treasury said to us at the beginning of the COVID recession that unemployment could reach 15 per cent, or two million Australians out of work. Unemployment is even lower than when the COVID pandemic began. There is a record set of job ads—243,500 job ads. Over 12 months, there was a 245 per cent increase in the number of job ads, showing how buoyant the economy is and how many opportunities there are for people. More Australians in jobs means more taxpayers, it means more revenue for government, it means fewer people dependent on welfare and it means a lower deficit. JobKeeper, which has been described as a lifeline and a godsend by so many businesses in my electorate, kept 3.8 million people in work and JobSeeker helped 1.5 million people without work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor talks about wages, but I think the important points to note here are that real wages to the December quarter were higher than when we came into office in 2013, and Treasury says that we need to get unemployment with a four in front of it until we can accelerate wages growth for the long term. So what do we as a government do to put more money in people's pockets, so citizens and workers have more money? Well, the first thing we are always committed to as Liberals and Nationals is tax cuts. Tax cuts are in our DNA. Why are they in our DNA? It's because we believe fundamentally that individuals can spend their own money better than the government can. Under the government's tax policies, there's $7.8 billion worth of personal income tax cuts for lower- and middle-income earners. Individuals will be $1,080 better off and couples will be $2,160 better off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are trying drive the unemployment rate lower, below five per cent. Treasury says that the initiatives we've put in this budget will help create 250,000 jobs. That's on top of the half a million we've created since the last budget last October and the million that we've created since the COVID recession began. How are we doing that? What do we do to create more jobs? We expand JobTrainer, with more than 450,000 places to upskill jobseekers, and 170,000 new apprenticeships and trainees with the 50 per cent wage subsidy that has been such a success. As I go around my electorate talking to people in the horticulture industry, in the automotive industry and in restaurants and so on, more people are putting on apprentices for the first time because of the significant wage subsidy that we've offered. There are the 5,000 additional places in higher education for short courses to help upskill people; the increases in mutual obligation that we've put in place to ensure that people who are offered jobs take the jobs that they're offered; the increases in child care for low- and middle-income earners to ensure that child care is more affordable for working people; the infrastructure plan that we have—$15 billion in infrastructure in every state and territory, which will increase jobs right across our economy; and the special arrangements for businesses to encourage them to take on more workers by giving them more of their own money through the extension of programs like the instant asset write-off. The Morrison government is successfully managing Australia's future, because we have a plan to secure Australia's economic recovery.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  I always find budget night—certainly for the last eight years of this government—really quite disappointing. That's not because of what the government does but because it has such a small ambition for this country. The government's ambition for this country is so, so small. There's a function that government has that only government can do. That is to look forward at what is coming down the road towards your country, what the opportunities and the threats are, and position your country so that the population of the country and the business of the country don't fall into a hole—to make sure that the country is ready for the change that's coming down the track. That is called leading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government doesn't know how to do that. This government not only waits until the problem is well known by experts; it waits until everybody knows about the problem. It waits until the crisis is so great that the population is screaming for an answer, and then it puts its hand and up and says, 'We'll do something about that.' But let me say this, you of small ambition: after eight years of government, if there's a crisis in this country its yours. If there's a crisis in aged care, it's yours. It's a federal responsibility. If there's a crisis after eight years of a Liberal government, you should have done something about it before, and you should have seen it coming: the ageing of the population, climate change, growing gig work, the changing nature of data and its role, the decline in economies of scale as a source of competitive advantage, the ageing of the population, and the fragmentation of supply chains and what that means for our tax revenue. These are things that we all know about. We know they're coming, and yet this is a government that doesn't even look at them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that when it comes to climate change we have a problem: a Liberal government has never governed in its own right ever in its entire history. It needs the Nationals to govern, so there's a bit of an agreement going on, and no-one knows what it is. I understand the problem. But their role is to do something about it; their role is to look forward and do something about it, and yet they wait for the crisis. It's as if the marketing Prime Minister has decided, 'Let's not bother to do anything about it until everybody knows.' There's no point in solving a problem if no-one knows there was a problem in the first place! There's no point in that for Mr Marketing Man, 'Let's wait until the crisis is so great that everyone knows about it and we can take the credit for solving it.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You could be forgiven for believing that that's what this government are doing, because for so many years they've ignored the extraordinary crises that have been decimating some people in our communities. There's aged care: malnutrition and people lying in faeces. There are, literally, people dying while waiting for home-care packages—really. Let's look at aged care just for a moment, because it's actually really quite interesting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged-care royal commission, which we called for for ages, was called in October 2018. There was an interim report, called <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>, on 31 October 2019. The crisis was known before the calling of the aged-care royal commission. It was certainly known in all of its glory on 31 October 2019, and this government sat on its hands while people literally suffered—while families suffered. Then, during COVID: 'Aged-care? Not our problem.' It was their problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at child care. There's a childcare package in the budget—well, so there should be. When Prime Minister Scott Morrison was still the minister, he offered the best-ever package of child care in 2015, just before an election. He didn't legislate it until 2017. He introduced it in 2018, just before an election—surprise, surprise! But over the 2½ years since then all the benefit has dissipated, so we're back to square one. In fact, we're worse off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, just before an election again, there's another announcement. There's a pattern with this government: wait until the crisis is really, really great and then wait until an election year comes along and announce it. Wait until the crisis comes. Their ambition is so small; they're the wrong government for the times that we're in. We're in a world that's changing rapidly, where the opportunities have to be grasped and where they have to do things in a country where the population doesn't even know there's a problem because they're ahead of it—because they're leaders and can see what opportunities are coming down the road, and they put Australia in position for them. That's the job of a government all the time, but at no time in Australia's history has it been more relevant than it is now. And that is not those over there; they're the wrong government for the time, and the budget shows it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a budget where they solve the crises that they've caused—that they sat on and ignored for eight years. Then, finally, they put their hands up and said, 'We're doing something about it in an election year,' and they expect praise for it. To the previous speaker, who asked, 'Why don't they find something good to say about the government,' it's because their ambition is too small, too little and too late. They're solving the problems that they caused and then they expect credit for it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="80072" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HAMMOND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  As the Treasurer said in his budget speech last night, the 2021-22 budget is designed to secure Australia's economic recovery. This budget, and the economic plan which underpins it, will continue to set the right environment for the creation of more jobs. It's on this point that I will probably irritate a lot of my colleagues, who have been referring to the creation of jobs and that we want to create jobs. We are, in fact, a government that likes to create the environment for others to create jobs, so I'm just being a little pedantic here. Eight out of 10 jobs in Australia are actually found in private enterprise, so our view, as a government, is not only being one of lower taxes and smaller government but also one which creates the right environment so that other people can thrive and, in the case of employment, create jobs for others. That's what we want to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than focus on what the alleged gaps are in this budget, let's look at what this budget does in terms of our values and what we're seeking to do in Australia. The first of those is that it provides tax relief for more than 10 million hardworking Australians so that they have more money in their pockets to spend in the way that they want to spend it. In my electorate of Curtin 73,000 people last year benefited from tax cuts, and 52,000 people are going to benefit from the tax cuts being introduced this year. This is helping all of those people in my electorate to make the choices that we know that they can make and to spend money in the way that they want to, hopefully, by buying Australian, buying locally made and supporting all of our great businesses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that this government is doing to make sure that we're creating the right environment for more jobs is supporting small and medium-sized businesses. Having more jobs is our goal. Having more jobs means more tax is collected, and it allows us to provide essential services. Throughout COVID, the initiatives that we put in place supported over 25,000 small businesses in my electorate. Those initiatives, which are continuing through this budget, are, again, going to support those small and local businesses in my electorate. Around 25,000 businesses are going to be able to write off the full value of any eligible asset they purchase, and about 12,000 businesses are going to be able to use the extended carry-back measure to support cash flow and confidence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than creating jobs and employing people, we are investing in giving people the opportunities to develop further skills and training so that they can go out and seek other job opportunities. The expanded JobTrainer Fund is going to support 163,000 new training places. An additional 163,000 people are going to be able to upskill. They are going to be able to go out and search for jobs in areas that they might not be qualified to work in at the moment. There are also going to be 170,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships. Once again, this will create an environment for people to go out, seek employment and get new skills. We have 680 apprenticeships in Curtin. I'm sure that, with these new measures, we'll have a whole lot more people seeking apprenticeships and traineeships over the coming year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that our government does, as opposed to employing people and becoming a direct employer of people, is invest in infrastructure. By investing in infrastructure and putting things out to tender, we get companies and local businesses benefitting from major infrastructure projects. I don't particularly get excited by road infrastructure, but $1. 6 billion is being spent on infrastructure in Western Australia, and I am excited about it. It will make all of those road trips to get home to your families safer and smoother, which is really important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is also making it easier for people to get more hours. For those parents who need to access child care to take on additional work, this government is investing an additional $1.7 billion into child care. This is going to directly benefit about 1,100 families in Curtin, by helping them take on more work. I know a number of them who have reached out to me over the last couple of months will be pleased with this initiative. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially, our government is one that wants to support people to make their own choices. We want to create the environment for jobs. We want to create the environment for others to actually get out there and do things, to start their businesses and employ people, and for people feel confident to go ahead. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="264121" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WELLS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  They say that this is a budget for pandemic recovery. What they mean is that this is a budget for political recovery. The Morrison government's media release for their federal budget infrastructure investment should have read: 'The Morrison government manages to spray $589 billion but still miss one of the fastest growing corridors in the country.' They have not announced a single cent for infrastructure in my electorate of Lilley. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really made it as easy as humanly possible for the Morrison government. I spent six months asking my electorate's constituents what they wanted from the federal budget. I asked them online. I asked them at mobile offices. I compiled all of their answers. I sorted and prioritised all of their answers based on numbers. I literally hand-delivered a list of projects, crowdsourced from my constituents. I tidied it up into a neat little eight-page document. I sought to table it in the House, and, when I was denied, I walked it around to the Treasurer's office. I physically handed this document over. I could not have made it simpler for the Morrison government to assist people in Lilley and provide vital infrastructure, yet they have still managed to squib it. It is actually unbelievable how incompetent this government can be when they've had eight years of practice at this point. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was nothing for Gympie Road, which the Morrison government's own Infrastructure Priority List categorises as high priority. There was nothing for the Rode Road, Beckett Road and Queens Road roundabout near McDowall primary school. There was nothing for Robinson Road West in Aspley and Geebung—a boundary I share with the member for Petrie. There was nothing for sound barriers along the Gateway Motorway in Deagon to curb increased noise for residents who live near the Gateway Arterial Road. There was no park and ride for the 750 commuters who try to park at Northgate on weekdays to get to work. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer need to face up in question time and explain to my 108,000 constituents why these desperately needed Northside infrastructure projects were not funded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget, which we hear was aimed at addressing the perception that the coalition doesn't care about women, seems to involve returning a lot of money to essential services that they have spent eight years cutting. I spoke with two community centres in my electorate last week, ahead of the budget, and their feedback was unanimous: the emergency COVID funding distributed to the state governments should never have been emergency COVID funding, because they desperately needed that same funding long before COVID ever hit and they will continue to need it for years after COVID has gone. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Northside Connect, in Nundah, used their funding to increase their family solicitor's hours by one day a week, and they hired a new legal support officer to help women who are fleeing domestic violence to navigate that process and complete all of the paperwork. But they still have a three-week waitlist of women who need their help, and that money expires on 30 June. SANDBAG also received modest emergency funding, but it is nowhere near enough to support the immense pressure they are under. To date this year, SANDBAG has processed over 200 police referrals for counselling about domestic violence. They are well on their way, in Sandgate, to having triple the number of referrals about domestic violence that they received last year. Triple since last year—that's how bad domestic violence has gotten since the start of COVID. They have 80 women waiting for counselling—80 women who have fled domestic violence and now must wait six months to receive any counselling support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sharon, Yolandi and Nicki at Northside Connect and Kylie and her volunteers at SANDBAG are busting their guts every single day to help women fleeing domestic violence. The emergency funding that they, together, received from the federal government—from this Morrison government—is still less than what the member for Bowman will continue to get paid in his remaining time in parliament. That is the priority of this government. When it's all said and done, when we sift the actions from the words, that is where they are choosing to put their money. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They say this is a budget for pandemic recovery, but it is actually a budget for political recovery. Half of one per cent, or $3.4 billion, of the whole budget of $589 billion is going to women's economic security. We're about to hear what an amazing priority women's economic security is, but it is half of one per cent of the entire budget. That is a pretty shady ladies' budget if you ask me. Half of that is $1.7 billion for child care, because apparently child care is only a problem for women, according to the Morrison government. Apparently child care isn't a problem for parents or a policy issue for Australian families; it's just something to hand to the ladies as an offering—asking for forgiveness after all of the crimes they have committed over eight years.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  Here we go again: the usual whingefest from the other side. I'll start with the member for Rankin, who said that our budget and all the things we have achieved since we've been in government are all spin. But I'd like to remind them about concrete, steel, buildings, dams, roads and bridges. They are all really important bits of infrastructure. In my own electorate, I can think of 12 bridges that have been improved and rebuilt courtesy of the Bridges Renewal Program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just the other day we announced a flyover across the Pacific Highway between Coopernook and Harrington—$48 million into this much-needed $60 million project. Just last week I was with the Prime Minister at Newcastle Airport. That's going to turbocharge tourism, freight and industry in the Hunter region and up the North Coast, because we're spending $66 million expanding the capability of the runway. The international airport in Newcastle will become a reality. The expansion of the Newcastle Airport terminal will go ahead. The Astra Aerolab development in the Newcastle Airport precinct will take off, literally. It's already there, and it's going to expand exponentially.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On dams: we have contributed at a federal level to the Rookwood Weir, which is being constructed as we speak, up in Queensland. The Chaffey Dam, in New South Wales, has already had an extension of the dam wall height. These are concrete things being delivered. The National Water Infrastructure Development Fund has delivered pipelines and improvements and recycling of water—all sorts of water projects—around the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite complain about job security. We have just been through the worst economic shock the country has faced since the Depression and World War II. What have we done? We've bounced back exponentially. We have 75,000 more people in employment now than before COVID. During the COVID pandemic we put in place JobKeeper, JobSeeker, improved cash flow and extra support for aged care, tourism and the arts sector. We have had one million jobs since May 2020. There have been 440,000 more jobs since the last budget in October. The participation rate in employment is up. Female employment is at an all-time high, at 61.8 per cent. The most important thing is to have people in employment. Consumer sentiment is up. There's been a surge in apprenticeships because of the 50 per cent subsidies we have put in place. In my electorate we have got over 1,200 apprentices benefiting from this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The instant asset write-off is continuing; there has been an exponential increase in businesses in my electorate and around the country using this to get new equipment in their factories and businesses. The loss carry-back provision is still available for businesses as well. We have delivered small and medium-sized businesses a tax cut, down to 25 per cent, as part of our company tax plan. The patent box tax treatment was just announced last night. That means that, with the amazing intellectual property and all the innovations that Australian businesses come up with, the companies that keep that IP here and develop it will get a preferential tax rate of 17 per cent for that portion of their company's business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have more elderly residents requiring aged care in my electorate than any other electorate, and I'm so pleased we've got $17.7 billion more going into the aged-care system, both in home-care places and in residential aged care. Across the nation, 17,000 families will benefit from the changes to child care when they have more than one child in child care. It means they will be able to work if they choose to and get more income so they can save and get ahead. There's been a surge in first home buyers because of the HomeBuilder initiative. It's also turbocharged our economy. The construction industry is powering ahead. We'll have a whole new generation of people getting into their first home because of that. We're helping so many people— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMN" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  by leave—Today, in my capacity as acting Minister for Women, I am pleased to speak to the Women's Budget Statement 2021-22, a $3.4 billion landmark investment in sustained and practical outcomes for Australian women and girls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In achieving this, I acknowledge the dedicated and rigorous work of the Cabinet Task Force on Women's Safety and Economic Security, led by the Prime Minister and by Minister Payne from the other place. I would also like to acknowledge the work of Minister Ruston and her contributions as the first women's safety minister, and Minister Hume in her work as the first Minister for Women's Economic Security. And Minister Ruston has just joined us in the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the cabinet task force, established by the Prime Minister, came together for the inaugural meeting on 6 April, we set ourselves an ambitious agenda, an agenda informed by our core values: respect, dignity, choice, justice and equality of opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In announcing the cabinet task force, the Prime Minister said that it would bring fresh lens to achieving the outcomes we all want for women across our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Women's Budget Statement is an early and significant milestone in the work of the task force, and forms part of a continuum of effort by this government throughout its term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government remains committed to ensuring every Australian woman has every opportunity to reach their full potential, contributing to our communities, society and economy in the ways they choose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already made a significant investment in realising that commitment. And I can assure you that this government and in particular the women's task force are determined to keep striving for further change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there is more to do to assure women's safety, economic security, health and wellbeing, while opening the pathways for women to thrive and lead in their chosen pursuits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For this country to be the best it can be, we need to support and create opportunities for Australian women and girls to be the best they can be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the work that we all do in this place, we strive to foster an Australian society where women and men, girls and boys live and work and grow together in a spirit and culture of equality and mutual respect. Gender should not determine our level of opportunity or our level of ambition; these should be universal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we continue to focus on our economic and health recovery from COVID, women's workforce participation is at a record high of 61.8 per cent and the gender pay gap is down to its lowest level at 13.4 per cent. Neither of these figures is where they should be, but we are proud of the changes that are in progress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I can announce that we are close to meeting the target we set in 2016 of 50 per cent women's representation on Australian government boards: as at 31 December 2020, a record 49.5 per cent of Australian government board positions were held by women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One woman on a board is a start, two is a voice, but parity in leadership and decision-making means that we all benefit as we draw on women's and men's experiences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With this as our ambition and our imperative, let me outline this year's women's budget measures, starting with $1.1 billion to prevent and respond to violence against women and their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women need to be safe and women need to be able to achieve financial independence and economic security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is also investing a further $1.9 billion dedicated to the economic security of women, including $1.7 billion on top of our existing $10 billion-a-year commitment to child care, ensuring that women and their families have greater choice about how to manage family and work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we recognise there is more to do. In this women's budget, we are making targeted investments:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">to combat violence against women and sexual harassment;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">to further increase women's workforce participation and narrow the gender pay gap; </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">to give greater choice and flexibility for families to manage work and care;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">to increase women's financial security; and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">to improve women's health and wellbeing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it be the sickening and sadly too frequent incidences of intimate partner violence, or the emerging challenges of online abuse and harassment and stalking, violence in all the pernicious forms it takes must stop. Everyone has the right to safety, in their homes, workplaces, place of study, in the community and online—everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge the many women and children who have experienced or are experiencing harrowing family, domestic and sexual violence—every one of their stories tells us how we can and must do better. We thank victim-survivors for their bravery in telling their stories and the frontline workers, such as those I met with recently in Albury at Betty's Place and the other services I have seen across the state. These women work tirelessly. They are intervening at the point of crisis with compassion and insight. They are working every day to support women leaving violent relationships and improve their long-term outcomes. The evolving service delivery at Betty's Place reminds us of the particular challenges faced by rural and regional women. Services such as those in our rural and regional cities fill a vital need for support for victims and survivors. And the best way we can support them is to stop it at the start. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget commits $1.1 billion for women's safety, the largest single Commonwealth investment in women's safety in a federal budget. This investment provides funding for: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">prevention and frontline services;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">perpetrator interventions;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">research and building our evidence base; and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">addressing emerging issues, including the increasing use and sophistication of technology to facilitate abuse and other forms of non-physical violence such as coercive control. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This represents the Commonwealth's down payment on the next national plan which will commence in mid-2022, after consultations including the National Women's Safety Summit to be held at the end of July. The Commonwealth is working with states and territories to develop the next national plan, acknowledging the need for all governments to play a role. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committing:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">up to $261.4 million over two years to negotiate a new national partnership agreement with states and territories to bolster frontline family, domestic and sexual violence supports to ensure women and children can access support when they need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">$164.8 million over three years for a two-year trial to provide immediate financial assistance to women leaving violent relationships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met recently with Women's Safety NSW CEO Hayley Foster and was honoured to witness the incredible work that the court advocacy service provides. I sat in the Downing Centre local court and watched as advocates supported women on their path to justice. We know that the pursuit of justice is fraught, and we can do more to support women through the processes and improve their access to autonomous justice. We are committing $416.2 million over four years to support women and families experiencing domestic and family violence by increasing their access to a range of legal and other support services, and a national information sharing framework to improve information sharing between the family law, family violence and child protection systems. This includes $129 million in increased funding to the states and territories for legal assistance services. Children's contact services will be expanded and enhanced to manage the needs of separating families across Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is making significant strides in supporting women and children from diverse backgrounds, many of whom are at higher risk of experiencing violence. An additional $26 million will be spent to improve support services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, including $17 million for Family Violence Prevention Legal Services programs. There will be $29.3 million to support refugee and migrant women's safety, and socially and economically inclusive communities, as well as an additional $10.3 million to extend for an extra year the new pilot program supporting women on temporary visas experiencing family violence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The disability royal commission has highlighted the tragedy that women with disability experience higher levels of all forms of violence, and the government will provide a further $9.3 million over three years to develop resources that aim to reduce violence against women and girls with disability, and to improve service responses when violence occurs. Many of us can recognise the heartbreak of these issues. But to truly understand the challenges we face and the way forward, we need strong and accurate data that captures the diversity of experiences, that has never been more apparent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is investing $48.9 million to bolster comprehensive data collection and research, which includes ongoing funding for two of the most important sources of national data on violence against women—the Personal Safety Survey and the National Community Attitudes towards Violence against Women Survey. In addition $31.6 million will be invested over five years to the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Personal Safety Survey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is steadfast in its commitment to improve the services and outcomes for safety for women and children. And I know I'm joined by all members of this place who stand with me in that resolution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rebuilding a strong Australian economy will lay the foundation for women's workforce participation and economic security. The measures in the Women's Budget Statement provide targeted support to increase women's work choices and address barriers in the paid workforce, and to help ensure that women can build a financially secure future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The childcare investment alone will add up to 300,000 hours of work per week, allowing mothers, fathers and carers, up to 40,000 people to work an extra day a week and boosting GDP by up to $1.5 billion a year. In addition, the government is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">providing support and services for women commencing in a non-traditional trade occupation</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">extending eligibility for digital skills training places and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">boosting the next generation of women in STEM.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone should feel safe at work. Everyone is entitled to respect in the workplace. There is additional funding to support the implementation of our response to the Respect@Work report. The government is committed to building a new culture of respect in Australian workplaces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To support more women into a greater range of industries and occupations, the government is investing an additional $12.2 million for the National Careers Institute Partnership Grants program to support projects that facilitate more career opportunities and supported career pathways for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that women make up the majority of the workforce in sectors dedicated to the care of our most vulnerable, often at the front line of the services we all depend on, and we are grateful for the contributions they make every day. We are funding retention bonuses for registered nurses in the aged-care sector and continuing training. We are providing funding to support informal carers of older Australians, including through increased access to respite services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that many women, particularly those in later stages of life, can find themselves suddenly financially vulnerable. It can stem from family breakdown, poor superannuation outcomes at retirement or a continued need for financial dependence that comes from being on the wrong side of a gender pay gap throughout your career. The Morrison government is focused on improving retirement outcomes for women and will remove the $450-per-month threshold under which employees are not paid the superannuation guarantee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Divorce and family separation should not mean lifelong economic sacrifices and insecurity for women and their children. The government is also investing $10.7 million to streamline the process for distributing property after separation or divorce, and to provide access to lawyers to assist with mediation for property distribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stable housing is another important underpinning of women's economic security and wellbeing. Recognising this, the government is establishing the family home guarantee to assist eligible single parents with dependent children—the vast majority of whom are women—to enter or re-enter the housing market sooner with a deposit of as little as two per cent of the purchase price.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't be what you can't see. Women leaders—and seeing women leading—shows other women what we can achieve, and more importantly what society can achieve where decision-making is equitably shared between women and men of diverse skills and talents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With women's leadership comes respect for women in the workplace, the belief among women and men that positive change can and will happen, and generations hereafter of Australian girls and boys growing up in a country where gender equality is insisted on and embraced. That's why we are investing $38.3 million into expanding the highly successful Women's Leadership and Development Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport is a fundamental part of Australian life and women have much to contribute as players, leaders and role models. Watching Ash Barty take her place as world No. 1, Sam Kerr literally kick goals and the AFLW and Women's Rugby League grow in support is as exciting as it is inspiring. We are investing $17 million to support world-class sporting events over coming years including eight additional Matildas international matches and the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup. Initiatives like this not only provide us with goals for young women to aspire to but create a pipeline of employment and leadership and mentoring for women and girls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The health of Australian women and girls is critical to their social and economic wellbeing. Maternal, sexual and reproductive health is a key priority area for Australia's Long Term National Health Plan. Chronic, preventative and mental health concerns can disproportionately affect women. In recognition of this, the Women's Budget Statement includes investment in breast screening as well as funding for accessible outreach services for women with breast cancer, including in regional and remote areas; cervical screening; funding for work on reducing the rate of preterm births; and legal and mental health supports for women experiencing family violence in regional and remote communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Improving postnatal care for mothers, families and babies is imperative. We're building on the national perinatal mental health check initiative to achieve universal screening across public antenatal and postnatal care settings. Ante- and postnatal depression are in many ways still being understood but every mother on their journey to motherhood deserves to be heard. So many families have been touched by postnatal depression, and I know that mothers reflecting on their own experiences understand the importance with which universal screenings and informed natal mental health care are needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure that Australian women have access to life-saving medicines and essential services, the government is investing in new and amended PBS listings, including $19 million for the listing of Oripro to prevent women going into premature labour. These measures complement the government's overall investment in health for the Australian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Women's Budget Statement is for all Australian women and girls. I stand here today as a member of the Morrison government and a member of the cabinet women's task force, but it is all women of this place, on this side and the other side, who are helping to drive this agenda. Our voices are being heard in here but for the women outside of this place, we stand here for you. For those of you who are disenfranchised, for those who feel they are suffering in silence, to victim-survivors, to advocates, to young women starting their education or career journeys, for all the women who are empowered and those who are being heard, for the women in our cities, women in our regions and for the women on their traditional country—to all women: we are listening and we are acting. I commend the Women's Budget Statement to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  I begin by welcoming the decision to restore the Women's Budget Statement this year. Bob Hawke introduced the Women's Budget Statement in 1984, driven by the marvellous Susan Ryan, who we lost too young. At that time, it was a world first and for decades after it was a proud local tradition; until, of course, Tony Abbott abolished it in 2014. After eight years, this statement is an admission that government policy can affect men and women differently and that, unless we measure these things, unless we pay attention to them, women inevitably fall behind. Tony Abbott knew that, I assume. He was the minister for women, after all. That's why he abolished the Women's Budget Statement in the first place. Since then, it's no surprise that this government has been failing the interests of Australian women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year has forced us to a reckoning with some of those failures. It's put a face to our problems—the brave face of young women who refuse to accept silence and who insist on demanding something better from us as their representatives: justice, respect and an equal voice at the decision-making table. That's what women are asking for, whatever their politics. Yet, we still live in a country where women are paid less than men for their work, where too many retire into poverty, where families can't afford child care and where violence is a terrible fact of life. I think what our discussions before the break told us, if anything, is that every woman has a story of sexual harassment, sexual violence or domestic violence—every single woman in this country has a story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Insofar as there are policies in this budget which acknowledge these problems, we welcome them. There are a number of things here that we have called for and we support unequivocally. We welcome them and we hope that they have been designed and delivered in good faith. We hope that they're free of the suspicions and ideology that stopped the government taking these issues seriously for the past eight years. But you can understand why some Australian women are struggling to believe this Prime Minister's promises. They're looking at his record and assuming that this is just another political fix, because the government's record on women's policy does not inspire confidence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the Liberal Party came to office, childcare costs have risen by a third. Nine hundred and forty thousand women have been forced to raid their superannuation accounts to survive the pandemic. A million women are looking for work. In fact, Australia has plummeted 26 spots down the international rankings for gender equality. We are now 50th in the world for gender equality. That is the lowest we have been since these records have been kept. It's only now, minutes to an election, after the Prime Minister has so profoundly lost the faith of Australian women, that these promises come. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister has never had trouble making promises. It's keeping promises that he struggles with. Already the details in this budget don't match the sunny promises he's given us. When you read these documents you see that the budget forecasts a drop in the number of Australian women in the workforce. It forecasts a pay cut for Australian women and a tax hike after the next election. You have always got to check the fine print with this guy, because, beyond the hype and beyond headlines, it's just not clear that any of these promises will actually be delivered. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite now say that they're going to implement the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, which we all know was sitting on the then Attorney-General's desk, gathering dust, for more than a year. And you think, 'Oh, well, better late than never.' Again, you hear the headline, 'We're accepting all the recommendations,' but when you read the fine print it's very far from the case. You learn, in fact, that the government is refusing to deliver on the most urgent changes recommended by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. There's a pattern here, and they can't shake it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Labor welcomes any additional funding for women's safety. We do. We welcome additional funding for women's safety, because wherever I go in this country, from Launceston to Newcastle to Rockhampton, what women's services tell me is that things have never been harder—literally, never been harder. It has never been harder to house women and their children trying to flee domestic violence. It has never been harder to get them the legal assistance that they need. Why is this only happening now, eight years in?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After almost a decade of reports, inquiries and royal commissions, with hundreds of recommendations ignored, why is it coming just weeks after the Family Court was abolished? We all know how important it is for people making decisions during family breakdowns to have a specialist understanding of the dynamics of domestic violence, something that the Family Court had. The Family Court's abolition was not wanted by anybody working in the area. Specialised family courts run by people that understand the dynamics of domestic violence are absolutely critical to keeping women and children safe. That's what all the evidence tells us. You look at decisions like this and it is a bit hard to take the Prime Minister's promises seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is more than just the policies and the gap between announcement and delivery. Over the last couple of days, the Prime Minister and those opposite have been asked to vote on the member for Bowman and his fitness to hold high office. At every opportunity they've had to put their votes where their rhetoric has been on keeping people safe and on, as the minister said, preventing the use of the internet to stalk and harass people and for coercive control and to call out this behaviour and stand against it, what have they done? They have voted to protect this guy, a taxpayer funded troll. They voted to protect an extra 22,000 bucks for him to keep his committee position. It is a bit hard on the one hand to say you want to take strong action and then on the other hand the minute you have the opportunity to take strong action and call it out to instead actually defend this guy. The guy has been caught upskirting a constituent! Honestly, what do you have to do to lose the faith of those opposite? You just have to shake your head, really, when you think about it, don't you? You just want to shake your head. What does it take? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope those opposite reconsider that, because, like I say, there are measures in this budget that we are very happy to support. But do they not understand that this sends the most mixed of messages to the women of Australia to say that it matters, that this stuff is important, but be prepared to defend a guy who is stalking, threatening, harassing and upskirting his own constituents?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to say that, as Labor's shadow minister for women, I get what it is that we need to achieve for Australian women. But actually what's even more important is that we have a leader in the member for Grayndler who understands, a shadow ministry that understands and a caucus that understands. Having a critical mass of women in the parliament on our side changes things so profoundly. When I came into this place, we were about a quarter female on this side of the parliament. We now are close to half. It is such a profound difference not to have to explain from scratch every time one of these changes needs to be made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a policy agenda ready to go from day one. Our childcare policy would make child care cheaper for 97 per cent of Australian families. Three-quarters of those who would benefit from Labor's policy will not benefit from the policy announced by those opposite—a million families with more affordable child care. Imagine what that would do not just for family budgets but for women's workforce participation and for the national budget. Imagine the difference that would make when we increase the rate of women's workforce participation. But we don't need to imagine it. We know that this would unleash billions of dollars of national wealth. We know, too, that Labor is committed to pay equity. We would strengthen the Fair Work Commission's ability to order pay rises for low-paid, female dominated industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So much has been said, quite rightly, over the last few days about the importance of getting the workforce right in aged care. We absolutely need to invest more in supporting people to choose aged care as a career and supporting them to stay in the career. That means paying decent wages. How can it be okay that you can earn more stacking shelves at Woolies than by caring for our oldest and most vulnerable Australians, or our youngest and most vulnerable Australians? It's just not right. We need the Fair Work Commission to be able to order pay rises for low-paid female dominated industries. We also need to give greater job security to casuals and gig workers, as our policy does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On superannuation, we're committed to getting to the full 12 per cent, because we know that too many Australian women are retiring into poverty. The fastest-growing group of people moving into homelessness is single older women. On women's safety, of course we know that if you're working and you're trying to leave a violent relationship that you need that 10 days of paid domestic violence leave which Labor has committed to. That's to go to court, to give police statements, to change the locks, to get the kids sorted at school and to attend counselling or to come out of hospital. You need that 10 days of paid domestic violence leave. We don't want women to have to choose between their jobs and staying safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's our promise: at work, in the family and in retirement we have an agenda for women, written by women. It wasn't written to solve a momentary political problem; it's an agenda that you can trust, because, for us, equality will never be an exercise in damage control. It's who we are and it's why our party exists. It's our simplest and our most important belief, that every Australian is born with the same value and with the same rights to safety, happiness and independence. When we fail to meet this standard—when we fall short of equality—it's bad for women but it's bad for men too, because equality is good for women and it's good for men too.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Clarifying International Obligations for Removal) Bill 2021 and the Migration Amendment (Tabling Notice of Certain Character Decisions) Bill 2021. These bills are required to be enacted to address a pressing and very serious concern following some recent Federal Court decisions where it was found that, in effect, the Migration Act presently requires the department to remove a person in immigration detention where they do not hold a visa. The passage of the bills, therefore, is necessary to prevent the refoulement of people to whom Australia has recognised protection obligations. These bills and these decisions raise some important and, indeed, challenging issues, and some questions of balance and proportionality need to be struck.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concern that has given rise to the need for this legislation relates to a cohort of 21 people who are presently in immigration detention who have all been found to be owed protection obligations but who have also failed to meet the criteria for a visa because they do not pass the character test or they have received adverse security assessments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the legislation before the House, having secured from the government some important amendments, including the second bill, the tabling notice of certain character decisions bills, and commitments which ensure that some of the consequential issues that we have been concerned about and stakeholders have raised as well are dealt with in a manner that is proportionate to the substantive and immediate question of preventing non-refoulement and the issues that that raises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe these 21 individuals can't be returned to their country of origin, but they would also present some risks to the community or national security if they were to be released from immigration detention. Of course Australia has non-refoulement obligations under international treaties not to return individuals to situations where they face persecution, a real risk of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary deprivation of life or the application of the death penalty. As I don't need to tell you, Deputy Speaker Georganas, it is difficult to overstate the importance of such obligations. They are quite literally matters of life and death. It's also the case, and under the same international instruments, that Australia is not required to provide a visa to persons who engage protection obligations if there are compelling national security or public order matters that are also engaged. So these individuals prevent a significant challenge in terms of identifying a durable solution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of these court rulings put that into a stark set of circumstances where presently the only option available to the government to avoid refoulement would be to grant people a visa and allow them to stay, even though they fail the character test or have adverse security assessments. This presents us with an invidious and unsatisfactory set of circumstances. It would also be contrary to community expectations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the government has contended the intent of the act was never to permit the refoulement of persons found to be owed protection. The principal bill we are debating now would amend the act to clarify that the Migration Act does not require or authorise removal of a person on character or national security grounds where that person has also been assessed as engaging refugee protection obligations. This is significant and important. The bill also provides additional options to resolve the ongoing detention of people in this cohort, including community detention with bail-like conditions, third-country options and ministerial discretion to determine that protection is no longer owed in circumstances where conditions that gave rise to the protection claim no longer exist. This raises some particular concerns which have been attended to since the bill was initially introduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should also be noted that the provisions in the bill could also impact other individuals in the future who are held in immigration detention in Australia who engage refugee protection obligations, but only if they fail to satisfy the adverse character security assessment criteria for a visa. This is a real concern, but we must always remember that if this bill does not pass then people who are owed protection by us may be returned to countries where they face persecution. If the bill doesn't pass such people may be returned to a country to face persecution and perhaps death.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am aware that my colleagues, the shadow minister for home affairs and the shadow Attorney-General, received some briefings from national security agencies in relation to the cohort directly affected by the legislation. I put on the record Labor's appreciation for the provision of these briefings, which has helped us in our consideration of the bill and the matters connected to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will turn, briefly, to the concerns that we have expressed about the bill and how they have been addressed. From the outset, Labor has recognised that there are real concerns that the bill, including the new ministerial discretion, must be limited and exercised narrowly and appropriately, given the consequences at issue here. The powers to reassess protection obligations are significant and, as such, appropriate safeguards on the use of such a power are required. We welcome the minister's determination that where protection obligations are no longer engaged for a person this is to be subject to merits review. Given the significance of this power and the impact it may have on an individual, the right to merits review, not simply judicial review, is a very important, indeed a vital, safeguard in the circumstances. I recognise the government's agreement to this amendment as something that is very significant in our consideration of these matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also note that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security will hold a statutory review of the bill's operation within 24 months of royal assent. Given the urgent requirement for the passage of the legislation, and the limited time for the committee's consideration, a request has been made for the PJCIS to undertake a statutory review of the amendments, and, indeed, their operation, within 24 months of royal assent. I note the government has agreed to this measure which will provide an appropriate opportunity to consider the impact of the amendments and the long-term detention impacts on the cohort, as well as to explore alternatives to indefinite detention—a matter of great concern to all of us on this side of the House, and to many in the community. As I said earlier, the matters before the House are complex, challenging and require a proportionate balancing of considerations. In the circumstances, this is an important consideration that will require ongoing review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also agreed to tabling measures which are implemented through the Migration Amendment (Tabling Notice of Certain Character Decisions) Bill 2021. This will provide that the minister will now be required to table a statement in the parliament within 15 days when the visa of a person to whom protection obligations are owed is cancelled, but where the cancellation does not meet some of the mandatory cancellation provisions in the Migration Act or be the subject of a national security assessment. The statement for tabling will be modelled on the existing regime that applies to intervention cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also the case that the minister will provide assurances that the legislation only has implications for the small cohort of detainees who enliven Australia's non-refoulement obligations. Labor has been assured, including through the explanatory memorandum, that this is the intent of the government. Labor has also sought, and received, assurances from the government that this cohort receives ombudsman assessment under section 486O of the act and that the ombudsman requires an assessment of the appropriateness in the arrangements of detention for every person who has been in immigration detention for more than two years, and every six months thereafter, with a copy of this to be tabled in the parliament. These reports are also an important oversight measure for immigration detention, along with the other powers of the ombudsman, including investigating complaints, own-motion investigations and inspections of immigration detention facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge the minister and his office for the way in which they have worked constructively through the issues that we have raised with them, and enabled this matter and the issues that we have brought forward to be resolved in a manner that we regard as satisfactory. Now, these provisions aren't necessarily the way in which Labor might have approached these issues, but we recognise they are a response to a very real issue with very real impact on people's lives, and, indeed, on Australia's international obligations. The choice here is quite stark. We must act if we are to prevent refoulement. We will continue to pay close attention to the operation of these provisions and the issues that have given rise to them, but we support the bills in the context I have outlined.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="MT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  It's a pleasure to stand where a lot of consideration has been given to a bill by both parties—and at length, clearly. What I would just like to point out, though, is many members of the public do not understand the concept of refoulement and how it works. I'd like to explain it in the member for Monash's way, Russell Broadbent's way. If someone has entered this country and overstayed their visa for whatever reason and they don't have authority, a personal authority, to be in the country, then we have an obligation to look after our—I'm not saying our borders, but the regime that protects the citizenship of a nation. This has been fairly controversial lately, but let's go to this issue rather than other issues. And so if somebody has put themselves in a position where they are not capable of staying in this country, they don't have a legal right to be in the country—this happens no matter who is in government—then we have options to give them some other due consideration. It might be by the minister. It might be through the courts. They are options that we can give. Australia gives people more options than any other country in the world to identify themselves as somebody who has a right to stay. We really do. We go out of our way. But, if for some reason, we have not been in the right place at the right time, we do not understand their considerations or we have misunderstood the reasons for their being here in Australia, they have many options to go through before we say, 'No, you have to leave the country.' In that process, we say that we do not allow people in refoulement—that is, by deporting you from this country, we would put you in a place of your peril, of your physical danger or of your rights of activity in another country that may be absolutely and totally inappropriate under our national values here in Australia—that someone would be under severe threat of prosecution or death, or of imprisonment, for that matter—it depends—if they were returned to their own country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have a regime. In some cases, when people are going through the courts or through other processes, we have a regime of detention. It's already here in Australia. As the world knows, I, the member for Monash, do not like indefinite detention in this country. I'll say that to anybody. I'll keep on saying it wherever I can. A nation needs to have the heart, the soul and the spirit to say that this is not how we treat people in this country. However, this is not the time to go there and say what I think about that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a bill before us. I should say that the Liberal and National parties and the opposition parties—the Labor Party, the Greens and the Independents—take these issues really seriously, because they are people's lives we are dealing with. These are decisions we're making about people's lives. We all take them very seriously. However, if you have fouled your own nest in this country or done the wrong thing—people often forget that it's not only about the people who do not have a legal right to be here. We have to protect our own community from people who perhaps should not be here. If it's found that they shouldn't be in this country, they should be sent back to their own country. The government takes its international obligations really seriously in these matters, because we want to keep our reputation as a nation that treats people fairly in every instance possible—fairly under our law, fairly under our mutual obligations to each other and fairly under our international obligations in the treaties that we, as a nation, have signed up to and said that we will abide by. Refoulement comes into that area. We are not going to send people into refoulement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, this is rather technical, as it was described by the shadow minister. Australia takes its international obligations very seriously and has a longstanding policy of not forcibly removing an unlawful noncitizen in breach of Australia's non-refoulement obligations. We won't do it. Where there have been changes in legislation or proposed changes from courts' rulings, the government, on behalf of the people of Australia, have to act. A recent judgement by a single judge of the Federal Court has altered the operation of section 197C of the Migration Act in a manner which is inconsistent with the intention of the Parliament of Australia. What have we got here? We've got a clash between the courts and the intention of the parliament in these matters. The parliament is now resolving to move this legislation so that the issue of certain persons of faith will not come before this, because we are doing these things. How did this come about? Obviously, it was raised with the opposition and there were some considerations made. We sat down, the opposition and the government, negotiated as to how we would resolve this matter and came to an agreement, which has formed this legislation. If I'm incorrect, please tell me now, but that is what you have done. The legislation has been put before the opposition, and they have worked through it piece by piece by piece. But then they put in place a couple of things that have been described to me just today. First, in 12 months time we are going to look at how this is working; is that correct?</span>

The legislation is here, but, as part of its consideration, the government has agreed that in two years time we will see how this is working and see if it is effectual in the manner that the legislation has been described. More importantly, there was another point which you raised. Can you tell me what that one was, too, please?</span>

                    </a>  I'm sorry; I'm just looking for a signal from the other side as to what the agreement was. It was probably written down in a speech that was not memorable. Given the serious consequences associated with the Federal Court judgement, the government has responded decisively by appealing the judgement in the High Court. So we have gone into the courts to talk to the people. Secondly, we have introduced this bill to restore section 197C to its intended purpose. This bill was introduced last sitting week and the government intends to pass it this week, so there is some urgency about the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we have a detention regime, but this bill is not designed to create a new framework for immigration detention. We already have one. The amendments in this bill are designed to ensure that detainees are not required to be removed in breach of Australia's international protection obligations. This is a humanitarian objective which should not, and has not, become a political football. We want to make sure that courts won't order the government to send people back to places where they are expected to face persecution, torture or death.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This may prolong the detention of a handful of serious criminals and people of national security concern. In some cases they are not the best of people, but that's for others to judge, not me. We're not talking here about the general run of the public; we're talking about difficult cases. They are in detention because both Labor and coalition governments have reviewed their cases and truly agonised over the details. Decision-makers have known that an adverse decision would carry a risk of long-term detention, but have decided that the risk to the community is so high that these people cannot be unleashed into the community. It is really difficult for governments to enter into this space. Each case is routinely reviewed by the Department of Home Affairs and subject to independent oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The government amendments to this CIOR bill will require review of the clarifying international obligations for removal within 24 months. The second one will insert AAT merits review rights for determination that a person who previously engaged protection obligations no longer engages those obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will leave it there at this stage. The bill provides greater transparency in relation to the exercise of ministerial power. We are offering greater transparency. We are offering a review in 22 months. We are offering review rights for determinations that a person who previously engaged protection obligations no longer engages those obligations. So there are three overriders here that are protections for the persons involved. At the same time, the government needs to protect the nation that we serve and have an obligation to the broader community. This establishes the previous intention of government in these matters, to hold the intention of the parliament to be fulfilled in this legislation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="ECV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  I would like to make a short contribution in this debate on the Migration Amendment (Clarifying International Obligations for Removal) Bill 2021. Apart from agreeing with the direction of the bill, I would like to say—as I am sure that I have said on many occasions in this place—that my electorate, apart from being very colourful and vibrant, is also one of the largest recipients of refugees in the country. I can't speak for other members here, but I know that, with respect to matters contained in this bill, I have received many, many representations over a number of years both when Labor has been in government as well as when the current Treasury bench has been filled by the other side. It is something that has been a vexed question for everybody.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a genuine humanitarian issue at stake here, and I think there has been goodwill on both sides in trying to reach an outcome where we can not only honour our international obligations in terms of refoulement but also importantly meet the expectations of our communities. Our primary responsibility in this place is to keep our communities safe. So, from the outset, I would certainly indicate, as the shadow minister has, that Labor will be supporting this bill. We believe that, with the necessary amendments and the protections that have been secured, the bill strikes the right balance between Australia's refugee obligations and our obligations with regard to the protection of our communities here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the bill addresses a circumstance in respect of a small cohort of 21 people who are currently in immigration detention, who have been found that we owe refugee protection to but have failed to meet the character test for a visa. Whether they have received adverse security assessments from our respective agencies or, alternatively, a serious crime has been committed, they have, nevertheless, failed that character test. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As was discussed earlier, Australia has a non-refoulement obligation under international treaties, and that is not to return people to a situation where they may face persecution, the real threat of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, arbitrary deprivation of life and, indeed, the death penalty itself. Under the same treaties, Australia is not required to provide a visa to a person who engages refugee protection obligations if there are compelling national security or public order reasons that also come into effect. This is where the courts do get involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These 21 individuals, as I understand, pose a significant challenge in terms of identifying the practical situation for their issue. They have been determined and recognised as being refugees, but there are issues as to why they present a risk if released from immigration detention and into the community. That being the case, if they cannot be returned to their country of origin, as there are still threats of persecution that exist against them et cetera and, as I understand it, they also present a risk to the Australian community because of either criminal or national security issues if they are released, it has presented a question that has taken both sides of this House to work on for a long period of time to get an appropriate but nevertheless humanitarian response to. Interposed with that, the Federal Court rulings have certainly had an impact on this. The court has held that the removal powers of the Migration Act authorises the removal of person that fails to meet that criteria for a visa—that character test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would mean, if that were put into effect, that the government could basically wash its hands of it and say: 'They failed the test. We have no alternative but to send them back to where they came from or where they allege the persecution exists. And where we have been satisfied that a genuine threat exists to them, therefore we have assessed them as being refugees.' That would really be such a hypocritical position for any government to be forced into.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only other alternative that would present itself to the minister would be that they be released into the community. This is a situation of either one or the other; it's not a situation of being able to look at a suitable alternative. The only option would be for the government to grant a person a visa and allow them to stay in Australia, which would fail our test of ensuring the safety of our community. I think that would fail the test of community obligations that we have to keep our people safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Migration Act. To clarify, the act does not require or authorise removal of a person on character or national security grounds where the person has been assessed and found to be owed refugee protection. It also provides an additional option to resolve the ongoing detention of people in this cohort, including community detention—bail-like conditions—a third-country option and, this is the important one, discretion to determine that protection is no longer owed in the circumstances where conditions that gave rise to the protection claim no longer exist. In other words, it allows the government to look at the situation and determine whether the claim for protection is no longer valid against that particular person, and that person then could be returned to their country of origin or the country where they allege the persecution exists. However, if this bill does not pass then people who are owed that protection may certainly be returned to a country where they face persecution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also keeps Australians safe and certainly goes a fair distance to prevent harm to the general community by preventing someone of a threat or of a great risk being released into the community proper. Many stakeholders have voiced considerable concern about the retrospective nature of ministerial discretion in this regard and I have received a lot of correspondence in my office about this. In terms of the reassessment of protection obligations under the bill, this is something new and something that did not exist before. On balance, I think it is quite legitimate and sensible for any government to be able to assess, retrospective or otherwise, to determine the actual nature of a refugee's status. Nevertheless, Labor also recognises that this bill, including the ministerial discretion, must be limited and it must be exercised narrowly. This is the first time we hope it will be exercised other than in rare situations. That is why we have proposed a number of amendments to safeguard the use of this power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments include the making of a ministerial determination subject to a merits review and ensuring that the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security hold a review into the bill's implementation after two years of operation. Labor has also sought assurances from the government that this cohort, the 21 people, receive an ombudsman's assessment in relation to individuals in detention and the appropriateness of their arrangements for detention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Accordingly, the measures proposed in the bill are, I believe, necessary for ensuring Australia's non-refoulement obligations are met while ensuring that the persons who are a risk are not released back into the community. With that said, we on this side believe that, with the necessary amendments and protections that we have been able to secure, this bill strikes an appropriate balance. Therefore, I support the passage of this bill.</span>

                    <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  These bills, the Migration Amendment (Clarifying International Obligations for Removal) Bill 2021 and the Migration Amendment (Tabling Notice of Certain Character Decisions) Bill 2021, are before the House because of a decision of Justice Bromberg of the Federal Court of Australia on 11 September 2020 in a case called AJL20 v the Commonwealth of Australia [2020] FCA 1305. The facts of the case concern a Syrian man who came to Australia as a child in 2005 and had his visa cancelled by the immigration minister on character grounds. He had been imprisoned and served time for criminal offences as a teenager. He was then placed in immigration detention but, rather than returning him to Syria, the Commonwealth did not take steps to return him to Syria. Justice Bromberg, in that case, interpreted section 197C of the Migration Act in a way that is inconsistent with the original intention of the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills before us do two things. First, they clarify the interpretation and the meaning of section 197C of the Migration Act, particularly in relation to the principle of non-refoulement. Non-refoulement is that very important principle at the foundation of migration and refugee law which means that somebody should not be returned to a country where they would face torture, cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment or to a place where they would face persecution, torture or other ill treatment and human rights violations. That's a very important principle of human rights law. It's a very important principle of refugee law. It's a principle which Australia, consistent with our international obligations, abides by.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue that this legislation deals with is the question of character determinations. The minister, in exercising his or her power from time to time to exclude people from Australia on the basis of character grounds, to cancel their visas on the basis of character, exercises a very important set of powers to protect Australia from people who would commit crimes. We're talking about very serious crimes. We are talking about serious assault. We are talking about murder. We are talking about serious violent sexual crimes. We're talking about very serious crimes for which the character determination is often exercised by the minister. We are talking also about threats to national security, as we do from time to time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular legislation provides greater transparency and oversight of the minister's determinations on character matters than we have previously had in the migration system. It amends the minister's discretionary national interest cancellation and refusal powers under 501(3) to insert a requirement to table notice that the power has been exercised except in cases involving significant criminal offending or national security concerns. Thereby, because of that tabling requirement, other than in those exceptional cases, this legislation actually provides greater transparency for the minister's exercise of that very important character determination power under 501 of the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought I would say something about 197C and its purpose and why we have this legislation before us today. Section 197C was designed to deter last-minute court injunctions by unlawful citizens who sought to prevent their removal by making what are effectively vexatious claims that the removal would be in breach of Australia's non-refoulement obligations, despite these individuals having been already found not to actually engage those obligations. But it was never intended that section 197C would require a person to be removed from Australia in breach of non-refoulement obligations. That's the issue with the interpretation that Justice Bromberg has put on the law in the case of AJL20. It's for that reason that this legislation is before us today. Given the serious consequences associated with this Federal Court judgement, the government's responded decisively—firstly, by appealing the case to the High Court and, secondly, by introducing this legislation. These bills were introduced in the last sitting week and the government is hoping to pass them this week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments are designed to ensure that detainees are not required to be removed in breach of Australia's international protection obligations. We want to make sure that courts understand they shouldn't order the government to send people back to places where they are expected to face persecution, torture or death. This may prolong the detention of a handful of serious criminals and people of national security concern. Decision-makers who make these decisions under the character determination understand that the decisions they're making carry that risk but that the risk of the person to the community is so high that these people cannot be unleashed into the community more broadly. Each case is routinely reviewed by the department and subject to independent oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. These are sensible and not controversial amendments, and I commend them to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  I will not attempt to stand in the way of the Migration Amendment (Clarifying International Obligations for Removal) Bill 2021; I certainly won't be calling a division. But I would like to take this opportunity to voice some concerns that I do have with the bill, and I think I speak for many Australians who would share these views. First and foremost I disagree in principle with the whole idea of what would amount to indefinite mandatory detention, and in extreme circumstances that's what this bill would allow—that someone who has had their visa cancelled and for whatever reason is unable to be returned to their country of origin could be held in immigration detention for the rest of their days. I do want to put on the public record that I strongly disagree with that as a matter of principle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also disagree with the whole notion of disrespecting the rulings and the intent of the Federal Court. I think it is poor practice that whenever the Federal Court rules against the government, the government just keeps changing the law until it finds a workaround for the Federal Court. I also disagree strongly in principle with the idea of retrospectivity. Retrospectivity, clearly, as a matter of high principle, should be avoided at all costs and only be used in the most extreme of circumstances. Of course, indefinite mandatory detention is at odds with numerous international agreements that this country has signed up to in good faith. One of those international agreements, which I often refer to in this place, and will again, is the Rome Statute, where it is explicitly detailed that it is a crime against humanity to hold anyone in detention indefinitely. That of course, as I've remarked already, would be allowed for under this bill if it should become law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is also an unreasonable extension of the power of the state. Over the last 20 years or so, there have been countless laws made in this place when it comes to immigration and immigration detention. Probably the most dramatic and memorable of those laws was the excision of Australian offshore territories and islands from our migration zone. To this day, I think it was the most bizarre—and it would be laughable if it wasn't so wrong—decision made in this place some years ago. I remember a cartoon in one of the newspapers, where it had the immigration minister at the time standing next to Uluru, saying: 'They touched the rock. They can stay.' It was funny in some ways, but very, very sad, and very, very true in other ways, as far as the point it was making. I take this opportunity, in talking about the overreach of the power of the state, to say that it has to do with not just immigration matters but so many other matters, most obviously national security, where almost 100 different laws have been made by this parliament since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, many of which have been quite unnecessary and are very worrying extensions of the power of the state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not like we don't have alternatives to what we're about to decide upon in this place. As recently as February this year I introduced into the parliament a private member's bill, the Ending Indefinite and Arbitrary Immigration Detention Bill 2021, which received no support from the government, nor from the alternative government. I take this opportunity to remind honourable members of that bill, because it just goes to show that there are viable alternatives to the way we detain people in this country. That bill, if it were ever to become law, would abolish unlawful mandatory detention of asylum seekers, refugees and noncitizens. By the way, in doing so, it would have the effect of ending offshore detention. I do note that in last night's budget even more money is being thrown at increasing the capacity of the Christmas Island detention facility. How many billions of dollars after billions of dollars is this country going to throw at offshore detention before we realise we have to find better and more humane—and lawful, in international law—ways of dealing with irregular immigration?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides that community alternatives to immigration detention will always be preferred to detention behind wire and bars. The bill ensures that those in alternatives to immigration detention have full access to housing and financial support and have the right to work and the right to education, health care and other government services, as required under international law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that I introduced earlier this year, the alternative to what we're talking about tonight in many cases, includes specific conditions on how and why a person can be detained. It disallows long-term and arbitrary detention by setting limited time frames to ensure that an individual's detention period is as short as possible. The bill would remove the abhorrent and torturous conditions that detainees currently experience by ensuring their access to information and services. Importantly, every decision under my bill, the alternative to tonight's in many cases, would allow every decision to be subject to independent oversight and prompt review and not to be at the whim of the minister of the day. Sure, the ministers of the day will often be fine people who make sound decisions, but we should never have in place laws that would allow some ministers to act improperly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that I'm referring to is urgently needed. I think that in coming in here and debating what we're debating tonight—a bill that under Australian law would legalise indefinite arbitrary detention—we see again very, very clearly how important alternatives are, and we should be coming in here and debating them. I can't believe that the government has not even allowed the debate of my bill, which would provide an alternative to arbitrary indefinite detention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that arbitrary immigration detention, as practised in this country and as legalised tonight, is immoral and illegal under international law. It is immoral, in that we have a moral obligation to give people protection, to hear their claims and to give them refuge if their claims are accurate. If someone is found to be a refugee, we should give them permanent refuge in this country and access to all of the services and opportunities that are enjoyed by the rest of us. It is illegal to have indefinite mandatory detention, because it's in contravention of numerous international agreements. Sure, tonight we might legalise something in this country under Australian law, but in doing so we will be at odds with so many international agreements that the members of this House in years gone by have debated, scrutinised, signed and ratified in good faith—agreements like, obviously, the refugee convention; the refugee protocol; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women; the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; and, of course, the Rome Statute, which I've already referred to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll close there. I've made my point. I'm talking not just to matters of international law but also to matters of high principle. It is wrong in principle to be prepared to legalise the detention of people—and to legalise and go ahead and detain people—in this country indefinitely, arbitrarily and without trial. To be fair to the government, yes, genuine efforts to safeguard against people being sent back to harm should be welcomed. That point has been made by other contributors to the debate tonight. But such safeguards must be part of changes to stop people languishing in indefinite detention. This bill is targeted at giving the government more power to detain refugees and hold them in detention indefinitely. That's the bottom line. Indeed, this bill will make the current trend of long-term warehousing of refugees in detention even worse.</span>

                    <a href="HWO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  I want to thank all members for their contributions to this debate on both the Migration Amendment (Clarifying International Obligations for Removal) Bill 2021 and the subsequent Migration Amendment (Tabling Notice of Certain Character Decisions) Bill 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the opposition, of course, and other members who have constructively engaged on the nature of this bill and the amendments that I'll subsequently be moving to the bill. This has been a good process to ensure that there is transparency in our Migration Act and in this very vexed area of international obligation versus criminal cancellations and the implications for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say to the members who have made contributions that we've had some obviously profound experience from people like the members for Fowler, Monash and Clark—people who have taken a long-term interest in these matters. On balance, the contributions have shown that there is an acceptance that this is a needed and necessary amendment to the Migration Act, and that isn't always obvious in this parliament. It's good to see that people on all sides have reached the same conclusion about our international obligations and the non-refoulment of people who we owe protection to, and the balance of ensuring that the Australian community is safe where we have criminal cancellations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say to the member for Clark that there are two things I would disagree with in his contribution. The bill in no way is retrospective, and I can say that confidently to the House: it doesn't operate retrospectively. We're doing this because, as he points out, there are a series of court decisions, the interaction with the Migration Act and the consequences. I can absolutely say to him that, if we were to follow the intended outcome of those court decisions, Australia would be in breach of its international obligations by being forced to refoul people. That's why we're here. I know he doesn't agree with that; I know he doesn't support that, and he didn't say that. But we have to have these amendments because of this serious sequence of events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a small cohort of people who we do owe protection to who are also serious criminals. They have been convicted—not arbitrarily and not detained, but they have served serious criminal sentences and are the subject of adverse security assessments by our agencies or, objectively, they pose an ongoing risk to the community and any fair minded member of this parliament would come to that conclusion about this small cohort of people. In this situation, indefinite detention can arise. Obviously, sometimes it does, because we can't refoul them in breach of our international obligations—and no-one here would call for that—but we may not be able to release them. It is a difficult situation in all regards. The government will continue to look at its options in relation to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, circumstances can change in countries. Countries change their situations regularly over years: safety can be re-established, order can be re-established and protection obligations can be revisited from time to time. Or the risk posed to the community can change over time as well. There's regular assessment of those matters and, hopefully, a resolution can be found. But, of course, difficult and complex situations will arise in a small number of cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the parliament can have confidence that both the opposition and the government have carefully considered the matter and understand this to apply to a small cohort. With the amendments that I will be moving under the discretionary national interest cancellation and refusal power under 501(3), the parliament will get notice, obviously, that the power has been exercised, except in cases involving significant criminal offending or national security concerns. That means the government and the parliament will be committed to increased transparency in relation to the operation of these provisions, which should satisfy the parliament, the courts and the public that we are doing the right thing in relation to protecting the community and exercising our international obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that it's a grave topic. I acknowledge the concerns of the member for Clark, but the government takes these concerns very seriously and I believe the opposition has taken these concerns very seriously on both elements in this case. We worked together to ensure that we have a strong law and that the operation of the law will continue both to give effect to our international commitments and to protect the Australian community. We can do both by the proper operation of the law. I want to provide that confidence to the member for Clark and to any other concerned members that these bills do nothing other than provide that certainty to the government, the community and the parliament about the operation of our character cancellations with our international obligations of non-refoulement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without further ado, I commend these provisions. I thank all members for their thoughtful contributions and I thank the opposition for its support for these bills. It is a good example of the parliament coming together.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have moved the government amendments to the Migration Amendment (Clarifying International Obligations for Removal) Bill 2021 as circulated, and I propose an amendment to the Intelligence Services Act 2001 which will require the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to commence a review of the operation, effectiveness and implications of the amendments made by this bill two years after commencement. This review will further ensure that the amendments are effective in preventing a person from being removed from Australia in breach of non-refoulement obligations and in ensuring that protection claims are always assessed in a protection visa application. The amendments will also enable access to merits review for certain individuals who were previously determined to have engaged protection obligations but in respect of whom the minister has decided that they no longer engage those obligations.</span>

A person will not be subject to removal unless the decision is affirmed on merits review, or the period within which the person may apply for merits review has ended without an application for review having been made, or the person has withdrawn the application for the merits review. I commend the amendments to the chamber.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  The Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Assistance and Other Measures) Bill 2021, in its primary form, is really a tidying up of some loose ends around the support for isolated children and people who receive support under Abstudy. It goes to the heart of the requirement to provide tax file numbers. Sometimes, when incomes are not important for that part of the grant, the Commonwealth doesn't need to know those tax file numbers. The other case, of course, is where younger people are involved who are not entitled to a tax file number. In fact, I met with the Isolated Children's Parents Association in my office today. We discussed a number of issues and we ticked off on this one as well. This will tidy up some loose accounts which they will be most appreciative of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the record, the block amount in assistance to isolated children is indexed to the CPI and is $11,011 per annum. Of that, $8,557 is a grant that comes basically without question. There is a further $2,454 of additional payment, depending on parental income—hence, the need for a tax file number—and the actual boarding costs of the student. These arrangements are roughly similar to the Abstudy payments as well as are the criteria surrounding them. That is where this legislation cuts across those payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Isolated children are also eligible for the district education allowance, and that is significant. There is also the tertiary access payment—and 2021 is its first year of operation—which is the relocation grant for those students who have to relocate to another place and set up some kind of accommodation. That is a one-off $5,000 grant. The criterion there is that you must be 90 minutes or more from your place of education by public transport. The vast majority in the electorate of Grey would qualify for that since the recent extension of Grey towards the city.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The treatment of country students was one of the issues that galvanised me to get involved with politics at a higher level than just supporting my local Liberal Party branch. We wanted our children to access the last three years of secondary education in the city rather than in our small country town, which has a very good school but years 9, 10 and 11 are quite limited in the subjects that are available. My first daughter had her heart set on being a chemical engineer. In those days chemistry was one of the requirements, unsurprisingly, yet chemistry was not on offer at the local school. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I queried the education department about that issue I said, 'She can't do year 12 chemistry there.' They said, 'Yes, we will do it through distance education.' I said, 'That's interesting because you can't do year 11 chemistry there.' They said, 'Year 11 chemistry isn't a prerequisite for year 12.' I thought this system isn't working correctly. It is one of the reasons that I got involved. We got our kids through the education system, but we had no assistance at all from governments at any level, except when the kids went off and did some work and we were able to access independent youth allowance for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I pursued some things through my party's mechanisms, and I had the opportunity to get elected to federal parliament. I came here determined to make life better in this area. That was the 2007 election. The result of that election was that then Prime Minister Rudd's team with the then education minister Julia Gillard actually severed the pathway for independent youth allowance that my children had been able to access. They made it far more difficult for others in a similar situation to access. Essentially, there was no government support to get these students into higher level education in the city. It has been a long battle. I have been here 13 years now and we have incrementally won back what we lost and gone further. Country students are now in a better position when it comes to that kind of support than they have ever been. Having said that, there is still more to do. While they are better supported than in the past and while the percentages of country students accessing tertiary education have risen, so too has the number of city students accessing tertiary education. In fact, the gap, if you like, has widened rather than closed, even though we have got more country students as a percentage of the cohort in tertiary education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an ongoing issue for regional Australia. Most of our industries that actually drive regional Australia now are becoming higher and higher technology. The primary industry in regional Australia is agriculture—and I guess the other one is resources. Both of them require people with higher education to actually access the best information and the best technologies available to provide the right outcome for Australia. So we need our bright kids—and they are bright—to be able to access tertiary education and bring those skills home to the farm and home into our communities to drive our communities to the next level. So we will need to keep campaigning in that space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been some good moves, though, including the government investment over the last few years into the uni level—the spoke level, if you like. You need a driver in local communities, and in some of mine it is the local council. We have three uni hubs established in Grey at the moment. The first at Port Pirie, the second at Port Augusta and the third at Kadina—and I think we've got the opportunity to maybe establish one or two more yet. There isn't a regional university as such in the electorate of Grey but there is a regional campus of UniSA in Whyalla. So that community is probably pretty well serviced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the uni hubs is to provide a space and a bit of assistance for students to tackle distance education in a more friendly and supportive environment than trying to just battle through it on their own at home. The Port Pirie uni hub, which was the first established and is in its third year of operation, now has, I understand, around 120 students, which is pretty good. But it's not just about kids. Sure, kids leave school and they want to do tertiary studies. Many times some of those will be attracted to the idea of going to a major university campus anyway, but others can't for all kinds of reasons. They might be the primary caregiver in their family or they might have other issues that mean that they have to stay at home or feel as though they have to stay at home. So it's provided a real opportunity there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have come to know, and recognise quite well, that education is an ongoing and lifelong pursuit. So people are able to come back and get top-up degrees or get their first degree and actually get a start even though they may have already had a stint in the workforce or they may have already raised a family. There are all kinds of different points within people's lives now where they will seek that higher education. You can imagine that if you have a young family, you are the primary caregiver and you are trying to get to university and then maybe trying to juggle online distance learning at home, the idea of being able to go into a campus where you get a bit of support and where you have a cohort to work with is a far more supportive outcome than previously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this young man—though he probably doesn't like me describing him as young anymore—who I first came across when I was elected as the member for Grey back in 2007. He was the apprentice of the year in Port Augusta. I knew his parents and him—even though he had not come from Port Augusta; he'd come from up the road at Ceduna—and I was so thrilled to be there and see his achievement. He worked a number of jobs and then found himself with a good local business and worked his way up through the system where he was basically the leading hand for a company employing 70 people. He is very, very good at what he does. He came to that uni hub opening in Port Augusta. He said: 'This is just what I've been looking for. I was terrible at school. I left at the end of year 10, and my parents, my teachers and I were all in agreement that it would be a good thing.' He said: 'I wasn't applying myself then but I have now. I realise now that, if I want to go to the next level, I'm going to have to get some tertiary education.' He said, 'This will be perfect for me'. He has since graduated and he has got his ticket and he is moving on to a different part of the world. That's a real celebration of what those uni hub arrangements can do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So things have changed. Things are far better than when I got here in 2007. We went backwards, but I don't think it was intended. I don't think Minister Gillard, who was education minister at the time, intended to do damage, but she did, and we had to reconstruct the independent youth allowance criteria to make it work in a better way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing we did in that area was remove the family farm from the assets test. Many have spoken in this place before about family farms being worth a lot of money on paper but sometimes not producing a lot of income. I think it's quite right and proper that the income tests remain, because, if you're making money, you're making money, and, if you're not, you're not. That's quite simple, and I'm very happy to repeat that premise. But, certainly, removing the assets test has allowed more students to access that independent pathway than would have otherwise been the case, and that is a good outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Generally speaking, I've been pleased with the government's action in the area of trying to address the imbalance with the country. I think we've got more to do, and I think we're going to have to keep applying ourselves. Let's hope that there are some more regional universities established in Australia over time. But, as I said at the start, this particular piece of legislation tidies up some loose ends and makes it a little easier for some people to get on with their lives, so I support it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="133646" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MURPHY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  As with my other colleague in the House, I support the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Assistance and Other Measures) Bill 2021. But I rise today to speak predominantly to the second reading amendment and particularly to the part of the second reading amendment that notes that 'the government has made it more expensive for Australian students to undertake tertiary study, and has pushed students into taking on more debt'. That is a shame across Australia and it is a huge shame in my electorate of Dunkley, where there are many young people from hardworking families who are earning the minimum wage, or slightly above, whose aspiration is to go to university, to study commerce, to study the arts, to study law, to do degrees that help them to have careers that help others, and they can't imagine leaving university with something like a $50,000 debt or how they could possibly go on with their adult lives with that on their shoulders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that this is an issue that has been raised by many people in this chamber, and it's an obvious intellectual issue that you can imagine when you think about young people from families that don't have much money. I don't have to imagine it because I've had parents and students coming into my office and telling me about their genuine concerns about how the government's approach to universities and fees is going to impact their futures. I had a mother from Seaford write to me about the fact that her son, who is currently studying second-year law, and her daughter, who's in year 12 and wants to study law, are going to leave university with massively disparate debts. Her son is likely to get a job that, even at the entry-level graduate position, will earn him more money than her daughter because, despite all the laws and despite what everyone may say, it is still the case that, at the entry level, men and women are paid differently for the same job. Her concern is that her daughter is going to leave university with a much higher debt than her son. Her son is most probably going to start earning more money than her daughter. Her son, unless he chooses to, is never going to have to put a pause on his career to look after a baby. He will certainly never have to take time off to give birth. Her daughter will have to. She says to me: 'This is the part of gender inequality that this government doesn't get. I've got two children who I've brought up exactly the same, who have the same values, who have the same aspirations for employment, yet who are genuinely looking at careers and earnings in retirement that are significantly different because of structural inequalities and structural barriers in the system which this government is not fixing, but, indeed, is making worse with the changes to university fees.' So that's one of the consequences of the government making it more expensive for Australian students to undertake tertiary studies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other consequence is this attempt to skew students to study particular subjects at university. We all want our young people to get jobs of the future. We know that STEM is vitally important, and we all want people to go to university and study in a way that will help them with their future careers. But my concern is that only one half of this chamber also wants Australians to be great thinkers, to be innovative thinkers, to be challenging thinkers, and to go to university and become enriched with the history of Greece and Italy and the Indonesian archipelago, for the reason that that sort of learning matters. It might not immediately put you into a STEM job or what is known as a job of the future, but it helps us as a country to be smart, to challenge stereotypes and to learn from history so that we make a better future. It appears that that is what this government wants to stop. It wants to stop critical thinking, or at least critical thinking that doesn't agree with its own ideology, with the way that it's made university fees more expensive. That's a shame for the future of our country. And that's what's missing from this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're here in budget week. There has been a lot of money spent and a lot of analysis of the budget, and there will continue to be a lot of analysis of the budget—what's in it, what's not in it, who the winners are, who the losers are, what's an announcement without delivery, what's new money and what's old money. All of that is important. But you know what is missing from the budget? You know what was missing from the Treasurer's speech and media appearances and from the Prime Minister's speeches? A genuine vision for this country—a genuine vision for the sort of country that this government wants to steer us towards; a genuine vision for when we skill up Australians, when we get our young people into TAFE or university or apprenticeships, and how that contributes to the sort of world-leading nation we want to be. There is no vision about how we can harness the challenge of climate change to have new industries and new jobs, to not only save the planet but also engage that enthusiasm and passion and fierce fighting spirit that young people all over Australia have about the future in building a better one. We'll beat and meet our emissions targets, but that's it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what's missing this week from the Morrison government, and its approach to universities underwrites that. There's no vision in a government that has abandoned university students and universities in their time of need. We know that as at January this year more than 17,000 people had lost their jobs at universities across Australia since the beginning of the pandemic. More than 17,000 people had lost their jobs. They weren't jobs we heard much about in the budget speeches. Universities Australia forecast further cuts this year. Thirteen per cent of the pre-COVID workforce has been lost from universities. That's lecturers, tutors, academics and some administrators, but it's also cleaners, people who work in the canteens, people who look after the gardens and people who do the maintenance. It's also the economic ecosphere that grows up around universities off campus—the cafes, the pubs, the boutiques, the accommodation. All of that has been affected because this government walked away from universities and continued to change JobKeeper so that universities couldn't get it and are still not thinking about how to support universities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sure, we want universities to do research which can be commercialised—that's great—but we also want universities to support the thinking that comes before and around the research. We also want universities to support the critical thinking that feeds into having a vision for the future. We're not going to have that if we don't have universities, and we're not going to have that if we only have private universities or universities that have to function predominantly in a privatised commercial mode—which is where this government is pushing them—and to rely on foreign students. Now that the foreign students can't come, the government not giving universities any support is another irony. We lose something if we lose that sense of worth of education in being able to think, debate and ponder. We genuinely lose something. I fear that that's why we haven't heard an actual vision from the government this week—because of that lack of valuing and understanding the importance of thinking.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people who are affected are real people. Before I conclude my remarks, I want to give an example. I have this truly amazing young woman volunteering in my office at the moment in Parliament House, Lucy Skelton. She's a first-year student at ANU, studying public policy and other things. She told me today that, if she could basically live in Parliament House, she would, because it's so exciting for her to be here and to be part of all of this. She helped to put together some notes for this speech. Sorry, Lucy, I always ad lib and don't use all the notes that are given to me. One of the things she did was go through the member for Barton's speech to highlight some of the issues and, in the papers she gave me, I think she accidentally gave me part of what she'd marked up. There was a sentence in the member for Barton's speech that said, 'Think about the year 12s, who had a hell of a final year last year with COVID-19,' and Lucy had written on it, 'That's me.' That one sentence resonated with her so much that she wrote on it, 'That's me.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She's lucky enough that she's at university and she's doing all she can to live her dream. I want everyone to have Lucy's opportunities. I want everyone in my electorate to be able to dream Lucy's dreams: to be able to come to parliament and sleep here, if they could—as Lucy puts it—because they're so excited to be here and to be able to study things like public policy and politics because they want to be part of this democracy and the bureaucracy that supports it and everything that makes the world a better place. That's what I want for everyone in my electorate. But they can't have that if they can't afford to go to university, buy the books or pay the accommodation costs. They certainly can't have those opportunities if Monash University Peninsula Campus, in my electorate, can't afford to keep offering what it's offering because it doesn't get the support from the government. That's why I stand to speak on the second reading amendment today. I commend it to the House, and I commend the other side of the chamber to really think about the value of universities and what they give to society.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  I thank the member for Dunkley for her contribution and also thank the member for Grey, who spoke earlier. Following on from the member for Grey's speech, these changes are technical in nature. The bill seeks to amend the Student Assistance Act to make it consistent with the social security laws in the areas of tax file number collection, information management et cetera. These amendments don't place any additional administrative burden on funding receipts, and in some cases will lead to a streamlined process in terms of Abstudy and the Assistance of Isolated Children Scheme, or the AIC. They are technical, but I would like to address the issue of the real disadvantage of some of my communities and the opportunities they are now receiving through government programs and partnerships with country universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in the country town of Kempsey. There were no universities between Kempsey and Newcastle or Queensland. There are now two excellent universities at Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour: Southern Cross University and Charles Sturt University. One might think that the people who are disadvantaged in our smaller communities might just go to those closer universities only 50 or 60 kilometres away, but the opposite is indeed the fact. These people are people who need to work, who don't have the opportunities to go to the private universities, to pay those fees or to travel. So I was really pleased that a country university centre was opened in Kempsey only recently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was preparing and looking at the figures something in those statistics really hit me. During semesters 1 and 2 in 2020 in the country universities they supported over 1,060 students from 38 universities. Forty-seven per cent of those people studying were the first in their family to study. Just let that sink in—the first in their family. Seventy-six per cent of that 47 per cent were female, eight per cent were of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander heritage and 57 per cent were over the age of 25. So, in opening a country university centre, you're not just opening a place where people can go to do their work online. It's not just a pretty centre with a cafe or a kitchen or world-class internet. It is opportunity—opportunity for people who have never had that pathway to change their life. It is life-changing. It's not just a certificate. It's not just a degree saying you have a Bachelor of Laws. It's an opportunity to get a better job. It's an opportunity to get better pay, and, in doing so, to have a better lifestyle and, in the circumstance that you have a family, provide a better pathway and a better lifestyle for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Selfishly, as the member for Cowper, I say that what it does is makes our communities better. There was a young lady who was at the opening. She told the story that she started with one of the country university centres. She was working part time, going to the country university centre where she was living, and she completed her first degree. She was the first person in her family to do so. She is now doing her masters at the country university centre in Kempsey. She was in her mid-20s. She said she never thought she would even have a degree. She thought she would be working in retail or in the supermarkets, like her family had done, like her siblings had done. But because of these opportunities she now has opened up her world. While she might have started in retail, she can go and do all those things that the member for Dunkley said. She is not precluded by anything because of those opportunities presented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about universities, sometimes we need to wind it right back and talk about those opportunities, which the small changes in this bill are providing to those who are not so fortunate. Many of us in this chamber don't know adversity. We've been privileged. I put myself in that category. I've never had to struggle. We've all gone out and got jobs, or second jobs, and put ourselves through university, or gone off and then studied later in life. But some people don't have those opportunities. They don't know how to get them. They don't know the pathways. And this country university in a small country town, like the other 25 or 26 across Australia, is changing people's lives, one by one, because of those opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To suggest that the federal government is taking these opportunities away from young Australians who want to better themselves—I'm sorry, but that's just a falsehood. That's a myth. The federal government is out there, trying to help these people help themselves, because, in doing so, we create more jobs, we create the environment to create more jobs and we make Australia a better nation. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144732" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:36</span>):  I rise this evening to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Assistance and Other Measures) Bill 2021. Labor will support this bill, as it makes commonsense administrative changes to the operation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Study Assistance Scheme, or Abstudy, and the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme, or AIC. The two schemes were introduced to provide financial assistance to students and their families, improving equality of access to education and study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2020 the Abstudy scheme provided financial assistance to around 27,000 students at school, university and TAFE. It helps to reduce financial barriers for First Nations people to tertiary education and training, and access to education is a key target of Closing the Gap. In 2019-20 the AIC scheme assisted around 13,000 students, enabling children living in rural and remote areas to have access to continuing and appropriate education. The provisions in this bill align the tax file number regime under the Student Assistance Act 1973 with the collection and use of tax file numbers under social security laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, all claimants of the two schemes, including primary school children, are required to provide a tax file number to Services Australia. This bill removes this anomaly and puts in place tax file number provisions that are consistent with social security law. Only the parents will now need to submit a tax file number when applying for the AIC scheme. That makes a lot of sense. The provisions will also clarify the information management arrangements for the isolated children scheme, aligning them with existing Abstudy provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the contents of the bill are uncontroversial, it does highlight failures by the Morrison government, including its coalition partner, the Nationals, to provide high-quality education for students in regional and remote areas. For students accessing Abstudy and the AIC scheme, the legislative changes are inconsequential, and real reform is needed to ensure the fast-tracking of benefits to families. This is a government that goes on and on about red tape, but it sees the mantra extending only to business and to wealthier Australians. For these students and their families, reducing the red tape of these schemes and actually delivering better education outcomes for them should be a priority. Updating the administrative processes of these schemes does not require legislative change, just political will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">University is transformative for anyone who attends. We should be ensuring that anyone with the ability and the will can attend university, if they want to, without barriers. That is why the Labor Party, during World War II, introduced support for Australians to undertake study and training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Whitlam government, Abstudy was reformed into a means tested payment scheme, and the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme was established to assist students in the bush. Despite 27,000 students accessing Abstudy, we know that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students are significantly underrepresented in higher education. They are underrepresented in universities, comprising 1.3 per cent of the domestic higher education student population compared with 3.3 per cent of the total Australian population. Research from the University of Newcastle also shows that many high-achieving Indigenous students are not going to university, despite the fact that their non-Indigenous counterparts with similar academic scores are going to university. This is not good enough. It shows how much work there is to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For this, we need a well-funded and strong university system that can provide support for First Nations students to access university and excel while they are there. Following COVID-19, it is clear to me that our universities are not in a strong position to do this. The budget last night was a further indication of the disdain that the Morrison government holds for the Australian university sector, which it abandoned throughout the COVID-19 crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Canberra, I represent a university town. The Australian National University, the University of Canberra, UNSW, the Australian Catholic University and Charles Sturt University mean that Canberra is a true centre of excellence for Australian research and learning. Students and academics from across Australia and around the world come here to contribute to this academic ecosystem, and I am proud to represent them all. The pandemic has been an incredible challenge for all of Canberra's universities, with almost no support from the Morrison government for the university sector, including the absurd decision to prevent universities from accessing JobKeeper. Our universities have faced major budget cuts and job losses. Major projects have been put on hold. Important research has been abandoned. Students have been forced to study remotely or withdraw altogether.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The border closures have posed an incredible challenge with international students unable to return to Australia to study. The impact for these students is immense and the economic impact on our universities cannot be understated. This is an existential threat for our universities across Australia, who are struggling to adjust to the reality of restricted budgets. As Professor Brian Schmidt, Vice-Chancellor of the ANU has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a wholesale border closure for another couple of years … will have profound effects on the higher education sector, to the point where it's hard for me to actually imagine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Schmidt has called on the government to find safe ways to quarantine students to Australia at scale with appropriate safeguards in place. Professor Schmidt said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We need to really work to find systems that do not cause public health issues for the nation, but really enable our students to get on with their lives</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Considering all this, the Morrison government's decision to further gut university funding by 9.3 per cent in last night's budget is truly breathtaking. It is an unbelievable decision by this government who do not value higher education and do not understand the massive economic benefits of a highly educated workforce and world-class research being done here in Australia. Last night, the Morrison government's budget confirmed that over $1 billion in cuts will be made to Australian universities, gutting funding from research and finally confirming that the increase in university fees previously announced is to compensate for cuts to Commonwealth funding. This government attacks not only our universities but also the students who go there. They are loading up our students with a lifetime of debt, increasing the barriers to university for poorer students for whom university could be transformative. We know that it is poorer students who are more debt averse, so it is clear that the government has chosen to abandon students of low-income families who want to go to university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, Scott Morrison passed a bill that makes it even harder and more expensive for Australians to go to university. Around 40 per cent of students will have their fees increased to $14,500 per year, including students of law, commerce, accountancy, economics and communications; doubling fees for some students in humanities. That is more than the fees for people doing medicine and dentistry degrees. Fees for law, commerce, business and communication degrees will increase by thousands of dollars per year. It is making students go into American style debt ,which will have lasting consequences throughout their life, including when saving for a home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's more, there's no evidence that studying these degrees will make you less job-ready than studying any other. The employment prospects of humanities students is extremely healthy. In fact, according to research from Victoria University, people with humanities degrees have higher employment rates than science or maths graduates. Think about the year 12s graduating last year or this year and what they've been through as they have completed their high school studies. The last thing they need is for the university sector to be gutted. It should be something we are investing in at this time, more than ever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believe that education and jobs go hand in hand and, by locking young Australians out of uni, Scott Morrison is locking them out of jobs. We want every Australian to get a great education, no matter where they live, to have the training they need to get a job and to get ahead and stay ahead, whether that's at uni or TAFE. But this government abandoned unis when COVID-19 hit. As of January 2021, more than 17,000 people had lost their jobs in Australian universities since the beginning of the pandemic. Universities Australia forecasts further cuts this year. I guess this government doesn't see some jobs as important as others. So far these losses equate to 13 per cent of the pre-COVID university workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Job losses have been tragic for universities such as the Australian National University. ANU has announced 465 job losses, with 415 people already out of work due to this government's abandonment of the national university. ANU is the only national university, which means this parliament is responsible for it. All the other universities receive support from their state or territory parliaments, but for ANU this parliament is it's source of funding. The Morrison government should have done more for ANU during the pandemic, as well as all the other universities in my electorate and around this country. I commend the work of the National Tertiary Education Union and its secretary Cathy Day at ANU for standing up for their members and workers at ANU. But the Morrison government has put the ANU in an impossible position by providing no support. Job cuts are incredibly difficult for institutions and for communities like Canberra, and for my constituents who have lost their jobs I am so sorry that their federal government didn't protect their jobs by providing JobKeeper to universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other groups that this government did nothing for through the pandemic is students. They missed out on JobKeeper if they were employed in casual employment, as most of them were, and they also missed out on the increase to JobSeeker. We provide youth allowance to students who are eligible. It is my deep belief that, by enabling students to study, this is an investment in the future of this country. I believe that all social security payments are an investment in our citizens and people having dignity and a decent standard of living, but this government clearly doesn't see it that way. Not only are they placing these enormous debts on young people who want to go and study at our universities; they are making it impossible because young people cannot meet the living costs. Think about moving to an expensive city like Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane and just trying to get by if you don't have parental support—or even if you do. It is a huge sacrifice and it is very hard for students. We see rates of dropout from university in Australia that are incredibly high, and they shouldn't be this high. It's my guess that the reason is that people simply cannot sustain trying to work enough to meet their rent and bills while they are trying to study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be investing in these young people, particularly in First Nations people, who want to be going to university in this country. We should be investing in all Australian citizens having a decent standard of living. But particularly in this way we're not just hitting these young people with an enormous debt that might prevent them from saving for a home, making it difficult for them when they are starting a family; they also simply cannot make that decision to move to an expensive place to study at university if they cannot work full time in multiple jobs at the same time in an increasingly hostile job market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while we'll pass this bill, as I say, there is so much more that this government could do to support our university sector. It's an absolutely critical time at the moment when it should be doing that, as we are in a global pandemic. And it could be better supporting our young people. They are facing an incredibly difficult future at the moment under this government that refuses to back them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265990" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  I rise to make my contribution to the debate on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Assistance and Other Measures) Bill 2021. The pandemic has devastated many sectors in Australia, higher education chief amongst them. But the situation in our tertiary sector needn't have been as bad as it has been. This sector is reeling not only because of the pandemic but also as a result of the government's failure both currently and historically. Job losses are in the thousands and increased fees make a university education harder to acquire. This will be the legacy of the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Higher education should have a bright future in Australia. Australia is a world leader in education, and that reputation should not be taken lightly. Australian students and our educational institutions deserve our support, but this government is choosing not to act. The risk from the government's negligence and inaction is real and measurable. As the Victoria University found in its April 2020 report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian investment in education: higher education</span>, despite increases over the past decade, funding for domestic students has plateaued and participation rates for domestic students in higher education are decreasing for the first time in over 10 years. The OECD data shows that Australia spends less as a total on education than Austria, Canada, Denmark, Greece, Botswana, Libya, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Senegal and many other countries. This government either doesn't understand or doesn't care about the important socioeconomic role that higher education plays now and will play into the future. Instead, it passes a bill that makes it harder and more expensive for Australians to go to university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night's budget confirms that the government is saving money by increasing university fees and student debt. Fees for law, commerce, business and communications will increase by thousands of dollars per year, and fees for humanities degrees will double. Many young Australians will be graduating with debts of up to $60,000 for a basic degree. The government pleads that these courses are not job relevant, but statistics say otherwise, with humanities graduates more likely to get a job than some of their counterparts in the STEM subjects. Students who want to pursue a degree in the humanities are frowned upon by this government. On the one hand it say it wants to benefit all students, but then, on the other, it takes away aspiration. It is yet another attack on arts and humanities in Australia that this government so silently but gleefully engages in. Forcing students to take on American-style debt will not help them into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Labor knows that a good education and good jobs go hand in hand. By locking young Australians out of uni, the government is locking them out of jobs, and it doesn't help that now, particularly in regional and remote Australia, there is a wide gap between regional and urban areas in access to education and study. This gap will stagnate and widen with the changes to university fees. It's already very difficult for those in regional and remote areas, and especially difficult for Indigenous students, who are more likely to enrol in courses affected by these changes. A Senate inquiry into the impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students found that 52 per cent of Indigenous students were enrolled in humanities based disciplines. This means that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students will graduate with higher HECS debts and will move into the workforce with a higher financial burden than their non-Indigenous counterparts. This bill is designed to support the Indigenous students who are facing this incredibly unfair financial burden. It also enables students who live in rural and regional areas to access continuing and appropriate education. However, it's not enough. The higher education sector needs more support, and it needs it now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the beginning of the pandemic more than 17,000 people have lost their jobs at Australian universities. Thirteen per cent of the pre-COVID university workforce is now out of a job. There have been 300 job losses from Central Queensland University, 145 from Charles Sturt University, 210 from the University of New England and 400 from Deakin University. These are small numbers compared to the job losses in our cities and suburbs. Universities Australia forecasts further losses this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of the job losses on regional communities is particularly devastating. Universities support 14,000 jobs in country Australia. They can often be the largest employers in regional towns. Academics, tutors, administration staff and many other workers have lost their jobs—and it is crucial to point out here that, with fewer teachers, a student's education also suffers. These people have families. They need to put food on the table and pay their bills. This year's budget shows that the Liberals don't care about these families. In last year's budget the Prime Minister withheld JobKeeper from universities, amounting to an estimated $9 billion in support lost for the families. This budget hurts university workers; it doesn't help them. These families deserve support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having lived in Western Sydney my entire life, I know the impact a well-funded tertiary institution can have on a region. When Gough Whitlam was first elected as the member for Werriwa in 1952, there wasn't a high school, let alone a university, in the electorate. University participation rates in Sydney's south-western suburbs were the lowest in Australia. Gough was not just instrumental in ensuring that tertiary education was a right of all Australians but also an active champion for the establishment of a university in Western Sydney. In just over three decades, Western Sydney University's impact on the region has been immense, becoming one of the driving forces in the transformation. No doubt this true for many regional universities, cities and towns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the beginning of the pandemic Labor urged the federal government to act to help universities and save jobs. The sector forecast these job losses from early 2020—so it wasn't a surprise. It is unfortunate that the government chose to do nothing. Our fourth-largest expert industry, built under Prime Ministers Whitlam, Hawke, and Keating, should have been supported by this government. The government's disregard for higher education became even more clear when they declared higher education institutions not eligible for JobKeeper. It was not just the barring of JobKeeper that was the main region for the job losses in the sector; it was the straw that broke the camel's back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pandemic has exposed chronic under-resourcing by consecutive coalition governments. Many Australian students are working to support themselves during COVID-19 while also studying and paying tuition fees. Many have also had their income significantly reduced or their jobs were lost altogether. As higher fees make higher education less accessible, there is a limited opportunity for students who want to study and contribute to our society and economy—a limitation that is based solely on their financial standing. Access to higher education should never be subject to one's financial circumstances. Supporting higher education for students has been key to our economic success over several decades. It is also key to our long-term future if we want a smart and a dynamic economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Werriwa I see the impact that higher education can have. Western Sydney University has, in just 30 short years, become a driving force of transformation in Sydney and contributed to advancements across Australia. I have previously, on many occasions, spoken in this place about the fantastic job that WSU does—and particularly during the pandemic, where it supported its international students and other students. However, WSU has now succumbed to involuntary redundancies. Just over 150 staff are now out of a job, as the university's continuing struggle with the pandemic has meant that these jobs needed to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are higher fees and fewer staff. It seems that this government doesn't want people to be educated, especially in areas that are already disadvantaged. We know that, if universities were supported, these people would still be in a job and students would be receiving a much higher standard of education than what they are now facing, and the stress on the teachers would be much less. These institutions are working hard to keep their digital doors open, but it pales in comparison to the efforts that this government has made to ensure equity in education and the long-term survival of one of our largest industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia was built on the idea of a fair go. If you've got raw talent and skills, we'll harness them and ensure you become the best possible person you can be. We're not a country that hinders your choice of career or education because of your financial or economic background. We have the power to protect university enrolments as well as ease the burden for university students in all regions of the country. By protecting enrolments and assisting universities now, we have exponential benefits for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the support for students and higher education institutions across Australia is not happening, and we know who is responsible. More needs to be done to support institutions that mould our society and create platforms for economic growth and success. My colleagues and I will make sure that the higher education sector receives what it fundamentally needs and what it wholeheartedly deserves—investment in our social and economic future. We need these things to happen. There needs to be real structural change and reform if we are to improve equality of access to education Australia-wide.</span>

This bill makes amendments to the Student Assistance Act in relation to Abstudy and Assistance for Isolated Children, known as the AIC scheme. Abstudy provides support to Indigenous secondary and tertiary students and apprentices, while the AIC scheme provides support to isolated primary and secondary students. In 2020, about 27,000 students were assisted through the Abstudy scheme and around 13,000 through the AIC scheme. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Student Assistance Act provides the legislative framework for Abstudy and AIC matters, including in relation to tax file number collection and information management. This bill amends provisions in the act to provide greater clarity around their operational intent and, where appropriate, aligns them with equivalent provisions within social security legislation to reduce red tape and improve operational efficiency. The amendments in the bill do not impose an additional administrative burdens on recipients and in some cases will reduce it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes a number of technical amendments to social services legislation to confirm that the definition of 'social security law' includes legislative instruments. This bill strengthens our student support system so that it can focus on the important task of ensuring that Indigenous students and isolated students from across Australia have the opportunity to gain a first-class education. In response to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, I thank the committee for their work, and to address their concerns I have tabled an addendum explanatory memorandum. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this bill. This bill makes administrative changes to the Higher Education Support Act and to the Education Services for Overseas Students Act designed to fix uncontroversial and recognised issues in the existing legislation. The bill amends the citizenship requirements within the Higher Education Loan Program to ensure that students on humanitarian visas do not lose access for travelling overseas after spending five years in Australia and empowers the minister to extend the availability of HELP from 1 January 2022 to students who have previously held permanent humanitarian visas. It's a worthwhile change that improves access for visa holders to Australia's world-class higher education system.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also contains a number of other technical amendments which remedy the nomenclature of the university funding clusters, where Indigenous languages are classified as foreign languages; streamline the operation of grant funding; clarify the operation of grandfathering arrangements under the Liberal's increased university fees; and, finally, extend the ESOS Act to former registered providers to strengthen the operation of the Tuition Protection Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Labor does not oppose any of these measures. The government have passed more than 10 pieces of legislation on higher education and, in instances where they have made sensible decisions, as is so here, Labor has been pleased to support them. But, as a whole, when we look at what's happening in higher education policy under this government, it's responsible for massively increased student fees, with thousands of young Australians locked out of university education. So it's all very well to be working on these small, minor technical amendments, welcome as they are, but at the heart of this government's university policy is a policy that makes it harder and more expensive for Australian students to go to university. It's sad that when young Australians are facing an uncertain future, with wildly increasing house prices and uncertainty around their future careers, caused by the COVID recession and its aftermath, that the best this government can do for uni students is to jack up fees and lock people out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw in last night's budget was a continuation of this policy to make it harder and more expensive for young Australians to get a university education. The budget papers confirmed for the first time that the Liberals are saving money. There was all the smoke and mirrors last year about some fees going up and some fees going down. The budget papers show in black and white that this government is cutting government funding for universities and that it's jacking up university fees. Students are paying more. Page 170 of Budget Paper No. 1 says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, HECS debts will jump by $1½ billion over the next three years as many students take out much bigger debts—much bigger loans—to pay for the new higher fees that this government has imposed upon them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our universities educate over a million Australians and employ over 100,000 more. This budget is saying to them, 'Nothing to see here, nothing for you here, just move along.' Labor doesn't want Australia to become like America, with student debts that will last a lifetime and hang like an albatross around the necks of our young Australians. We're now talking about our young Australians graduating with university debts of $60,000. An ordinary three-year bachelor's degree with a honours year will have a $60,000 debt. Those students are graduating into a less secure labour market. They're graduating into a housing market where they will be trying to save a deposit for an increasingly-out-of-reach family home. They're graduating into a world where wages are flatlining but expenses are going up. Childcare costs are going up, if they're thinking about starting a family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really feel for this generation of young people. They had the year from hell last year, trying to finish high school in the middle of COVID lockdowns with remote learning, and they've hit university with, in many cases, course costs that are double what they had anticipated when they made the decision about what they wanted to study when they finished high school. Scott Morrison's huge university fees and huge university debts will rob young Australians of the jobs of their dreams. The Prime Minister is not setting kids up for success; he's loading them up with a lifetime of debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the government brought forward some research funding due to the massive shortfall in revenue, driven by the fact that international students, who subsidise a great deal of our university research, were not able to come to Australia. Billions of dollars was lost from university revenue, and the government brought forward about $1 billion in research funding. Seven months later the borders are still closed, and there is no indication of when international students might be able to come back to Australia. Of course we believe that Australians should be brought back safely first, but, with the vaccine rollout as it is and the hopeless lack of commitment from the federal government to federal quarantine facilities, who knows when that will be. The fact is we can't get Australians home safely and there are still 40,000 stuck overseas, desperate to get home, despite the fact that the Prime Minister said they would be home by Christmas. That failure to get Australians home has the knock-on effect of holding up international students in returning to Australia. The flow-on effect for universities and for research in particular is catastrophic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen from our universities a desperate struggle to keep up their research functions. Around the country universities are giving up on things that they used to do well in research, because they can't afford to do them anymore. It's ironic that last night the Treasurer was talking about this new patent box. He spoke about Australia's world-leading innovations—wi-fi, the bionic ear, the Gardasil vaccine. Where on earth does the government believe that the basic research, the breakthroughs, the innovation, the discovery, the invention, comes from if not from our brilliant university researchers, thousands of whom have lost their jobs because of budget cuts to research from this government? You can't gut university funding, trash our academics and then imagine that we'll somehow have world-leading research to commercialise and turn into the jobs that will drive Australian prosperity in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of funding for university research is directly linked to lower prosperity for this country in the future. We've seen more than 17,000 jobs lost at universities because of the pig-headed decision to stop universities having access to JobKeeper when other businesses had access. Remember, this government changed the rules three times deliberately to exclude universities from receiving JobKeeper. The impact of that is at least 17,000 job cuts at last count. What's bizarre about it is that it was okay to fund our big casinos to get JobKeeper. Apparently, it was okay to fund companies that had made record profits. They got to keep JobKeeper. But our universities that are teaching the next generation of engineers, nurses, teachers, accountants, lawyers and doctors, the universities that are discovering and inventing the things that will make us a richer, safer, smarter and healthier country, don't get JobKeeper. So, of course, we have lost academic and teaching staff, affecting the research output of our universities and affecting their ability to teach Australian students. We have not only lost academic and teaching staff and researchers; we've also lost groundskeepers, librarians, admin staff and the cook in the cafeteria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time one of these jobs is lost, a family loses a secure income. When those job losses are in regional centres, the impact is huge. If you take a few hundred jobs out of a regional community, we all know what the impact of that will be on that regional community. I could give you examples from around Australia, but let's just take Central Queensland. The campuses at Biloela and Yeppoon are closing. Of course that impacts on the ability of students in that region to get an education, but what do those job losses do to those towns? Universities support 14,000 jobs in regional Australia. When you start closing campuses and sacking staff, I would think the Nationals, at least, would understand the catastrophic effect that that has on regional communities. And courses have been cut—courses in engineering, creative arts, chemistry and agriculture. Across universities no faculty has been spared.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't get why those opposite were prepared to extend JobKeeper to businesses like casinos—successful companies making record profits and paying huge executive bonuses—but were not prepared to extend JobKeeper to Australian universities, leading to researchers, teachers, groundskeepers, cafeteria workers and librarians losing their jobs and losing their ability to support their families. Let's look at the job losses, and these are the ones we know about. This is just a taste of the regional job losses: Central Queensland University, 296 jobs; Charles Sturt University, 145 jobs; Deakin, 400; RMIT, 200; UNSW, almost 500; New England, 210; Monash, 277; and Melbourne, 450. The list goes on and on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's record, in contrast, is a record of opening up university education to more Australians. A lot of people a little older than me know they have the Whitlam government to thank for their university education, and they stop me on the street and tell me that. 'I came from a working-class family,' they say. 'We would never have been able to afford a university education if Gough Whitlam hadn't opened it up to people like me, to families like mine.' That's my family's story. It's the story of a lot of people on this side. My dad was a plumber; my mum—</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the middle of a climate crisis, this budget finds $11.4 billion for fossil fuels this year alone and another $1.1 billion for new coal and gas projects, but nothing, for example, for electrifying transport, a sector responsible for 16 per cent of our emissions. This budget is champagne for the billionaires and real pain for everybody else. In fact, this budget is based on real wages going backwards for two years. It's tax cuts for the billionaires and handouts for big corporations but wage cuts for workers and poverty for the unemployed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the pandemic, while the rest of us were locked down and wages were flat, the billionaires made out like bandits. While young people went backwards, Australia's billionaires grew their wealth faster than billionaires anywhere else in the world. Australia's billionaires are like those wartime profiteers who, while the rest of the nation is making a sacrifice in a collective effort, lined their own pockets with cash. Gina Rinehart more than doubled her wealth during the pandemic and is now worth $36 billion. Twiggy, Rinehart and Clive Palmer increased their personal wealth by 141 per cent between them during the pandemic. This extreme wealth generation is obscene. We are creating a class of oligarchs who have too much power.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone in this country deserves free child care and free education, everyone deserves Medicare backed dental and mental health care, everyone deserves to live in an affordable home and everyone deserves a well-paid, secure job if they want one. Instead, we have billions in handouts for big corporations and billionaires. We have Kerry Stokes with a new private jet, and we have Gerry Harvey refusing to pay back JobKeeper, while dishing out shareholder profits and CEO bonuses thanks to the public purse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we can fix this. At the next election, a swing against this terrible Morrison government will most likely put the Greens in the balance of power in both houses of parliament. The Greens are a few hundred votes away from holding the balance of power. In the balance of power after the next election, the Greens will bring in a series of new taxes on billionaires to make them pay their fair share. We recently announced a six per cent ongoing billionaires tax. It's urgent that we make them pay. They won't like it, but I don't care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we announce our next plan: to tax the extreme wealth that billionaires accrued during the pandemic. We will introduce a one-off, 50 per cent tax on the increase in their wealth during the last 12 months. This tax only applies to 122 people but is worth $29 billion. It's only half of the increases in wealth that billionaires made during the pandemic—a crisis where we all made sacrifices—but it will be used to benefit all 25 million people in this country. Again, the billionaires will not like it, but I don't care. I care about the 25 million, the ones who were forced to raid their super or were denied government support because they worked in universities, the arts or cultural industries, or were in casual and insecure work. I care about the people who fought to keep a roof over their head, not the Australian billionaires who bought new jets thanks to government handouts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to see the university and arts sector restored, not decimated, and I want to see us start to build back better, with renewable infrastructure that can replace our dirty coal and gas export industry and so that we electrify Australia's transport and create hundreds of thousands of jobs. And let's build one million new public housing homes for low-income earners while creating thousands of new apprenticeships in the process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To fight the climate crisis and become a renewable energy superpower, we need to electrify our nation. Critical to the transformation is the electrification of our transport system, but this budget has no money to support the shift to electric vehicles. Sixty per cent of the budget's new infrastructure spend is on roads but not one dollar for EV charging infrastructure on those roads. The rest of the world is moving to electric vehicles and Australia is not ready. The revenue raised by the billionaires tax would help fund investments in charging infrastructure for our road network and for businesses and public buildings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />At the next election we will kick the Liberals out and we will push the next government to go further and faster. Further and faster on tackling the billionaires, further and faster on pushing up wages and creating jobs, further and faster on tackling the climate crisis.

The budget announced a further tranche of funding for the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, which will deliver $15 million in additional funding to assist local councils in the Lyne electorate so that they can undertake important community projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have five local governments represented in my electorate of Lyne. To this time $36 million has been available under this program. Partnering with councils and delivering stuff that people have really been clamouring for for a long time is really rewarding, whether it's town beautification, pool upgrades, local roads, cycleways—even footpaths in high-traffic areas around schools, where pedestrian safety, crossings and all those sorts of things can finally be delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Port Macquarie-Hastings and the Camden Haven I was very pleased to work with Peta Pinson, the local mayor, to initiate upgrades at the Lake Cathie Foreshore, Telegraph Point, Kendall, Comboyne and to help fund the beach-to-beach shared pathway. Also, new sporting facilities for Laurieton and Lake Cathie and safety pathways in Beechwood, Wauchope and Comboyne. The tennis club in the amazing Kendall district, which is going from to strength to strength, will now be able to completely fund a new tennis court.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mayor David West from MidCoast Council and I were really pleased to finally fund the long-awaited Wingham main street upgrade, as well as the Tuncurry water park and a new performance space for the Manning Entertainment Centre, which is a cultural hub in the Manning-Great Lakes. There are also town beautification works in Wingham and Taree, and in Tea Gardens some upgrades to the disability access and general access to the pool. Gloucester netball courts and the Gloucester recreation grounds will now benefit from upgrades. The Allworth riverside reserve will get a much needed upgrade so that their wharf area will be usable. Park and recreation improvements at Old Bar, Pacific Palms, Bulahdelah, Tuncurry and Hawks Nest will all be funded. Harrington Men's Shed and Harrington Little Athletics are getting facility upgrades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was really pleased to work with John Connors, the Mayor of Dungog, to announce extra funds to contribute to the new Dungog Library extension. It will now, finally, be fully funded with these additional funds. Bennett Park is where Doug Walters hit his first six as a young man. The upgrades in drainage and surface water will mean it will be able to be used so much more, and a new picket-style fence that they've had planned for ages will now become a reality. Likewise, the Clarence Town village green, the school of arts and the Lions park are all receiving funding via council mechanisms as a result of this. The Bridge Reserve will get a new amenities block. The Bridge Reserve is one of the biggest tourist attractions, so it will mean much more economic activity when all those tourists come to the riverside reserve. Martins Creek hall will celebrate its 100th year with getting new access delivered. Paterson and Crestwood schools of arts will get disability access. The very popular John Tucker Park will get shaded playgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bolwarra Sports Complex is an issue that Mayor Loretta Baker and I have been working on for some years. It will now have a new irrigation system for the fields and access paths built. It's also a high-traffic area and on school days it will mean the kids will be able to get into the school via the park by new access pathways. Bolwarra school parents will also be pleased to find that new footpaths for pram and disability access will be finally delivered at the school. Largs school students will also have a safer walk. The amazing views from Bolwarra lookout and the park will be redeveloped, with the resealing of the car park, a new toilet block, barbecue facilities, landscaping and a playground. This will transform this hidden gem, with views across the Hunter River river flats. Mayor Ryan Palmer and I visited Longworth Park— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  This time last week, I stood with members of my community to remember those who are no longer with us. At the Ipswich Domestic and Family Violence Remembrance Day event, we remembered the victims. One in six women and one in 16 men have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a current or previous partner. While we acknowledge that anyone can be a victim—men, women and children—the fact is that women and children are overrepresented as victims. Each week, on average, one woman is killed by her intimate partner. This is unacceptable and disgraceful in our country. Domestic and family violence is a scourge and an epidemic. One of the speakers at the rally last week was Amie Carrington, the CEO of the Domestic Violence Action Centre, DVAC, based in Ipswich and Toowoomba.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are coming to the end of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022, yet the rate of domestic violence remains undiminished. In fact, domestic homicides of women account for a third of all homicides in Australia. One such homicide occurred in the leafy Brisbane suburb of Brookfield in April 2012. We all know her name: Allison Baden-Clay. She was murdered at the hands of her husband. Alison's family has a special connection with her. Her parents, Geoff and Priscilla, are raising her daughters in Ipswich, supported by her sister, Vanessa Fowler. They attended the vigil last week. Vanessa, who is the chair of the Allison Baden-Clay Foundation, was the guest speaker. She spoke beautifully and brilliantly. She admits that the family didn't recognise the warning signs for Allison. Now they've dedicated themselves to eliminating and taking concrete action to stop domestic and family violence. They report that 46 per cent of women and 70 per cent of men who have experienced violence from a current partner do not seek advice or support after the incident or report it. The Allison Baden-Clay Foundation has now established the MATE Bystander Program, which uses Allison's story to help workplaces identify the signs, including coercive control, and to learn how to be an effective bystander.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coercive control is an insidious form of controlling behaviour which includes threats, assault, intimidation, humiliation and many other forms of abuse that erode a person's autonomy and their ability to thrive. Before entering parliament, I was an accredited family law specialist for nearly a quarter of a century. I practised in family law and child protection. The issues in my personal life influenced my decision to do so. As a lawyer, I witnessed the damaging impact of coercive control and other forms of domestic violence on people and their children. We all have a responsibility to call out bad behaviour, to step in rather than step aside and to support family and friends. After all, the evil we walk past is the evil we accept.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget has handed down some additional funding. One of the hidden impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic is on women's health, wellbeing and their experiences of violence. I express my deep appreciation to those at the front line at DVAC and the Allison Baden-Clay Foundation. I recently visited DVAC in Ipswich to inquire about the funding issues they're experiencing. They report a very large upsurge in the cities and regions serviced by DVAC. In support of DVAC, I recently wrote to Anne Ruston, Minister for Women's Safety, highlighting the need for increased funding for DVAC and the funding for other services to be extended. Currently, DVAC is at the risk of losing 10 staff and 195 hours of service weekly if the COVID funding, which they got recently, is not reinstated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These services need more than a sugar hit or temporary funding. They require increased funding on a long-term basis to address the issues—the scourge and long-term causes of domestic and family violence in our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge there's some additional funding for frontline services in this budget, but the devil is always in the detail, and if you look across to forward estimates you'll see on page 83 of Budget Paper No. 2, under 'Women's Safety', a steep decline, if not a cliff, for the funding. I urge the Prime Minister to reconsider, to look at additional funding for all services, such as the Allison Baden-Clay Foundation and DVAC, who do such great work in South-East Queensland. To ensure we do more than treat the victims we need to address the causes, and these services need permanent ongoing funding support. We must not wait for another senseless murder and the loss of another Allison Baden-Clay before we address these issues.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  The federal budget delivered by the Treasurer last night was carefully formulated to promote Australia's economic recovery, create jobs, provide families with the support services they need and build for the future. At a local level, the budget delivers for the residents of Perth's rapidly growing northern suburbs, with major federal infrastructure funding for roads, the northern suburbs railway and community buildings. To support our infrastructure needs, I am pleased to inform the House that the Commonwealth Grants Commission recently announced that the state of Western Australia will receive a GST payment of approximately $5.3 billion in 2021-22. This figure is $629 million more than anticipated in last year's budget. This increased revenue reflects the strength of our economic recovery, enabling the WA state government to fund projects around Moore. A fact that is often overlooked by our state members is that, ultimately, much of the infrastructure committed to during the recent WA state election by the McGowan government is federally funded through this distribution. My home state of Western Australia will receive $1.6 billion for projects designed to ease congestion, connect communities and improve road safety. This investment will support the national economic recovery in the short term and boost productivity in the long term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With one in five residents aged over 60 in Moore, a record investment in aged care will assist approximately 18,877 senior Australians living in my electorate. This investment will provide more healthcare places and more funding for residential aged-care facilities while equipping regulators to monitor and enforce standards of care. I am pleased to report that leading aged-care providers are developing modern aged-care facilities, currently in the planning phase, and are about to commence construction in suburbs including Joondalup, Currambine and Kinross. This will increase the supply of modern, purpose-built aged-care accommodation available locally, helping to shorten the long waiting lists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are fortunate to have a range of quality schools in our suburbs, both public and private, many of which are having their facilities upgraded and are delivering excellent outcomes for our younger generation. Funding for preschool and public schools in Moore continues to increase as part of the Quality Schools package, placing importance on the education system. For young families, child care is now more affordable and accessible in this budget, directly benefiting 1,320 families in Moore, allowing parents to return to the workforce, contributing their skills and boosting productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hospitals, Medicare, mental health and disability support services will always be guaranteed under the Morrison government. Construction work on a major $256 million upgrade of Joondalup hospital is about to commence. The government has committed to fund essential medications recommended by medical experts, putting lifesaving treatment within the reach of everyone. Over the last year, more than 1.6 million low-cost, subsidised prescriptions have been filled for residents in my electorate under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in an effort to return more of their hard-earned wages to their bank accounts to spend according to their choice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Approximately 58,300 taxpayers of Moore will benefit from tax relief of up to $2,745 this year. This is as a result of extending the low- and middle-income tax offset and to bring forward stage 2 of the tax relief plan carried out by the Morrison government. The tax relief plan has already benefited 69,800 people in my electorate. The HomeBuilder program has assisted owner-occupiers with grants of $25,000 to build new homes and to renovate existing homes. The program has received 17,752 applications in WA and has backed over 36,000 jobs in the construction industry, creating steady work for local tradespersons and subcontractors. This budget will ensure that we come back even stronger, securing Australia's economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  What we see with this budget is a marketing exercise, with little genuine reform. After eight long years this government has provided the Australian people with countless examples of mismanagement. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Defence portfolio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's budget was light on detail when it comes to the Defence portfolio. This is a government where secrecy reigns and transparency barely exists. We hear the government talk tough on defence, with the Prime Minister walking red carpets and waving from defence aircraft. What we hear is rhetoric and re-announcements, with little information on what's happening to build defence capability. How much defence expenditure is based on the $40 billion blowout on the Future Submarine program? How much is based on the $10 billion blowout on frigates? How much is based on previously announced funding, such as the $747 million infrastructure package for the Northern Territory?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this NT package was announced two years ago, except now it's costing half a billion dollars more. Why? That is not explained. We know with this Prime Minister that it's all about the announcement, never the delivery. After six defence ministers in eight years, there has been mismanagement and waste at the expense of our troops. Labor fully supports our ADF having the capabilities they require. We want to see our troops resourced with assets and technology that are fit for purpose. We want to see a commitment to local industry content in our defence manufacturing. We also want to see our veterans treated with the respect they deserve, with a properly resourced Department of Veterans' Affairs and, most importantly, a royal commission into our national shame that is the tragedy of veteran suicides. We welcome the funding in the budget for a royal commission into defence and veteran suicides, but the truth is that the government came to it kicking and screaming after Labor called for the royal commission in 2019. We want to see the terms of reference and we want to see the composition of the commission before we're satisfied, but we support the funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has also been committed to defence spending being at a minimum of two per cent of GDP since 2013, and we're pleased the government agrees. However, what we know about defence spending is that it's never just about quantum; it's about value for money, delivery and ensuring that the contracts we enter into for the assets our Defence Force requires are implemented properly. Sadly, this government has a history of waste and delay, and we'll be holding them to account by using the parliament and Senate estimates to assess whether what's promised in the budget will in fact be delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent example of mismanaged assets is the $1.6 billion battle management system, with reports that security risks have caused Defence to abandon this system with no replacement in sight. If this is true, it would force our troops to use paper maps and pencils. What are the government doing about that? They need to account for the reports in our media about such an important battle management system. We need to know. Labor expects our troops to be able to access the technology they need to do their job properly to keep Australians safe. If there are concerns with the current system, the government needs to ensure there is no capability gap if a replacement system is to be found.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />We say to the government in relation to these matters that they need to do better. They need to be upfront about what's happening with the largest defence asset contracts in our history. We need to know what's in store for the Future Submarine program. We need to know whether there's going to be a life extension for the Collins class submarines. We need to know the location of the work that's going to be undertaken, because many of these things are still up in the air, providing no certainty for defence industry, no certainty for Defence and, most importantly, no certainty for our defence personnel. That is the test that this government will ultimately be judged by—whether, regardless of its rhetoric and regardless of its posturing, it delivers the defence capability that this country needs to keep its citizens safe.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="291387" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  There is no doubt that Inland Rail is the next big thing in my electorate. This nation-building project will connect our rich agricultural region to interstate and global markets, delivering nearly 12,000 jobs in Queensland during the peak of construction. Many of these jobs will be filled by people from the Toowoomba region, building our local economy and upskilling our workforce. Whilst this project is billed as a port-to-port connection, I feel it's important to understand that the rail line will be used by industry as needed. This will not run like a passenger rail line. The bulk of cargo travelling on Inland Rail is likely to be delivered and distributed from regional hubs in between Melbourne and Brisbane; it's not an end-to-end train service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Toowoomba will be the real winner in the strategic use of this track because we're situated at the intersection of major trucking highways, with access to an international airport. In fact, we're already seeing businesses recognise this opportunity and expand their supply chains. We've had a number of them contact my office and the offices of ministers here about relocating their operations to the region. Industry wants this project, and why wouldn't they? If they choose to invest, they'll also be able to take advantage of connecting projects like InterLinkSQ, the intermodal hub at Charlton. It is the only intermodal hub currently approved on the line. Interfacing works are about to begin, with construction starting in earnest later this year. That will create 2,000 jobs, 1,600 of those ongoing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I took Minister Mark Coulton out to see this site on a trip to my patch last month, and he agreed with me that Toowoomba will be the real winner from Inland Rail—even though, as the member for Parkes, he sits across a long stretch of Inland Rail that has already done so much good. Whilst it's great to see this project finally becoming reality in my region, if there's one thing that I've seen in my 20-odd years of working as an engineer on major projects, it is that there inevitably are difficulties as we interface with affected landholders. The border-to-Gowrie and the Gowrie-to-Helidon sections of the route have already had their fair share of difficulties. That's why it's so important that we establish a social licence for pursuing this rail line and the benefits it will bring not only to the people of the Toowoomba region but to the whole of Australia. We owe it to the people living along the Inland Rail line who will be directly impacted by the work on that line to do that hard work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to this office, I've gone out and sat across the kitchen tables from people who are affected and I've listened to their concerns. I really appreciate the help and feedback that I've had from so many of those good locals—people like Neil Owen—who've driven me along the route and provided me with a candid and frank assessment of how ARTC can improve the delivery of its project. It's important that we listen, and I hope that they'll continue to engage with me as we move beyond the EIS process and into construction. There's no doubt that these are very tough conversations to have and very tough issues to work through, but I think we can do it. I see it as my role to ensure that the Toowoomba region businesses and producers receive the full benefits that Inland Rail will bring to the Toowoomba region. If we dig deep and deliver this project to its maximum potential, we will succeed in increasing the competitiveness between road and rail in moving product to the port of Brisbane, unlocking the strategic potential of the Toowoomba region as a global hub for food and fibre. I'm here for the journey, bringing clear eyes and a cool head, to ensure that Inland Rail delivers for the Toowoomba region now and into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I stood at InterLinkSQ with Minister Coulton, we could see exactly why that site is so important. It truly is a nexus point for connectivity in that region. You can see the Queensland Rail western line running right next to where the Inland Rail will run. Across on the ridge, you can see the Warrego Highway, with trucks constantly passing along it, and the new second range crossing, funded by this government, taking truck traffic down to the port of Brisbane. Above you, in the beautiful blue skies, you can see Cathay Pacific flights taking our region's produce and sending it to the world from the excellent Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport. As John Candy would have it, it's planes, trains and automobiles—plus we have a connection to the port.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This nexus point project will be successful because of the great array of thriving industries that are built around it. Agriculture, mining, energy, manufacturing, defence and transport all have major centres within the Toowoomba region. Of course, all of these industries employ people in the Toowoomba region. These industries will benefit from intermodal hubs like InterLinkSQ, and those employers will bring those financial benefits back into our region. How we use Inland Rail is the great question facing the Toowoomba region. We must focus our attention on ensuring that every possible benefit of Inland Rail is realised.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  I've been privileged to preside over many citizenship ceremonies in Moreton, including for new citizens from the local Indian community. Becoming an Australian is a wonderful celebration, and the new arrivals are always excited to be joining our family. Many Indian Australians were required to give up the citizenship of their home country when they became Australian citizens. They were encouraged to do that and were offered the rights and protections of Australian citizenship wherever they were in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all expect that, as Australians, we will be welcomed home. I believe in the poet Robert Frost's definition of home, which is: 'Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.' From the very inception of English law—from the signing of the Magna Carta over 800 years ago—the right to leave and return to our kingdom unharmed and without fear has been an important right of citizenship in common law countries. Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a signatory, says, 'No-one shall be deprived of the right to enter his own country.' So I'm very troubled by the emergency determination made by the health minister under the Biosecurity Act pausing all passengers from India, including Australian citizens returning home. The media release from Minister Hunt included a grim warning in the fourth paragraph that failure to comply with the determination may incur a fine or five years imprisonment, or both.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Biosecurity Act 2015 gave extraordinary powers to the health minister, powers exempt from parliamentary scrutiny. In 2014, when the biosecurity bill was debated, no-one in parliament could have foreseen how the powers contained in that bill would be used six years later. The word 'pandemic' does not even appear in the 434-page explanatory memorandum. Emergency declarations made under the Biosecurity Act are not disallowable—that is, the people's parliament cannot overturn the minister's declaration. Ordinarily, parliament has oversight of delegated legislation. It is scrutinised by parliamentary committees and able to be disallowed by the parliament. So I'm very troubled that Minister Hunt's emergency declaration is not open to scrutiny and cannot be disallowed by elected representatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My office has been contacted by local families impacted by the travel ban announced by the health minister just before the chimes sounded at midnight. Parents were separated from their children, being threatened with jail if they attempted to come home. This is not something I ever expected to see in Australia, in my country. It is not acceptable that Australians are being threatened with jail if they try to come home. That's not who we are. That's not how families protect their own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Morrison should have heeded warnings last year about the need for surge capacity in quarantine for emergency situations that are just like this. Australians stranded in India should be given immediate support and assisted to safely travel home. I finish with those words of the poet Robert Frost again: 'Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.' That is what my Australia is.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  Around 48,500 taxpayers in the Lyne electorate will benefit from tax relief of up to $2,745 this year. We have extended the low and middle income tax offset, which means people receiving that will get a tax rebate when their tax returns go in of $1,080 if they're single or $2,160 if they are a couple. Because we have an economy now in regional Australia that's booming and we need more skilled workers, we've extended the JobTrainer fund. It'll support 500,000 new places around the nation to upskill jobseekers and young people. We already have 1,500 apprentices in Lyne, and these new measures will lead to improved opportunities for trainees and apprentices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other tax incentives in this budget are continuing the instant asset write-off for small businesses so those tradesmen can afford to get their new ute, their new trailer or their new piece of equipment because the value of it can be written off instantly against their tax liabilities. There's 4,300 businesses in Lyne that will be able to use the extended loss carry-back facility. That's where a loss this year can be carried back several years against your profit years so that you get a better tax refund. There are so many things that have helped businesses, particularly the tax-free cashflow boost, which has helped about 4,200 small businesses during the COVID pandemic. Because of that initiative, $167 million has come into the Lyne electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For investment in major infrastructure: what better than having $48 million from the federal coalition infrastructure budget to get the Harrington to Coopernook overpass built? This grade-separated interchange is a major necessity. It's a $60 million project, and there's $48 million coming from the federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The HomeBuilder program has helped a lot of housing construction in our electorate. The payments of $15,000 and $25,000 are being paid for out of this budget. Thirty-one thousand pensioners and 6,400 carers have received support payments of $1,250. This budget is how we have managed to pay for these things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other things benefiting us is all the new drugs on the PBS as well as extra funds for child care, preschools and aged care. There's more money for aged care; it has doubled from when I came in, in 2013. The Newcastle Airport upgrade of $66 million means all the people on the North Coast will have an international airport in Newcastle. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I have raised with the minister on many occasions a number of very, very important road projects in my electorate that deserve funding, but it appears, once again in this budget, that it has fallen on deaf ears. Of course one of the roads that I have raised in this place many times that needs an urgent upgrade is Majors Road.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Majors Road is a busy thoroughfare and is only set to become more congested with the planned upgrade of Glenthorne Farm and the adjoining soccer and BMX complexes. On top of the congestion on Majors Road, it is riddled with uneven surfaces and potholes, creating hazards for commuters. There is also a missed opportunity along Majors Road of not having an entry and exit onto the Southern Expressway, which could ensure that the residents of Sheidow Park, Trott Park, Hallett Cove, Flagstaff Hill and Aberfoyle Park could access the Southern Expressway, an important route into the city. This oversight means that many in our community travelling into the CBD miss out on the benefits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been calling on the federal government to fix Majors Road, including on and off ramps to the Southern Expressway, but we have seen nothing in this budget. Ian from Hallett Cove told me that he is worried that there will be a car accident, because of the unsafe driving conditions along Majors Road. Darryl from Hallett Cove said: 'I drive down Majors Road quite a lot. It has always been a bumpy road, and it is really dangerous. The road is only going to get busier with the national park opening up. I think that something should be done to improve it.' Darryl also told me that he would like to see an on-ramp and an off-ramp so that people in the southern suburbs can get onto the Southern Expressway. This belief is shared by many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The duplication of Commercial Road, including the duplication of the Saltfleet Street Bridge, is another example of a project that has been overlooked. Seaford is a fast-growing area in my electorate and home to many young families. The neighbouring suburb of Port Noarlunga is a busy tourist destination. Commercial Road is a main arterial road, and it needs to be duplicated. In addition, the extension of Doctors Road, which has not only been called for by residents but also by the local CFS station to ensure access can be made along this road, is critically important. These are just some of the road projects that electors in my electorate need but that have been neglected by this government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  I will take the opportunity later today to talk about our budget and the measures that will be impacting our community in Lindsay and the benefits to people in my community. But, before that, I really want to talk about how hard my community was impacted by the recent floods. I haven't had a chance to talk about this. I missed the last week of parliament to stay back with my community. It was a really traumatic time for many people. There were people who lost their livelihoods and lost all their belongings outside their homes as the floodwaters rose quite quickly. In some ways we were fortunate: the Nepean River didn't break its banks, as it may have done, which is what we were fearing, as bad as it would have been. There were homes along the river that were impacted, but it was the low-lying areas around towns like Londonderry that were really severely hit by the floods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge the families that are doing it tough out there. The Prime Minister and I visited the  Magnisalis family. They are a beautiful Greek family. They'd been living in their home for over 40 years. When we went and visited they had lost everything. All the members of their family were there, trying to clean out the house. It was quite extraordinary. It is really a testament to the community spirit in our area and also to this beautiful Greek family that they put on a lunch for us while they were still trying to clean out their homes. I'd like to thank them for their beautiful hospitality, and we'll stay in touch to make sure that the recovery efforts are going okay out in Londonderry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge the SES, who responded to thousands of calls during that time. The RFS were onboard to help with the clean-up as well. The PM also joined me at SES headquarters to receive a briefing. It was really quite extraordinary, on that first day, when we found out that the SES didn't have enough sandbags to protect local homes. All it took was a few phone calls to some local businesses and within an hour or so we had sand and we had more bags. I'd like to thank our local businesses who jumped in. Again, the community spirit was extraordinary, supporting people who were most in need across Lindsay during that time. I'd also like to acknowledge the Rapid Relief Team who came onboard throughout the week. They set up a sandbagging centre at Jamison Park, and they were going non-stop. They also supported our RFS and SES with a sausage sizzle, so there was food as the clean-up and recovery was happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't only the direct impact; businesses were impacted, too. As we recover, I want to let everyone across my community know that there's more work to do and I'll be with you all the way. Thank you. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

While some have been released, dozens remain, with no certainty about their future. They have never given up in their fight for justice, backed up by community members who turn out week after week in solidarity. I want to pay tribute today to the hundreds of community activists who've turned out day after day, week after week, to demand the release of these men and an end to indefinite detention, both in Australia and in the cruel offshore prisons of Manus and Nauru. I want to thank the 536 academics and researchers who have signed an open letter, not only demanding the release of the remaining men but demanding that our government fulfil its obligations under international law and abolish cruel temporary protection visas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Until both Liberal and Labor abandon the cruel, punitive policy of offshore detention and accept refugees, as is our international obligation, Australia can never claim to be a compassionate country on the world stage. Solidarity today and every day to the men, women and children held in cruel indefinite detention. We'll never stop fighting until this cruel policy ends and refugees are released.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the pandemic, many big corporations and billionaires made huge profits off the back of public handouts. Meanwhile, the number of people in this country on income support increased by 100 per cent to over 1.6 million people, and over two million people either didn't have a job or didn't have enough hours of work. After caving in to pressure, the government finally introduced the publicly funded JobKeeper wage subsidy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens support JobKeeper and support workers, but we don't support big businesses using it to increase their profits and line the pockets of their executives. At least 25 companies receiving JobKeeper also paid executive bonuses worth a combined total of $24.3 million, and 60 corporations recorded profits of over $8.6 billion in the last 18 months. Big businesses like Harvey Norman refused to pay even a single dollar of the over $20 million in JobKeeper—public handouts—that they received, despite doubling profits during the pandemic and paying executive bonuses. The Parliamentary Budget Office found that over $1 billion in JobKeeper payments was paid to profitable companies. Last night's budget revealed the government is cutting real support for higher education by over $1 billion. Let's make these billionaires and big corporations pay back the public subsidies they received despite making record profits and use it to make life better for everyone else.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  The future of Wide Bay is all about jobs in manufacturing—not in the old-school mass-production of labour-intensive goods but in the manufacturing of high-quality innovative products that can only be made by skilled Australian workers using state-of-the-art technology. In Wide Bay, with the support of $28 million, the Australian government has teamed up with Rheinmetall NIOA Munitions. This forging facility is taking shape rapidly. The RNM project is restoring Australia's sovereign capability in this critically important area, supporting our defence capability and creating around 100 ongoing jobs in the Maryborough area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also seeing innovation in the timber manufacturing sector, with DTM Timber opening a new production line in Maryborough for laminating timber products. The new equipment will enable the production of construction beams, posts, stair treads and flooring using shorter cuts of timber left over from DTM Timber's existing processing facility, turning waste into useful products. This is good news for the local economy and the environment. It reduces our reliance on imported timber and overseas suppliers, which is more important than ever as we recover from COVID-19. This $2.2 million project received around $1.1 million through the Australian government's Regional Jobs and Investment program. It has already created six jobs throughout construction and 10 permanent positions, and will support more ongoing jobs for years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Gympie, Nolan Meats injected $197 million into the Wide Bay economy last year through the procurement of cattle, and they employ more than one per cent of all people in Gympie. This is a 100 per cent family owned company. It's been in the region for more than 60 years, and they have a strong tradition of giving back to the community. They have their eyes firmly on the future, with some incredible tech at their meat processing facility. It was great to join with the Australian government's minister for agriculture and the Nolan family to officially open the $18 million expansion, which is creating new opportunities for local jobseekers, producers and export market chain suppliers. The Australian government has committed almost $5 million, through the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages, to this valuable project. It is already showing results—putting pay packets in the pockets of many hundreds of families around the local area, and supporting jobs for so many others.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  What I've known since coming to this parliament is that the Morrison government is big on announcements but poor on delivery. And we can see that nowhere more than on the bushfire ravaged New South Wales South Coast. I have been going around my communities and talking with them about what they would like to see to help bushfire-proof their communities. What they ask for is pretty simple. They want to be able to have good communications. They want to be able to have power so that they are not put in that situation again. The Durras Community Association got together in their very small but lovely community hall in February 2020. There were 150 residents and they put together a series of recommendations and questions to the government. They worked hard. They put in submissions to the bushfire commission. They came to me, and I wrote to the minister. All they wanted was a 145-metre-long aerial cable placed underground and to fix the mobile black spots along the Princes Highway between Batemans Bay and Ulladulla. So I wrote to the minister, and the response that I actually got—not from the minister but from his chief of staff—to be quite honest, was appalling. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has a $4 billion disaster mitigation fund, announced years ago, that it hasn't spent a cent of. The government announced the National Recovery and Resilience Agency, but Durras can't even get support to bushfire-proof their community. The president of the Durras Community Association was interviewed in the Eurobodalla local online <span style="font-style:italic;">Beagle</span>, and I want to read some of that today. It said: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Durras Community Association … is calling on the Commonwealth Government, especially the Minister for Communications, Paul Fletcher MP, to stop making excuses and start funding real on-ground actions to provide better bushfire protection for south coast communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">'The Durras community has asked for some specific simple communications upgrades to be funded to improve local resilience for bushfires and other emergencies but the response so far from governments, especially the Commonwealth has been absolutely pathetic' said the Association's President, Dr Trevor Daly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Durras Community Association wrote to Minister Fletcher in late 2020, but his office basically came back and said that they couldn't do anything. Then the association wrote to Minister Fletcher and invited him to the area, and Minister Fletcher has not agreed to that at all. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOWARTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Youth and Employment Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  As the local federal member for Petrie, I see the effort every day that goes into our comeback. Australia's greatest asset in securing our future prosperity is people, of course—the people we represent. Together with Petrie, they make up a nation that we're all proud of. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 70,600 taxpayers in Petrie will benefit from tax relief of up to $2,745 this year because of the Morrison government's tax relief plan. This is on top of the 76,700 people in Petrie that have already benefited. Small and medium-sized businesses are the backbone of our local Petrie community, and around 19,800 businesses in Petrie write off the full value of any eligible asset they purchase, and that really helps local businesses that supply them and, of course, the employees that work in those businesses. The budget will deliver a further benefit to 6,500 businesses in Petrie who will be able to use the extended loss carry-back measure to support cash flow and confidence during this global pandemic. To businesses like Isuzu and Big Rigs in the electorate, up in Burpengary East, this gives confidence to invest in local businesses and jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Boosting us towards future jobs and higher wages includes the government's modern manufacturing investments, tax incentives, and research and development support. This means businesses like Reid Print Technologies in Clontarf, which I recently visited, can innovate to the next level and collaborate with startups on R&amp;D and across industries. For example, they merged their tech into clothing, and it is now a wearable baby monitor to track the temperature and movement of the baby—just brilliant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Assistant Minister for Youth and Employment Services I met two young people just last week, Patrick and Ella, at Thor Building Products in Brisbane. Patrick and Ella are part of the nearly 145,000 commencements under the boosting Australian apprenticeships scheme. They said their jobs have given them security—a way to plan for their future. Patrick said he used to work as a casual but he now works full time and has security. So this scheme has helped with underemployment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the budget increases access to the First Home Super Saver Scheme, as well, from $30,000 to $50,000. This is reward for effort, but it gives those people wanting to break into the housing market an opportunity to do so—and there have been more first home buyers this year than in the last 12 years. It has never been a better time to reskill either, with the 1,025 apprenticeships that have started in Petrie. This has been expanded through JobTrainer nationwide, with 500,000 new places. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to mention aged care. My father-in-law died this week, on Monday, in aged care. He was looked after very well. But what the government has done to help aged care is really important. This will help our recovery.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  Right now one of the issues across my electorate is the proposal to build new transmission lines that will stretch about 120 kilometres, from Bulgana to north of Creswick right through to Melbourne's west. The towers built will stand at about the same height as the MCG towers. They are huge and they cut through both residential growth areas and some of the most productive agricultural land in the country. Not only is it productive land; it's an incredibly beautiful part of the world. While we do need the capacity to connect renewable energy into the electricity grid, the way it is being done is causing significant concerns across the community that I represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the start, AusNet's failure of communication and their lack of proper engagement with local people and, in particular, with local councils means that the community wasn't listened to and the unique aspect of the land being crossed was not understood. In meetings I've held with AusNet, the company contracted to build these lines, I have repeatedly raised the concerns of the community and called on those building the project to engage more meaningfully with the landholders and with local councils along the route. In particular, those behind the project should seriously consider the possibilities of going underground, particularly through highly bushfire prone areas. Whilst I understand there are costs associated with this, it would be better to deliver an outcome communities along the route can work with rather than the disruption that we're seeing currently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my role as local member, I have written to the Treasurer, the energy minister, the environment minister, the Victorian planning minister, AEMO and AusNet itself about various aspects of this proposal, from the problems with the RIT-T process through to the Foreign Investment Review Board requirements and the importance of protecting productive agricultural land. Most recently, I have held meetings with potato growers and producers. Our region produces around 75 per cent of the potatoes consumed in Australia. That's why I met last Monday with McCain to discuss how best they can assist in making sure that governments understand the concerns of our local potato growers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The planning process for this proposal does not take sufficient account of the loss of productive land should the overhead towers go ahead. There is a great deal of concern, particularly in those communities in my electorate but also in other parts of the electorate, about what that actually means. I do think that needs to be considered in the process. It is an issue that does need to be rectified. AusNet needs to do better. The Morrison and Andrews governments need to pay attention to this issue and make sure that those behind the project actually get it right. If they don't, they are jeopardising the social license for renewables in our regional and rural areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week two farmers put up a sign saying 'Where is Catherine King?' I can definitely and confidently say, 'Here I am, where I've always been: standing up for my community.'</span>

It was an emotional win for the team, as Cameron Hyde, a much-loved member of the club, passed away just a few days before the game. Cammo, as he was known, was a life member. He was instrumental in reviving the club and, indeed, coached the premier team to a victory in 2019. This was the first time the Souths had been in the grand final since 1993. A minute's silence was observed prior to the ANZAC Day Cup match, and his wife, Tara; and parents, Rod and Christine, presented the team with their winning medallions. Cammo was also a much-loved member of the St John's College Woodlawn community. He was a teacher who had a passion for connecting with students and helping them achieve their best. I extend my and, indeed, the community's thoughts to his wife, Tara; daughter, Lennie; parents, Rod and Christine; and his siblings, Karina and Brenton, and their families. May he rest in peace.</span>

Phoenix won the eight-and-under mixed division, which made him the youngest champion at the competition. He scored a heat total of 10.6, which is obviously a great score. His parents, Hayley and Michael, and brother, Archie, are naturally very proud of his efforts. His mum, Hayley, who was recently named the Clarence Valley Citizen of the Year, missed one of Phoenix's qualifiers as she was the guest speaker at my school leaders event in Grafton, where she spoke to the leaders about her solo kayak down the Clarence River. It was a very inspirational talk. Phoenix also won the Woolworths Surfer Groms Comp back in September 2020. He is certainly a young surfer with a big future ahead of him. Sage Lewis from Sandy Beach competed, and he came second to Phoenix in the under-eight mixed category. Congratulations to them both.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The legacy of the Liberal government is flat wages for eight years at the same time as we have had housing prices and the cost of housing in this country skyrocket—flat wages and the price of housing increasing. The gap in housing affordability has never been bigger in the history of Australia. It is harder to get into the housing market now than it has ever been in the history of our great country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it important that Australians can get into the housing market? Because, if you retire, your net worth on average—the median net worth of people who are able to get into the housing market in Australia—is $980,000 in assets if you're able to have some sort of property asset in this country, but, if you don't, that number is $40,000. It is a great wealth creator in this country. Housing and property is a great way for Australians to find financial security in retirement. But, under this government, what we have seen is that fewer and fewer Australians are able to have this opportunity in their working lives to secure their financial future and to be able to retire with the amount of financial security that Australians deserve. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who is this affecting the most? It is affecting Australian women. The fastest-growing cohort of homeless Australians is women over 55. If you look at some of the structural inequalities in our economy, it is clear to see what is driving that. Women are working for less. The gender pay gap has not been closed under this government. They are working in lower-paid industries more generally—services based industries—and they are also taking breaks from the workforce. They're doing more than their fair share of looking after kids and also caring responsibilities. Australian women are doing more than men in caring for families and taking breaks from their employment, which means superannuation is being reduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's this government's response to some of the structural inequalities, with flatlining wages and women being unable to get into the housing market or to find safe and secure housing? This government says, 'We're not even going to try and fix wages flatlining.' We saw last night in the budget that this government is content with flat wages over the forward estimates. They don't want to see wages increase. They don't want the gap in what Australians earn and what they can afford in housing to close. What this government has presided over is a widening of that gap in what Australians can afford and what Australians are earning and the cost of housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when it comes to superannuation, what do they desperately want you to do? They want you to raid your superannuation to put it into housing. What that's going to do is bump up the cost of housing, and it's also going to leave more and more Australians, especially Australian women, with less retirement savings when they retire. Housing affordability is a crisis in this country. But as more and more people are unable to enter the housing market, it's pushing them into the rental market. The cost of renting is becoming more and more in this country. Forty per cent of renters are paying more than 30 per cent of their income on rent, which is causing financial stress. Australians are paying more than they can afford, to live in the rental market. This is a real problem, because at the other end of the scale, in the social housing market, less than one per cent of people on the JobSeeker allowance can afford to be in the private rental market. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government last night talked about all of these incentive programs: 'Look how well we're doing on housing affordability.' What they are doing is a drop in the ocean. There are 200,000 people in Australia on the social housing waitlist. There are hundreds of thousands of Australians facing rental stress. Less than 40 per cent of people at the age of 30 can get into the housing market. Housing affordability under this government is becoming a crisis. It has never been less affordable in the history of our country to get into the housing market. And what we're seeing is more of the same, more of the same marketing and spin. What we need is to attack supply, attack the problem of the number of houses out there and make housing more affordable for everyday Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I thank the member for Macnamara for starting this important debate. Housing is a significant part of Australia's identity. While the American dream aspires to high office, wealth and independence, the humbler Australian dream is just a block of land that you can call home, your castle. It is not a coincidence that the Menzies years, which were remembered as the halcyon days after the war, when Australia finally stood on its own two feet, are also years that prioritised home ownership and saw home ownerships rise to their highest levels ever—our foundation of common wealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those years are far behind us now, and every year the number of homeowners shrinks compared to investors. Headlines across the media are discussing the huge rises we have seen in recent weeks, and real estate websites and their affiliate newspapers are rejoicing as the records tumble every week. But behind every headline celebrating a suburb's record being beaten there are dozens of aspiring first home buyers, once again going home empty handed, redoing their sums to see how much more they must save to have a chance at homeownership. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only a year ago that many were predicting house prices could fall by up to 30 per cent. The dream of first home buyers was within grasp again, but now it is further away than ever. Initially, the boom was led by homeowners, specifically first home buyers. That was fine, but sadly those days are behind us. Data released last week shows that in the past month alone investors were up 12.7 per cent and first home buyers fell by 0.9 per cent. Interest rates are at record lows and the cheap money is fuelling these price rises. Back in 2019 interest rates were at a record low too, and we saw exactly the same outrageous growth at that time. As long as interest rates are below rental returns, investors continue to flood into the market, and while support grants are exceptionally healthy they address symptoms not the cause. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gallingly, strong house prices are being cited as an economic stimulant, responsible in part for the economic confidence we are feeling right now. Housing is the wealth effect that encourages Australians to spend and keep the economy moving, which is why regulators are reticent to act. Soon we will see that the price has been worse than the result and we'll wish we had acted sooner. We'll wish that we had acted now. It is not hard, as we know what to do. We've done it before. It was in 2019, during the greatest-ever growth in housing prices. APRA stepped in and brought curbs to investors, like enforcing a 20 per cent deposit for investors. This, in part, did the trick and soon prices were having the sort of measured decline that was so needed. Unfortunately, in a market that rarely falls, this downturn scared many, and by the time COVID had reared its ugly head the reforms were scrapped. Why can't APRA bring this back? Why does this have to be a binary on-or-off option? Why not allow loan-to-value ratios to fluctuate, set on a monthly level like the interest rates are? Investors could be incentivised or disincentivised to join or leave the market, and this adjustable lever could offset the incentives inadvertently created by interest rate reductions. Housing should not be an asset to make a quick buck. It needs to have solid foundations and to prioritise those who need shelter over those who wish to get rich. Curbing investors, to the benefit of home owners, may impact some, but, inherently, the only people it hurts are already fortunate, and it's to the benefit of those who really do need help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear from the statements in the budget last night that housing is a priority of this government, which is great news. The support for first home buyers is necessary and will help those who receive it. But I have concerns that, for as long as interest rates remain this low, more structural change will be needed before we can really have confidence that our housing market is delivering for the people that need it most.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  I am very pleased to rise to speak to the motion moved by the member for Macnamara, which really highlights the crisis in access to safe, secure and affordable housing in Australia. The issue has never been so critical. This is not the first time I've had to speak in this chamber about the dire state of housing in Australia, and I know it's not going to be the last.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I met with the women's crisis centres in my electorate of Newcastle. Those fearless women who have been running those centres for decades now told me that it has never been so bad. Thirty-five years of experience, one worker had, and she looked me straight in the eye and said, 'Sharon, it is dire.' Heartbreakingly, their key message to me was that, as I said, the housing crisis for vulnerable people is the worst they've ever seen it and that there is absolutely nowhere for those women to go. Those crisis centres are maxed out for accommodation. There are waiting lists for social housing in Newcastle extending for more than eight years now, and the private market has utterly failed vulnerable families. It is so bad that, when women escaping family violence present to these centres in Newcastle, if they arrive in a car the centres are secretly rejoicing because they know that at least that woman can sleep in her car for the foreseeable future, because God knows that's where she's going to be. There is nowhere for her to go. This is an unacceptable state of affairs for this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The housing crisis in Newcastle is dire not just for vulnerable people now. Even families on two incomes are finding themselves rendered homeless. Rental vacancy rates have dropped as low as 0.3 per cent in parts of our region this year, and homeless services have been completely overwhelmed. I was recently contacted by a young couple in my electorate who, in June of last year, were evicted from their rental property, as the owner wanted to do renovations. They received their eviction notice. They immediately started applying for rental properties in Newcastle. After three months, they'd had zero success but had to move out of their property nonetheless. They moved in with their grandparents for another six months as they continued to apply for properties, again with no success. Circumstances changed for their grandparents and they couldn't stay there any longer, so they now live in a tent in a caravan park. This is a couple who are both in full-time work, in hospitality and health. This is the changing face of the housing crisis in Australia. There are too many stories like this couple's. The private rental market in Newcastle has failed. People are offering months of rent upfront and giving landlords an additional 50 or 60 bucks a week, on top of what they're asking, in order to secure a property. So, as you could well imagine, that means anyone on income support or in a vulnerable state has not a hope in hell of competing in that kind of market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night's budget did nothing to address the housing crisis we are facing and the fundamental lack of affordable housing in this nation. There were announcements like the family home guarantee to help single parents buy a house, but this will only help 2,500 a year of the one million single parents in Australia, with the government only investing a measly $300,000 a year. You heard me—I'm not talking about millions of dollars; I'm talking about $300,000 from the Commonwealth of Australia. That's the support single parents are getting from this government to enter the housing market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians need the Morrison government to take some responsibility now. I am sick of listening to this government say: 'Housing? That's a state and territory matter. We don't have anything to do with that.' Well, you know what? If you want to see a productive nation, you've got to make sure your citizens are housed in safe, secure and affordable housing; otherwise, they cannot participate in this economy. They don't get to be productive citizens of our nation, and we cannot afford to lock those people out. We've got very good social reasons for why we want to house people, but goddamn there are some strong economic reasons as well. Never has housing been less affordable in this nation, and never has a government been less interested. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Malcolm Gladwell says that, when good people meet bad environments, the environment always wins. Mr Burns is a good person, and this motion is a very, very bad motion. The fact of the matter is that the Labor Party cry tears for those who cannot afford or find housing, but they do everything they possibly can to make sure that that's the way it stays. This motion starts off talking about home ownership but ends up demanding that government owns people. You should be ashamed of yourselves for putting this motion up.

The number of rough sleepers has dropped by 80 per cent in the past 20 years. Switzerland gives local governments fiscal incentives to allow housing developments and helps people buy houses by increasing supply. This is what this country needs. This is what Australians need—not more social housing or more planning by central government. What this country needs is more Australians owning more of their own houses. It needs planning reform. It needs to move from stamp duty to land tax. We need to have value sharing, as the member for Bennelong pointed out, so that we align infrastructure with where we're making developments.</span>

They found that 68 per cent of the cost of an apartment—and I'm looking at you two, the member for Macnamara and the member for Dunkley, about this—is due to zoning laws. It's not due to a lack of social housing. It's not due to a lack of subsidies. It's due to zoning laws. Where is that in your motion, Josh? Where? It's nowhere.

And the fastest-growing cohort of homeless Australians are older women—that is, women over the age of 55. The government's response in this budget has been minimum help and maximum hype.

                  </a>  You weren't talking about real people. This is a speech about people from my community. This is a speech about Lisa from Langwarrin, who emailed me. I've spoken to her. She's 49 years old. She's a single mother of three. Her youngest son is 14. Lisa has two jobs. She works full-time for the council and she works between 10 and 20 hours a week as a disability support worker. A divorce bled her savings dry. By the time the divorce was over, she had no savings and the house that she'd bought in 2003 was gone. Her husband owes her tens of thousands of dollars in child support but they can't obtain it because he's self-employed and his tax returns say he doesn't earn enough money. She has to pay $2,000 a month in rent to have a home near her son's school in Langwarrin that's decent enough that she feels she can be proud enough to bring them up in it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She has said to me that she's at the mercy of her landlord all the time. The landlord can change their mind and say they don't want to continue the lease. And she's at the mercy of her job continuing. If something happens with her job, she is one month away from being homeless. The only safety net she has is her long service leave. She cannot save enough money for a mortgage. She cannot buy a house. That's what she wants for herself, for her retirement, and for her sons and her family. That's what my speech is about: Lisa from Langwarrin and all the other Lisas out there, who are hardworking, decent people who cannot afford to live decently in this country at the moment because of the cost of housing and the cost of rent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My friend and colleague the member for Macnamara recently published a report with McKell called <span style="font-style:italic;">The crumbling Australian dream</span>. One of the things he talked about in that report which is fundamentally important is that we don't consider housing a human right in this country.</span>

                  </a>  We do not have a charter of rights. The member opposite says that's not true. I'd like him to point me to the federal charter of rights. We are signed up to international conventions that say housing is a human right. We do not have a federal bill of rights in this country which people can rely on in order to make their government provide housing as a human right. Other jurisdictions around the world do this but Australia doesn't.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many things that we need to fix in this country so that people like Lisa and her sons can have security now and so Lisa can have security in retirement. Raiding her superannuation, as Lisa said to me, is not one of the responses. In Lisa's own words, that will leave her retiring without enough to live on. There are structural things that we need to do. We need to invest in social housing and we need to treat housing in this country as a basic human right. It's part of the reason why in my first speech and at every opportunity I have pushed for the need to have a charter of human rights at the federal level in this country so that rights and responsibilities are more than just words; they are things that governments have to uphold.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  What an important topic here. It's hard not to agree with each speaker. It's also a shame that we can't come to some agreement on the important matter of emergency housing, because obviously it involves every level of government. I want to acknowledge the mover of the motion today, who has probably thought more deeply about this problem than anyone in the chamber. I congratulate him on the recent work that he has done. He did promise to send me a copy of the report, although I'm still waiting to receive it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker, from the other side of the chamber, makes a fair point about the human right to housing, which I think at a grassroots level, certainly in my electorate, is fully understood, but she is right to point out that this should perhaps be more clearly pointed out. As is someone on my side of the chamber, who makes the very obvious point that, ultimately, supply of housing is the long-term solution but we can't rely on that in isolation to solve the problem, because it is so complex. In the end, three levels of government have to do what they can in their own remit to fix the problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's sad that this debate is so ideologically lignified, because we need to admit that each one of us can do more and all governments can do more, as should every MP. In my own electorate of Bowman I have committed that no resident should live without a roof over their head. It's a fundamental acknowledgement of the human right to housing. But in reality what can a federal government do apart from the financial reforms that make lending more possible to those who need it most?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was August 2018 when Caroline Rozario, a former staffer of mine, walked into my office and asked, 'What is this coalition government doing to make home ownership an aspirational and possible goal for young Australians of my age?' She put it to me to write a one-pager on a deposit assistance scheme, which was submitted to Treasury and the Assistant Treasurer in August 2018, and a few months later announced by the Prime Minister as the only significant flagship policy for the 2019 campaign launch. On that Mother's Day weekend, the Prime Minister made the obvious point of the power, security and certainty that home ownership confers. It should be an objective of all levels of government. Since that time, the initial 10,000 has grown to 30,000 Australian families who would otherwise be renting but now own their own home and have been delivered what the previous member, the member for Dunkley, was crying out for: certainty not just for vulnerable parents but also for their children to know that they cannot be evicted on the whim of a malicious landlord.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That certainty through home ownership is important, but I'm not going to stand here today and say it's the complete solution. I will certainly say that an extension of my deposit assistance scheme policy announced last night in the budget, conferring upon 10,000 single parents, for up to a certain sized mortgage, the ability to borrow 98 per cent of the cost of a home, liberates a huge cohort of Australians who otherwise could never dream of having their own house to have one. I tell you what, this cohort will demonstrate exactly what the previous 30,000 have in the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme: an extremely low rate of loan failure. That rate, below 0.5 of one per cent, is not really different to the overall market as it stands at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This deposit assistance scheme was I think a big change, but I'm never going to stand here and say that it's a solution for highly vulnerable, almost homeless families, who will always rely on the provision of social housing, That is something I'd encourage the Labor MP who moved this motion to take to Labor governments—not have a debate like this but just fix the problem with more social housing, and broaden their stock. I'm not going to say it's their fault. I'm going to say that they should go to all state governments so they can work on stock for those who are in and out of homelessness, just as this government works to bring the threshold of home ownership down to solve an equivalently important problem, and that is the challenge that those who can otherwise service a mortgage with their eyes closed are prevented from achieving the dream of home ownership, purely through mortgage insurance and the creation of a large deposit requirement that is otherwise utterly unnecessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will stand here today and be measured on my words in 12 months time, that those single parents benefiting from the Treasurer's announcement last night of a two per cent deposit will be living in those homes—12 months from now, five years from now. That is something to which they could never otherwise have aspired without the policies of this federal government and the opportunities that we deliver at the Commonwealth level in order to do our part to ameliorate what is otherwise a significant housing crisis that has perennially been the responsibility of state governments.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144732" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I rise in very strong support of the motion by the member for Macnamara in relation to housing and also want to congratulate him on the excellent work he's been doing in this area. The great Australian dream is something that all of us have grown up with—the idea that one day, with a bit of hard work, we might own our own home. It's an aspiration that, no matter our political persuasions, no matter our background, we all share. It makes sense, too. Safe and secure housing is the basis for everything else. It should be seen as a human right in this country, and I echo the words of the member for Dunkley in her speech about this previously. Safe and secure housing allows you to have a sense of independence, a connection with your community and a place that is yours, in good and bad times. Nothing has brought that message home more strongly than going through COVID in the past 18 months. People's homes became places where they could be in lockdown, where they could be safe. The pandemic really highlighted, in a range of ways, the risk to people who don't have secure housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For our children's generation, though, I'm genuinely not sure that this great Australian dream will be achievable. In fact, with rising housing prices, it isn't achievable for most young Australians today. Australia is in the midst of a housing affordability crisis, one that this government have failed to act on in any way, and their latest budget, last night, is a clear example of this. Rates of home ownership continue to decline. Housing stock is at an all-time low and rents at an all-time high. We have enormous social housing waitlists, and on top of that a growing number of Australians are facing homelessness. For far too many Australians, the idea of owning a home is now completely unachievable. For 43 per cent of Australia's low-income earners, over 30 per cent of their income goes into paying rent and keeping a roof over their heads. When you're paying over a third of your income for housing you are officially in rental stress. When you're paying that much for rent, how are you supposed to even begin to save for a deposit, especially when the government has forecast no wage growth?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem here in Canberra is particularly serious. If your only income is a disability support pension, JobSeeker or youth allowance, there are no affordable private rentals in the ACT—none. Less than five per cent of accommodation on the market in the ACT is classified as affordable. Canberra is now the most expensive city in Australia to rent in—not Sydney, not Melbourne, but Canberra. To its credit, the ACT government are working extremely hard to address these issues, but they can't do it alone. They're investing in more social housing, providing more rental subsidies to those in public housing and opening up more parcels of land for development. But it might be nice if the federal government could help out.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all its spending announced in yesterday's budget, the government has done essentially nothing to address the housing crisis. Australia currently has a shortage of 400,000 social housing properties. The Treasurer could have stood up last night and said, 'The government will fund the construction of social housing Australia wide.' Did he do that? No, he didn't. Instead, the government are putting their fingers in their ears and screaming, 'I don't hold a hammer, mate.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did they actually announce when it comes to housing? The government announced the Family Home Guarantee, a scheme that will allow single parents to put down a two per cent deposit on a home loan. This entire policy will cost the budget a grand total of $300,000. Not $300 million, even—$300,000. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have people in here like the member for Goldstein who would have all of us raid our super accounts to put down a deposit. That is not a solution. It's just the creation of another problem where we allow people to rob their own retirement savings to try to have secure housing. We need to urgently address the worsening housing crisis in Australia. It's abundantly clear that the only way we can do this is to elect a bold, ambitious Labor government that's not afraid to take on the big issues. The Liberals have absolutely abrogated their responsibility to make our lives better, and they don't deserve your vote.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMMONDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I rise to speak against the motion, in particular the convoluted claims by my friend the member for Macnamara. I won't reach the rhetorical flourishes of previous speakers from our side of the chamber, but the member for Macnamara is absolutely wrong when he suggests that the Morrison government is not assisting Australians to buy their first home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, we believe very much in lower taxes and supporting young Australians to enter the property market. The ability to purchase your own home is so vital to your future, to the future of your family and to your financial stability. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, borders were closed, business revenue collapsed, many Australians lost their jobs and we were very conscious, as a government, about the handbrake this could put on young Australian families who are wanting to get into their own home. So the government acted swiftly and decisively to implement targeted measures to ensure that Australians wishing to buy their own home were not left behind. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to pay tribute to the incredibly successful HomeBuilder scheme. It goes to show how those Labor MPs who have spoken on this motion absolutely have their blinkers on. They cannot acknowledge the success of this particular program. It has not just achieved what we said it would and what the government set out to achieve; it has been an absolute, runaway success in terms of generating construction, creating supply so that people can get into the housing market and creating jobs for tradies—so much so that it's almost hard to get a tradie at the moment, because they are so full up with work. In my electorate of Ryan we have a number of local construction businesses. I got to meet with a few of them, and one of them in particular with the Minister for Housing and Assistant Treasurer, Minister Sukkar. A couple of families had both received the $25,000 in HomeBuilder grants. Lloyd Payne, the general manager of Fresh Homes, a local construction business, gave us a tour of the new builds that were happening for these young families. Lloyd was quick to comment that HomeBuilder had changed the typical profile of first home buyers, and that there was a substantial increase in first home buyers approaching their business and utilising the grant to get into the property market for the first time—to get onto that very important first rung on the ladder to financial success. Lloyd said, as somebody who has been in the construction industry for over 30 years, that he has seen 'nothing better than this program, in terms of helping a first home owner get into their first home'. Due to its success, the budget includes a 12-month extension of the HomeBuilder construction commencement period for existing applicants. I think that should be warmly welcomed by both sides of the chamber. It's certainly welcomed by this side of the chamber. If those opposite, the Labor members we have heard speak, were genuine in their desire to see people in new homes, they would understand the challenge that has to be tackled in creating supply and they would recognise that the HomeBuilder program does that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe in lower taxes to help young families get ahead. Previous speakers have talked about families' difficulties in saving deposits for their first home. Well then, back our tax cuts, which allow them to keep more of the money that they have earnt in their pocket to spend on their first home. It's not rocket science. Yet those on the other side of the chamber will demand that more money be taken from young families by the government, because Labor always think they know how to spend your money better than you do. Yet at the same time they will decry the fact that it is too hard for these families to save for first home deposits. It's just another example of not only their hypocrisy but how they will have a bob each way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our budget will also increase the maximum amount of voluntary contributions that can be released under the First Home Super Saver Scheme from $30,000 to $50,000, again providing another opportunity for young families to kickstart their home deposit and get onto that important first rung. We are doing an enormous amount to get people into their first homes. I can't reject the member for Macnamara's motion more, and I support the government's efforts on first home buyers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has protected lives and livelihoods throughout the COVID crisis and now, as a government, we're ensuring a strong economic recovery. Changing attitudes around women returning to work after having children, along with improved access to child care, have increased women's participation in the workforce to record highs. As the Treasurer said, we want more Australians in jobs. In jobs, there is a dignity, there is a meaning and there is a purpose, and that should be open to both men and women equally. One of the ways we are doing this is by protecting and improving child care. By lifting barriers, we help reduce the disincentives for women and men to participate in the workforce to the full extent they choose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When a family welcomes a baby, it's an incredibly exciting and sometimes turbulent time. To have the freedom of choice on how they care for their new family empowers parents—freedom to balance their new responsibilities without sacrificing their career or their precious time with their children. Perhaps a parent would like to undertake study or further training while caring for their children. Perhaps they'd like to go back to work for an extra day or two a week as their children grow. This is an incredibly important time in young parents' careers as they're aspiring to a better life. As my adult children are leaving university and entering the workforce, they are looking for opportunities, and these opportunities weren't available to people of my generation. When I was building my career and having babies, there was no maternity leave and there was no childcare subsidy. I also, unfortunately, didn't have the benefit of grandmothers who were alive to help us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud of the commitment that our government has made to preserving family choice. As part of the budget announced last night, our government has announced an additional $1.7 billion to further help Australian families with the cost of child care. This will further encourage workforce participation for both men and women at an aspiring time of their careers. As part of the budget, our government has announced, starting on 1 July 2022, an increase in the childcare subsidies available to families with more than one child aged five and under in child care. This will benefit around 250,000 families across Australia. For those with more than one child in child care, the level of subsidy received will increase by 30 per cent, to a maximum subsidy of 95 per cent of fees paid for their second and subsequent children. This is akin to saying, 'Let's get out there and have more kids!' It's fantastic news. I remember the baby bonus of the Howard-Costello years, when we were encouraged to have more children. These changes will ensure half of Australian families receive a 95 per cent subsidy for the second child and subsequent children. Secondly, the annual cap of $10,560 for families earning over $189,000 will be removed for all families. This investment builds on $10.3 billion that the government is already investing in child care this year. By increasing the childcare subsidy for families with two or more children, we'll help support the choices of working Australian families. This is a targeted investment that makes child care more affordable. It increases workforce participation and will boost the Australian economy by up to $1.5 billion per year, an incredibly important productivity measure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our measures that are in place will truly open the door for those choosing to work or to work more. The measures will help women who want to have a second child return to work so they can continue to progress their own careers and contribute to Australia's economy. Our new measures in place will have three-quarters of subsidies going to families earning under $150,000. Our support is targeted and goes to those who need it most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Child care is not just a vital sector of our economy, it is a vital sector for each and every family. That's why we've protected, that's why we're strengthening it, and that's why I'm proud to be a member of a government that is investing so well in the childcare sector for the good of all families of Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E09" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  When the member for Higgins says the government is protecting child care, I have to ask, 'Who are they protecting child care from?' Let's look at the record of this government when it comes to child care. Since the coalition was elected, in 2013, childcare fees have skyrocketed by 35.9 per cent—close to 40 per cent. And what have they done about it? They've done some smoke-and-mirrors stuff along the way but nothing that has changed things for women seeking to return to work and maintain and develop their place in the workforce in the long-term—nothing. Nor does the budget announcement last night do anything in the long term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the history a little bit. We heard from the Prime Minister about the once-in-a-generation reform of child care in the lead-up to the 2016 election. This government has a pattern of cutting in the first two years of a term and then spending big in the last year of a term—spending big in the year before an election but cutting in the first two years of a term. In the year before the 2016 election, they announced a major childcare reform. Prime Minister Morrison was the minister then. They didn't actually do it in 2016. They talked about it a bit more and made a few iterations. They introduced the legislation in 2017, two years later, and in 2018, in the year before an election, they introduced a once-in-a-generation reform of child care for the women of Australia—and men, by the way, because both parents have to wear the responsibility of looking after children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It took the government three years to deliver it. They announced it just before an election and delivered it before the next election—and, 2½ years after they delivered it, this once-in-a-generation reform has made no difference to ongoing childcare costs. In fact, women are worse off now than they were then because childcare fees are rising much, much higher than CPI or wages. And the government's own predictions for the years following this budget say exactly that. Documents from the Department of Education predict that childcare fees will increase by an average of 4.1 per cent every year for the next four years but they are only indexed to CPI.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there we go, the promises that the government are promising now are still temporary—and they're very, very, very narrow. You have to have more than one child in child care, and you get the increase for your second child—your second child, not the first one—and you lose the increase for your second child when your first child goes to school. The day they go to school, you lose it completely. And it doesn't come into effect for another year anyway. It doesn't come into effect for another year. So, if you have a five-year-old and a three-year-old now, forget it. By the time it comes in—zip, zero. If you have a three-year-old and a two-year-old, you'll get it maybe for a year and a half, or two if you're lucky. That's it. Then it's gone. Again, because it's indexed at CPI and fees are going up, it's a bit like bracket creep; it's going to wipe out the benefit for every parent in just a few years, just like the government's last childcare announcement did. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing long term about this government. It also does absolutely nothing—nothing—for workplace participation. I have a person in my electorate who told me that they pay more on childcare fees than they do on their mortgage. It does nothing for parents once the child goes to school. Yet any of us that know people who have children of school age know how difficult after-school-hour and vacation care is and how expensive it is, and how complex the lives of working parents are if their children are in the childcare system. as the vast majority are. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know, because woman after woman after woman is telling us, that they lose money if they go to work on their fourth day. We the taxpayers contribute to their education, we help them go to university, we invest all that money in their training, and then they have children and suddenly it costs them money to go to work. So their work is maybe three days but not four or five. It halts their career, it's a waste of their investment and ours. It doesn't allow them to flourish. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This announcement by this government is a sham. Protecting child care? They should protect it from themselves, quite frankly.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281513" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  As a mum who has three children who went through child care before school, I know how important it is for working families and also for early years learning and school readiness. That's why I'm so pleased that, as we emerge from the coronavirus pandemic and look ahead, we're further supporting families, including families in my electorate of Lindsay, through our childcare initiatives in the 2021 budget. From childcare investments to more funding for preschool education, we the Morrison government are investing in families and our kids. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am, as I said, passionate about this. But it's not just me saying this. I have childcare centres contacting me, and parents as well. Denise from Meek's Preschool &amp; Early Learning Centre in Berkshire Park told me that this is a win-win for parents and their children, who will continue to receive great preschool learning opportunities in a safe and nurturing environment, whilst also helping hundreds of parents who would otherwise have to not work. So it's a win for families and a win for the economy. These reforms will enable around 40,000 parents to work an extra day each week and will boost GDP by up to $1.5 billion per year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that this will particularly support women in work. When I worked at the US Studies Centre, heading up a women in leadership initiative, women's workforce participation was one of the key things that we looked at and had issues with, and a lot of it came down to the availability and the affordability of child care as women had to leave the workforce to have children and then re-enter the workforce and continue their career paths. We have marked a record-high women's workforce participation of 61.5 per cent, and, by removing those disincentives, those barriers, we're further supporting women returning to work or taking those additional hours. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that these hours are so important as someone in an outer-metro seat, where people have to travel into work an hour each day. Over 300,000 people travel out of Western Sydney each day. Having affordable and accessible child care is so important for families in Lindsay. Denise said it best, I think: it is a win-win for all of us. We're also removing the $10,560 annual cap on the childcare subsidy, which will benefit around 18,000 families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our investment in this budget to further support parents to get back into work or increase their hours is focused on low- and middle-income-earning families. Around half of the families set to benefit will have a household income of under $130,000. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our budget is building on the existing support we are providing for women to enter the workforce, including the $9.7 billion in annual childcare support and $2.3 billion in annual paid parental leave. These childcare initiatives are delivering targeted support where it's needed most. Already the average out-of-pocket cost is less than $4 an hour, and more than a quarter of families pay less than $2 an hour. When I speak with childcare centres and parents across my community, they feel this is absolutely reasonable and they support it. When you speak to people, you find out the truth. The hourly fee cap we introduced is working to keep downward pressure on fees, with 87.5 per cent of centre based day care services charging under the hourly rate cap. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our preschool package will see more than $2 billion invested over the next four years. That will provide long-term stability and certainty for the early education sector, because we know that preschool learning leads to better educational outcomes later in life and helps children succeed before they begin school. I really do know the importance of this preschool education, having been employed by a playgroup, over a number years, many years ago when my children were young. This funding commitment will support access for all children to at least 15 hours a week of quality learning in the year before school. All children should have access to high quality early childhood education, regardless of their circumstances. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister and the Minister for Women have said, this budget statement provides a $3.4 billion investment towards promoting values so that women right across our country can be economically secure. This is absolutely what this budget does. It reflects the responsibility we have towards the social and cultural diversity of Australian women and ensures that opportunities and protections are available to all women.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  Access to affordable and quality child care is certainly something that Australian families rightly expect, and it is something that I will continue to advocate for in this place. To hear members opposite claim that last year, during the pandemic, the Morrison government backed the early education sector just could not be further from the truth. I know this because I was in contact with early education providers, educators and parents throughout both of the lockdowns in Victoria last year. The overwhelming message I received from them was one of uncertainty and feeling like they had been hung out to dry by this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget, early childhood educators were in the one sector that this government removed JobKeeper from early. This was from a government that says it gets it now, that it understands women. Let's remember that 96 per cent of early educators are women. Removing JobKeeper payments from this sector, singling out this profession that predominantly employs women, when this pandemic was already hitting them hardest, was just cruel. The early education sector was and is an essential service. It is these educators who are looking after our children. They are on the front lines. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During COVID and the lockdowns, I spent a lot of time talking with them. I must say, I'm so surprised to hear this motion praising the Morrison government for its efforts with this sector, in COVID, moved by a fellow member from Melbourne. Who was the member for Higgins talking to during lockdown? It certainly was not the early childhood educators who'd had their payments ripped away from them. It's really disappointing to hear that fellow members from Melbourne are so out of touch with their communities and so out of touch with the needs of these vital workers, our early childhood educators. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've just come from meeting with early childhood educators, and they are devastated about last night's budget. They are worried about the future of their sector. The reality is that their pay and conditions—the pay of this largely female workforce—are nowhere near enough to match their skill level and the demands that are put upon them. There was nothing in this Morrison government budget to fix that. There was nothing to lift the wages of these vital workers, to lift the wages of early childhood educators. That means that too many of these workers will leave the sector. That means that families lose out, and that means that our children lose out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what did the government announce in this budget? Well, the first and perhaps most important point to note is that what they did announce around child care won't be implemented until July 2022. Australian families—families in my community—are looking for support now. They need support now, to reduce the unacceptably high cost of childcare fees. If we are genuine about supporting women to get back into the workforce as part of this COVID recovery, we need this relief from childcare fees now. The other big issue with what was announced by the Morrison government is that it benefits only families that have two children in child care. This is a subsidy for some families but not for others. Families right across the country, families right across my community, are struggling with the cost of child care, whether they've got two children or one child. It is just so expensive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During this debate we've heard a lot about personal experiences. Well, I have one child who is in child care and another child who will soon enter child care. I have a lot of what I call 'swing conversations'. These are conversations you have in the playground while you're pushing your kid on the swing and you chat to the mum who is pushing her kid on the swing next to you. I can tell you, time and time again those women pushing their children on the swings explain to me how they can't afford to go back to work because the cost of child care just doesn't make it worth it for them. And this package does nothing to change that. It means they won't be able to go back to work and know they can securely pay for child care for their children. It means they might not be able to pick up that extra couple of days. They will be the ones continuing to work part-time, to pick up the extra care, because this package does not solve the underlying problems of the cost of child care in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian families want better. Families in my community—those mums I'm talking to at the swings—want better. They want a well-funded early education sector. They want the workers in the sector to be paid as they should be. They want to know, when they send their kids to child care, that they can afford it, that the workers who are looking after them are supported and that there's a secure future for everyone there. That's not what we're getting from this government. What we're getting is a sham.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  As a woman who worked while raising two wonderful children, I understand the burden of juggling both professional life and family. I understand how it must have been for many Victorian women who had to juggle work responsibilities and home schooling during the height of the COVID pandemic. Thankfully, though, many of our frontline working mothers—the doctors, nurses, police and carers—were still able to access the key childcare support they needed in order to keep Australia safe. The Morrison government invested $3 billion into early childhood support and care during COVID-19 so that the families who needed care the most could get it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it worked. We saw childcare attendance rebound by mid-December, with a seven per cent increase from pre-COVID levels and a 3.5 per cent increase from 2019 figures; 93 per cent of surveyed parents could access all the child care they needed in November 2020. And now quality, affordable child care is available for families because of the continued efforts of the Morrison government. The government that I'm proud to be a part of has a proven track record of delivering affordable child care year in, year out. The average out-of-pocket cost is less than $4 an hour, bringing the cost down considerably. More than a quarter of families also pay less than $2 an hour out of pocket. Our child care has become more accessible for those who need it, bringing the families of an additional 280,000 children some sorely needed financial relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government recognises the tangible link between affordable child care and women's workforce participation. The Morrison government's childcare subsidy is supporting women's workforce participation to a record 61.8 per cent. This government's commitment to families extends into the 2021-22 budget, too. As part of the Treasurer's budget announcement last night, our government will deliver an additional $1.7 billion to help Australian families with the cost of child care and further encourage workforce participation. This budget will put more money back in families' pockets and lower disincentives for parents to return to work or take on additional hours, particularly for women. Treasury estimates this measure will boost the level of GDP by up to $1.5 billion a year, ensuring Australia remains on track to continue delivering a stronger post-COVID economy in a time where many other countries are struggling to do the same. We are doing this by increasing the subsidy for second and subsequent children aged five and under attending child care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the Morrison government's new measure in place, around three-quarters of subsidies will go to families earning under $150,000 in 2022-23. Labor's bloated, inefficient policy doesn't hold a bar to the targeted and measured support plan the Morrison government has delivered in the past and is committed to delivering throughout the future. When Labor was in government, child care fees went up by 53 per cent, including a one-year spike of 14.5 per cent. During this time, women's workforce participation was still lower than what our government has been able to deliver. The Morrison government understands the needs of families, and we are delivering.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I don't know what Orwellian universe members opposite are living in when coming into this place and somehow wanting to be congratulated with these ridiculous motions coming into this parliament and trying to talk about what is right and what is wrong or what is black and what is white. It is bizarre. Do any of these people ever actually visit early educators and sit down with them? Do they ever actually go to centres and talk to parents, or is it all just made up in their own minds? Let's look at the facts. At the height of the COVID pandemic, child care was—and it remains—essential work. Cheaper child care remains, in my community and across Australia, for many Australians the No. 1 priority. But I want to look at the government's childcare support plan, because it shows they are out of step and out of touch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families, child care and early educators are worse off under the Prime Minister's botched system, and it's not good enough. We know during COVID that we saw families and workers discriminated. It locked people out of child care. This nonsense of 'free child care to everyone with a job' was an absolute con. Families in my electorate were denied places, and, shamefully, healthcare workers on maternity leave who were called back to work through the pandemic missed out. Meanwhile, non-essential workers who were told to keep their kids at home for the health and safety of the community were still charged gap fees by centres. When the minister gave a commitment to grant exemptions on these fees, it was overruled by the Prime Minister's office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families are still being let down right across Australia. We have the most expensive childcare fees in the OECD. I repeat: we have the most expensive childcare fees in the OECD. I'm not having any lectures from the member for Higgins, the member for Chisholm or the member for Lindsay, who are so out of touch with their own communities that they think we've got a good system in place. I suggest to those members: get out of your Canberra bubble and actually talk to your constituents; actually listen to what they've got to say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also failed childcare centres, putting enormous financial pressure on them. I challenge any of them to say that during the pandemic they went to their centres and the centres said: 'This is great. We've never had it so good.' They didn't. They all struggled. All the owners and all the providers were saying, 'This is a botched system.' A third of childcare businesses were barred from accessing JobKeeper, even though they were obligated to stay open and carry out their essential work. And let's not forget that childcare centres were the first that the government targeted to rip away JobKeeper—the very first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers in my electorate lived from pay cheque to pay cheque before the pandemic. I remember, back in 2019, speaking to locals who sent their kids to an early learning centre in the suburb of Bellbird Park, and they were already sounding the alarm. That business was struggling to pay its workers, and they were struggling to make ends me. Fast forward to 2020 and the work of carers was more important than ever. While carers risked their own health to take care of other essential workers' children, the government passed the financial burden on to the sector, which was already struggling. There was no free child care for those people. It is false and misleading for this government to come to this place and say so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night's budget proved that throwing money at the government's childcare plan will not fix it. Labor understands that a broken system needs to be overhauled, not just patched up, especially since families won't receive a dollar of relief from the Morrison government until July 2022, which is—what a coincidence!—after the federal election. I bet the member for Lindsay is not putting that on her glossy brochures. I bet the member for Higgins is not telling everyone, 'Ts and Cs apply.' I bet they're not saying that. I bet they're saying, 'We're reforming the childcare sector—by the way, not till 2022, after we get re-elected.' We know what this government is about. What about the families—the majority of families—that only have one child in child care? What do they get? They get a big fat zero from this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has proven that it has no idea how to stop families, particularly women, from losing money or losing work to childcare fees. An Albanese Labor government will support women by reforming the sector so that the majority of people—97 per cent—will be better off. That is the truth of our policy. The member for Chisholm may call that bloated. I call it a government that's going to be on the side of the people.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  The Morrison government's headline-seeking optimism about Australia's social, economic and budgetary forecast stands in stark contrast to what it feels like on the ground as we recover from the pandemic on the north side of Brisbane. The Morrison government gave itself an awful lot of kudos last night in the budget speech, taking credit for the hard work and sacrifice of the Australian people in getting our country through the pandemic. Australian aged-care workers and childcare workers stood on the front line, risking their own personal safety, and, on extremely low pay, helped us get through this crisis. Australians need structural reform in our economy to repair it post-COVID. They need structural reform to make the economy work better for them. Australians need a government with an actual vision for how we can build back better together.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pandemic isn't over, and the fallout from the pandemic is causing too many northsiders to suffer. These issues were simply not addressed in the budget last night. The Zillmere Community Centre, in my electorate of Lilley, is continuing to see the fallout of the axing of JobKeeper and the cutting of the JobSeeker rate, with more northsiders ringing for emergency housing assistance. They're anticipating many more will follow. Many of the people that the Zillmere Community Centre assists lost their jobs during COVID, and the temporary increase in JobSeeker helped them just to pay the rent to get through those months. Now that the increased JobSeeker rate is gone, northsiders are telling Sharon and the team that they can't afford their rent or their mortgages. They're sleeping in their cars or on the couches of their friends, and their children are going without meals.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Northside Connect, in Nundah, now have at least 60 northsiders a week asking for food, and they've had to open their doors for an extra day per week to hand out fresh fruit and vegies and help northside kids get enough to eat. The economy is not working for these northsiders, who can't afford to take their kids to the dentist. The economy isn't working for the northsiders who rely on these community centres for dinner. The economy is not working for the northsiders who are sleeping on friends' couches while they look for work that isn't there. Last night's budget didn't do anything for these northsiders.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I hosted the Lilley Seniors Forum at the Geebung RSL to find out what seniors felt they needed from the federal budget. The feedback I received was unanimous. Seniors feel ignored and unseen in Morrison's Australia. Their pleas on the deeming rates go ignored. Our aged-care system is fundamentally broken. There aren't enough My Aged Care packages, and too many older Australians are still stuck on that waitlist. The Treasurer last night announced $3.5 billion for aged care, and as a flashy headline it sounds very welcome, but the devil's always in the detail. This funding announcement is just one-third of what the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety found had been cut by this coalition government over the last five years, and it's less than half the funding boost that the royal commission recommended. The government also announced 80,000 new home-care packages, which is good, but there are almost 100,000 senior Australians on the home-care waitlist. So what is happening to the other 20,000 people waiting for those packages? Are they going to continue to be left waiting? It's not good enough. On behalf of the Lilley locals who came to that seniors forum and who asked for our government to do better, and older northsiders' families who are losing sleep at night worrying about what is going to happen to their parents when the time comes, I will keep fighting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian workers can expect to receive a 2.25 per cent real pay cut this financial year and a 0.25 per cent pay cut next financial year because the Morrison government's submission to the Fair Work Commission's annual wage review opposed any significant increase in the minimum wage. This budget was supposed to be the Morrison government's mea culpa. It was supposed to take stock of their failings over the last eight years, beg for forgiveness and actually put in some real change that would make our economy work again. But they're not on the side of low-paid workers; they're not on the side of workers who are trying to plan for their future while trapped in insecure and casual work; they're not on the side of people who are looking for work, many of whom have now been pushed back below the poverty line because of the drop in the JobSeeker rate; and they're not on the side of older Australians who are still waiting for access to aged-care services in their own homes or who are at risk of being neglected in our private aged-care system. We have aged-care workers in the building this morning pleading for real change to try and keep the people who want to be in the system there, and there was nothing on offer for those people last night. This government is not on the side of Australian women, including our frontline workers in the care economy who kept us all alive, safe and functioning during the pandemic. I guess, because they're not in high-vis, they're not on Team Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  We are successfully paving the way to a full economic, health and social recovery for Australia. Last month the unemployment rate dropped again, this time to 5.6 per cent. The Australian economy has recovered 85 per cent of the fall since the start of the pandemic. There were 70,700 new jobs created in April 2021 alone, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Consumer sentiment is the highest it's been in 11 years. Australians are confident in the Morrison government's ability to steer us out of this pandemic, businesses are no longer afraid to invest and other countries on the global map are looking to Australia's handling of this COVID-19 crisis. While the United Kingdom's economy contracted by 9.9 per cent, Italy's by 8.9 per cent, France's by 8.2 per cent, Canada's by five per cent, Japan's by 4.8 per cent and the United States' by 3.3 per cent, Australia, in comparison, was only down by 2.5 per cent.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night the Morrison government revealed the next stage of this government's economic plan in the 2021-22 budget. This budget will secure Australia's economic recovery, create more jobs, ensure that Australians have access to essential services and make sure we come out on the other side of this pandemic stronger and more resilient than ever. Included in this budget are a $1.7 billion Child Care Package to boost workforce participation; a $353.9 million investment to support women's health, including funding for cervical and breast cancer, endometriosis and reproductive health; a $1.2 billion Digital Economy Strategy which will provide the framework for ensuring Australia is a world-leading digital economy and society by 2030; the $1 billion Building Better Regions Fund to deliver infrastructure upgrades to regional airports, sporting precincts and health facilities; and a new National Recovery and Resilience Agency to coordinate and align Australia's national capability to build resilience, better prepare for natural disasters and recover from all hazards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The data speaks for itself. It's written there in black and white. This is not a government that has fallen behind, and it's incorrect to even suggest otherwise. We are leading by example and we are recovering strongly. Yes, there are still some bumps in the road, some creases to iron out and some challenges ahead, and there are sectors and regions out there that are doing it tough, but Australia's economic recovery is strong, broad based, resilient and well underway. This was confirmed by last week's national accounts. We will continue to lend our economic support to all Australians and businesses every step of the way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other figures which should be noted include that the Australian economy grew by 3.1 per cent in the December quarter, following a 3.4 per cent rise in September. This is the first time in recorded history that Australia has seen two consecutive quarters of economic growth of more than three per cent. Growth over the quarter also reflected a renewed pick-up in private investment, supported by government policy incentives such as HomeBuilder and business tax incentives. New private business investment also expanded by 2.6 per cent. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While out and about in my electorate of Longman, the main concerns brought up by my constituents as a result of this pandemic are employment, crime and support for small and medium businesses, which is why it's great to see our labour market has also remained resilient, with the incredible news that there are now more Australians in employment than there were pre-pandemic. I'm proud to say that our information tells us we are the first OECD nation to achieve this. Leading indicators suggest the labour market recovery will continue in the near term, with the National Skills Commission vacancy index up by 11 per cent through the year to January. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a business owner myself, I'm a big advocate for business investment in the electorate of Longman. With consumer and business confidence back to pre-pandemic levels, I'm hoping that more businesses will choose to invest as confidence continues to increase, which will see more businesses open across Longman. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These numbers are a reflection of one thing, and that is business confidence—confidence in the Morrison government's ability to manage the economy in a responsible manner during the most testing time since the Second World War. I look forward to this trend continuing while remaining in government and look forward to being a part of a government that will continue to inspire a private sector led and government supported recovery from the pandemic. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  This was supposed to be the empathy budget. After hours and hours of empathy training, we were going to get a compassionate empathy budget. It was supposed to be the women's budget. After eight long years, this government finally acknowledged that they had not done enough when it comes to women's economic security. But whether it was an empathy budget or a women's budget, it was not a caring budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The back-in-black Treasurer handed out $3.2 billion to aged care with zero accountability. We know this government's approach when it comes to how they handed out JobKeeper to businesses that did not need it while denying JobKeeper to businesses and individuals who did. Last night we saw this $3.2 billion pumped into the aged-care sector with no guarantee that it will go towards food, no guarantee it will go towards higher wages and no guarantee it will go towards more places—just throwing public money around. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I met with members of the United Workers Union and their Aged Care Director, Carolyn Smith, to talk about what they saw in this budget. These are the people on the front line, the people who actually deliver aged-care services across Australia. One worker, Jude, who has worked in the sector for decades and is an incredibly passionate advocate for the sector and the people she cares about, told me it's projected that in the next two years there will be some 15,000 workers in aged care over the age of 60. That age is getting closer to the end of their working lives and closer to needing support themselves. Jude did not see a proper workforce plan in this budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had other aged-care workers from South Australia and Queensland tell us that in the last two years we had 26,000 people die while waiting for a home-care package. If that's not proof that Australia is falling behind, I don't know what is—26,000 people dying while waiting for home-care packages. What we saw last night means we will continue to fall behind, because it doesn't clear the waiting list. I want to bring the words of aged-care workers into this place. They say, 'We get out of bed because we want to care for people.' They say, 'People are being burnt out; they are leaving the sector.' And they point out the absolutely obvious: 'After eight years of this government, you didn't need a royal commission to know that aged care was in crisis.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's just one area. As this motion highlights, there are so many where Australia is falling behind. After eight years of this government, real wages are lower; education outcomes have declined; we have the highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions of any country in the world; and after the glorious reign of former Prime Minister Turnbull and his amendments to the National Broadband Network, Australia is 61st in the world for broadband speeds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the real challenge this government faces when it comes to where we're falling behind is where it hits every working family's hip pocket: wages. Last night the Treasurer talked loudly and proudly about his government's plans for the economy, but there was one topic on which he was very quiet: wage growth. The Treasurer's speech last night was half an hour long—4,000 words. He managed to mention wages just once. It was not a paragraph or a section of his speech but just one word. And we know why that is: because this government has no plan to grow wages. We know that the wage price index is estimated to rise just 1.25 per cent for June and 1.5 per cent for the year after—real wage declines. We've been told that Australia's economic engine is 'roaring back to life'. That was the quote of the Treasurer last night. It's clear that this engine does not roar when it comes to wage growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the report that's been prepared by the member for Bruce, we see that what this government does instead is make people dip into their own savings, dip into the wages they've already earnt rather than give them genuine wage increases. It was this government that forced nearly two million Australians to rip some $35.9 billion from their superannuation just to survive the pandemic. This government, for the last—</span>

                  <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:08</span>):  At the outset I commend Julian Hill, the member for Bruce, for bringing this important motion before the House. This motion that's before the House is grounded in the very careful analysis that the member for Bruce has done, going through the myriad of ways in which the Australian economy and society have slipped backwards under this coalition government. He has documented that real wages in Australia were 0.7 per cent lower in 2019 compared to 2013. And in last night's budget we saw the terrifying news that, at the end of the forward estimates, wages in real terms will be lower than they were at the beginning of the forward estimates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just pause to think about that. The buying power of Australian workers will fall under this government's policies. Next year—just in one financial year—wages for the average Australian, after inflation, will go down $200. Australians, in buying-power terms, will be $200 worse off. This budget has a trillion dollars of debt. The party that once drove a truck around the country with the debt emblazoned on the side—the member for Forde is smiling here. He certainly remembers this truck. Do you remember the number, Member for Forde? It was $315 billion, written on the side. We now have a trillion dollars of debt being delivered by the Treasurer who used to say how much he admired Margaret Thatcher. You can only imagine what Margaret Thatcher would think about a Liberal Treasurer who had 'back in black' mugs printed and then had to have them smashed and who has never delivered a budget surplus and never will deliver a budget surplus. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As this important motion highlights, Australia's government debt has blown out under the coalition. The Liberals had doubled the debt before the pandemic hit and now they're on track to double it again; yet there's no lasting reform to show for that. There's no legacy as a result of what's been done. Contrast this with past governments that have invested in the future. If you look at the legacy of the Chifley and Curtin governments at the end of World War II, they didn't simply say, 'Let's go back to the economy as it was in 1939.' No. Instead, they said, 'Let's aspire to full employment; let's aspire to increasing homeownership.' They delivered on those outcomes. By contrast, under the coalition we've had rising underemployment. One of the reasons the Reserve Bank now says that we ought to be aiming for a full employment rate that is not five per cent but four point something is that the level of underemployment has gone up. The benchmark of unemployment needs to be lower to deliver the same outcomes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work that the member for Bruce has done highlights the problems of Australian homeownership. Australia is now the third most unaffordable housing market within the OECD. It highlights Australia's household debt as a share of GDP, sitting at 119 per cent, the second-highest rate out of 41 countries assessed. That high level of household debt is directly tied to the problem of housing affordability in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On literacy and numeracy, every time the OECD's PISA testers come to Australia to test our year 9s in science, mathematics and reading they find that Australian teenagers are performing worse than they did on the previous test. We're going backwards not just in relative terms but in absolute terms. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bruce's motion highlights our climate policy, the fact that greenhouse gas emissions per capita have been the highest in the world, that Australia ranks second-worst globally for government climate policy and that Australia has the second-highest level of biodiversity deterioration in the world. On climate, we saw very little from last night's budget. There was no Biden-like investment in a clean energy transition and the jobs that flow from that; instead, there was just more rhetoric and a failure to deliver on tackling dangerous climate change.</span>

What I find fascinating is that in the member for Fenner's contribution he articulated exactly what this government is doing. He referenced governments post World War II and their actions to produce full employment and to increase housing affordability. That's exactly what this budget delivered last night and that's exactly what this government has been delivering for the past 12 months, through a whole range of measures, whether it's JobKeeper or the HomeBuilder package. I know, in my electorate of Forde, with over 13½ thousand people employed in construction and manufacturing, that HomeBuilder has delivered tremendous support to our local tradespeople. We're doing some stuff around the home at the moment, and to get a tradesperson to come and even just quote on a job is nigh on impossible. This is a direct result of the policies of this government by ensuring that we have the supports in the economy to assist the economy through this coronavirus pandemic.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was recently at Stoddard Group at Ormeau, and they also have a depot at Loganholme. They make steel frames for homes. As a result of the increased workflow and increased building activity flowing out of HomeBuilder, they have employed 40 new staff in their business. The job sites they supply have increased from some 30,000 to some 36,000. To meet this extra demand, they have invested some $1.5 million in six new metal roll forming machines. This investment was made much easier by government's extended instant asset write-off program.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, the member for Fenner raised in his contribution investing for the future. I'm very pleased to tell this House, and to let the people of Forde know, that we as a government are investing for the future. Over $1 billion has been invested and is being invested in the years to come in upgrades to the M1 between the Gateway Motorway and the Logan Motorway to finish that last section of upgrades that has been overlooked for so long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have spent multimillion dollars on safety upgrades to Beaudesert Beenleigh Road, to Beenleigh Redland Bay Road and to Tamborine Oxenford Road. We're spending over a hundred million dollars on upgrades to exits 41, 45 and 49 at Yatala South, Ormeau and Pimpama. We're investing $65 million for the relocation of the Loganlea Train Station and also additional commuter car parking. In addition to that, in the budget, we announced another $178 million investment in the upgrade of the rail line between Kuraby and Beenleigh to ensure that, in time, we can have faster train services between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. That is a key section on that line where there are a number of tight curves that make it difficult or not safe to run a high-speed rail. There will be a $37.5 million investment in the next upgrade project on the Mount Lindesay Highway in the west of my electorate from Stoney Camp Road and Chambers Flat Road. Work on that is now well underway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, we've had significant direct investments to our local councils through the COVID support packages for upgrades to community facilities, roads and other infrastructure. I know that people, particularly the people in Bethania, will be delighted by the nearly $1 million investment in the intersection of Logan Street and Albert Street, which is a very dangerous intersection. It will become signalised as a result of the investment by the federal government in assisting Logan City Council. In addition to that, there is support for trainees and apprentices. Some 705 apprentices have benefited from our Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements. We are investing in the future. I am proud of what this government is doing. It is securing the future of our economy and it is delivering for the electorate of Forde.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  Last night the government delivered a budget—a budget that does not address systemic economic and social failures in this country. We know this because, after eight years of inaction from this Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, we have the data to prove it. How is Australia performing compared with other countries? How are Australians going in their eighth year of this government? The answer is detailed but also very simple. The member for Bruce has drawn on the most reputable sources of information in the world, and I thank him for this motion. The answer is clear: Australia is underperforming. We are all in a weaker position because of the Liberal government. Australia is less productive, more unequal, more corrupt, less happy, more indebted, less affluent and less trusting of public institutions than when this Liberal government was elected in 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pre-COVID, Australia sat third last in the OECD, out of 35 countries, for wages growth. Last night the government published their plan to keep wages down, particularly the wages of women. Over the eight years of the current government, Australia's productivity rate has been steadily declining, from 2013, when Australia was ranked 10th among 34 OECD nations, to 2018, when Australia was ranked fifth last. This government delivers marketing solutions to real-world problems, and the result is a poorer, weaker, underperforming and uncertain Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night this government set out to take a victory lap on the back of the economic and personal sacrifices made by the Australian people and their state governments. The problem for the federal government is that Victorians remember what happened. They remember that the Andrews government called on Victorians to come together to do what was needed to keep us all safe—and Victorians did. They remember the sacrifice they made to keep their families, their communities and their country safe. They remember that it was hard; it was very hard. But they know it was the right thing to do, because every state and territory has followed Victoria's leadership and because the places that didn't lock down are disproportionately suffering now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also remember the Treasurer coming into parliament and shrieking about lockdowns. They remember the Prime Minister playing political games with his cabinet about COVID restrictions in the Labor-led but not coalition-led states. Victorians know that the Treasurer can and should take about as much credit for this economic forecast as he can for the weather forecast, because Victorians know that any improved economic outlook belongs to their sacrifice. They know that this forecast belongs to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everything the federal government touched through COVID got botched. They shirked their constitutional responsibility for quarantine and the vaccine rollout. Consequently, we've lost months and months of valuable time in which to deliver a timely and effective rollout. And they put all their eggs in one basket with the AstraZeneca vaccine—not a wise decision. But we should not be surprised, because botched ideology and mismanaged media strategies are what this government has presided over for eight long years. The growth forecast is improved, but the debt has more than doubled and wages have not increased. The government have hung a 'mission accomplished' banner out, without doing enough to fix the system and protect the vulnerable in the aged-care sector. And the economy will still suffer, because the government cannot get it into their head that child care is an investment. Last night we saw the kinds of political fixes that give birth to the long-term problems raised by this courageous motion by the good member for Bruce—eight long, hard years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have different priorities, and our leader will tomorrow night outline these priorities to fix the broken system under the coalition government. Our priorities are secure, well-paid jobs alongside cleaner and cheaper energy and robust emissions reduction targets. Our priorities are getting the settings right so that this country rewards effort, not inheritance. Our priorities are about working towards an Australia that can again take pride in what we make here, how we treat each other, how we treat women and how we provide opportunities for all. This is the Australia that the people of my electorate are striving for and one that I will fight for every day. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  There is one line in this motion by the member for Bruce that sums up the absolute desperation of the motion's contents, and that is the line that says that the Australian government has racked up over one trillion dollars worth of debt 'with nothing to show for it'—intellectual dishonesty throughout this motion. What an insult to the people of Australia. What an insult to the hardworking men and women, those frontline workers who went to work every single day and put themselves in the face of danger. We have 'nothing to show for it', according to Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at the state of our nation's health. You only need to look across to the United States, India and Great Britain to see what they are facing. It is through the hard work of this government, the early intervention by this government, that we do not have tens of thousands of deaths, just like those countries across the ocean. What an insult to those men, women and children who locked themselves away for weeks and months at a time to say that we have 'nothing to show' for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the economic recovery. What an insult from the member for Bruce to those men and women who continued to work from home or continued to go to work, where they could, and keep our economy going; who were resilient; who changed their business habits to keep employing, through the government's JobKeeper scheme, those employees who had been with them for years, if not decades. What an insult to the men and women who kept going, despite not knowing where this pandemic was taking us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the way that Labor wants you to think. Labor need to think about who they want to be as a party and as people. Are you going to be the person who says to your grandchild in 30 years time, 'I worked with the federal government to ensure that our country got through this pandemic,' or are you going to be that person who says, 'I kicked the country and the people while they were down, and I moved motions to say the government have done nothing over the past 12 months'? The member for Bruce should be not only embarrassed by but ashamed of this motion. He should be apologising to the people of Australia for not recognising the work that they have done over the past 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to look at the real facts, unemployment is almost down to where it was prior to the pandemic. There are over 100,000 more jobs available than pre the pandemic—and yet the member for Bruce says we've done nothing and have nothing to show for it. Consumer confidence is at a 12-year high and job vacancies at a two-decade high. The intellectual dishonesty oozes through this motion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hang your head in shame, Member for Bruce, because Australians are better than that. They're not stupid. They can see what this government is doing and what this government has done, and last night is a perfect example of that. We are providing hope. That's what politicians do. We provide hope for our nation and we provide direction, and that is what we will continue to do for all our people. Whether you vote Labor, whether you vote Independent or whether you vote coalition, we will be here for you, providing those supports, just as we have done over the past 12 months. Once again I say to the member for Bruce: hang your head in shame and apologise to the people of Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:28</span>):  I welcome the contribution from my colleague the member for Cowper and I share his disappointment that this motion is grossly inaccurate. I will actually mention that I have seen the member for Bruce contribute very positively in this place. He is passionate about helping others, including those in nations around the world who find themselves in trouble. However, I do have to point out some inaccuracies and I feel also compelled to passionately defend the record of this Australian federal government during the response to the pandemic and indeed now, during this recovery phase. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is the envy of the world right now, and this is absolutely no accident. It's through the careful and practical approach that has been displayed by our Prime Minister, our Treasurer, our health minister and indeed our whole team. The Treasurer put it very accurately last night when he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are better placed than nearly any other country … to meet the economic challenges that lie ahead. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, our economy has recovered strongly and is set to return to pre-pandemic levels nine months earlier than expected, and our unemployment rate is set to recover five times as fast as after the 1990s recession. Australia, on both the health front and the economic front, has outperformed all other advanced economies in 2020. Consumer sentiment is at its highest in 11 years, and more Australians are now in work than ever before. We're delivering personal income tax cuts, business tax incentives, new apprenticeships, more jobs, more infrastructure, and record funding for schools, health care, aged care and the NDIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was elected to represent the people of Stirling, so let's have a look for a moment at what that means for my constituents in Stirling. As to the Morrison government's JobKeeper program, I still have people coming up to me and saying, 'Vince, I want to just pass on that JobKeeper helped save my job,' or, 'It helped keep me able to employ others and move through that initial response and into this recovery phase.' In Stirling, there were 5,800 businesses who benefited from JobKeeper. That's translated to 23,800 employees whose jobs were saved. Those businesses are now back to high levels of vibrancy and profitability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 62,100 taxpayers in Stirling will benefit from tax relief this year. There are 1,750 apprentices right now in Stirling, and this is set to take off, with more investment in apprenticeships and trainee places. Twenty-one thousand six hundred businesses in Stirling will be able to write off the full value of any eligible assets, and $1.6 billion is being committed in Western Australia for projects that will ease congestion, connect communities and improve road safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">HomeBuilder is another resounding success in the way it has been adopted and in the aims it has sought and achieved. In Western Australia, there have been 17,752 applications, and these continue to support jobs in the construction sector and assist owner-occupiers as they build a new home or substantially renovate an existing home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I'll move to the part in this motion which specifically refers to the Morrison government's environmental record, and I am very pleased to provide some important corrections in this regard as well. We have strong targets, an enviable track record and a clear plan for the future. Our approach—technology, not taxes—is already delivering results. Indeed, we beat our 2020 target by 459 million tonnes, and we're on track to meet and beat our 2030 Paris target. Last year was a record for new renewable energy capacity being installed in Australia, with seven gigawatts of new renewable capacity. That is more renewables in one year under the Morrison government than under the whole of the previous Labor government. Unlike Labor, we're not going to try and reduce emissions by shutting down whole industries or taxing and regulating industries off the planet. We have a clear target, we have a proven ability to get there and we will continue on this pathway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just government but also businesses and key agencies who play an important role. My former employer Woodside support the Paris agreement and have set their own clear targets to reduce emissions. And, of course, there are agencies who are championing LNG as a marine fuel. I congratulate Tony Brooks and BE&amp;R Consulting for partnership with the Society for Gas as a Marine Fuel.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a long and proud record of energy efficiency in this country. We have stood by and done our part in what is a global problem: to reduce carbon emissions so that the most catastrophic impacts of climate change are avoided in this century. When you look at the results that Australia has been able to produce compared to other nations around the world that are constantly held up to us as nations that we should be following, it is a stark contrast. Australia has reduced its carbon emissions by 19 per cent since the year 2000. Compare that to Canada, which has only reduced its emissions by one per cent. Compare that to New Zealand, which has only just managed to reduce its emissions by two per cent. Compare our programs around the world and, time and time again, with the exception of the United Kingdom, Australia's results are incredibly favourable and demonstrate that we are committed to what is a global problem and are playing our part to resolve this global issue. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians—and this is a little-known fact, because those members of the media who are more concerned about spreading fear than they are about informing their readers and viewers will not allow this fact to be told—are the highest investors and the highest deployers of renewable energy per capita that in the world. And not just by a little bit, but by a factor of 100 per cent. The next nearest country to us invests exactly half as much as we do per capita in renewable energy. We do not have a nuclear power sector in Australia as they do in France, as they do in the United States and as they do in the United Kingdom, yet we have been able to reduce emissions from the energy sector year on year on year. None of this is ever given any airtime by those members of the media and by those people, that caste of Australians, who hate their fellow Australians and hate the country they live in, because all they're interested in doing is pulling their fellow Australians down. </span>

We are not allowed to stand on the world stage and say, while we are humble, that we are proud of those things that we have been able to achieve and, in a true testament to what is a great nation, that we are willing to share the lessons of that achievement. We can't do that, because we are subject to abuse and misinformation and our fellow Australians are dragged down at every possible opportunity. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are achievements that we should be proud of. Instead, we are told that we have achieved nothing compared to nations like Canada and New Zealand, who trail us, year after year, on this most important issue. I say to those who denigrate my nation—our nation—and our fellow Australians: it is time for you to stop, not only for the sake of us but for the sake of those people who live on this planet and for the sake of those who want to see a resolution to global climate change. Because it is only when we can be proud and talk about those things that we have managed to achieve, in a humble fashion, that we will be able to share the great gifts that we can with the world and move this debate forward. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have incredibly strong targets. We have an enviable track record in this space and we have something that so many other people around the world want. It is easy to stand on a stage with cheering people and tell them that we will produce net carbon emissions by 2050, and leave the plan to later. But we take the responsible decision, our countrymen take the responsible decision, our nation takes the responsible decision to not make commitments without a plan in hand to achieve those things—because that is dishonest, because that leads to disillusionment, because that is the road to fear. That is the road to disenchantment among so many young people, who believe that their very existence on this planet is at risk because we cannot tell the truth. But we have told the truth. This government, this nation, will not make commitments to net zero without a plan. </span>

I invite those who make fun of this nation and who criticise my fellow Australians to compare our results to that of virtually every other nation in the world and then they, too, can see what we have achieved. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  I thank the member for Mackellar for this motion. This is a good follow-on from me, because when I'm reminded that Australians have the highest uptake of household solar power in the world, I am very proud of this country. This proves the appetite of Australians to do their bit on renewables. But the government must also do its bit, and I'm not alone in feeling like it let down its side of the bargain in the budget last night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, this budget was a missed opportunity for the government when it came to renewable energy, with an exception. As a supporter of green hydrogen, I'm thrilled that Wodonga was chosen by ARENA as one of the three sites for Australia in the construction of a green-hydrogen plant. This is a great step forward for weaning approximately 40,000 connections in Albury-Wodonga off fossil fuels. Some government statements were made about the project that are not entirely accurate, though. It's not, for example, the equal largest electrolyser in the world. At 10 megawatts, it will be half the size of the hydrogen electrolysers with 20- to 25-megawatt capacities in France, Germany and Japan. But I put this down to excitement over the project, which is, indeed, a very exciting project, and I'm thrilled about it. This hydrogen project is a fantastic start, but we also need to do much more for renewables in regional Australia that don't include the risks inherent in projects like this, such as the potential for offshoring profits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Mackellar has claimed in his motion that Australia is a renewable energy powerhouse, but who and what part of Australia is he talking about? We represent very different places and very different people. Whenever I step into this place, I am thinking, talking and advocating for the residents of rural and regional areas—people like the people of Indi. Without more visionary intervention, the opportunities and benefits of renewable energy will be spread unevenly. More likely than not, regional Australia will miss out. But there is another way, and that's my plan for a renewables driven economic boom so that regional Australians are the big winners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share an example of regional people seeing real benefits from renewable energy. Last Thursday I was in Benalla to cut the ribbon on Munro Avenue Kindergarten's new solar installation. This is the first action under Renewable Energy Benalla's Community Energy Project, and this project will fund energy savings on community facilities which will be paid forward onto the next project. Standing alongside me were members of the community; members of the council; the community group itself; representatives from FRV Winton Solar Farm, who are producing the solar energy; solar panel installers Solargain; and, of course, those gorgeous little kindergarten children. This project demonstrates how small-scale renewables can help regional people save money so our kindergartens can get on with the job of taking care of our kids and spending less on power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My bill, the Australian Local Power Agency Bill 2021, would deliver $310 million worth of grants to similar projects right across regional Australia and real investment into regional communities to lower our electricity bills with cheap local power. If my agency were established, community ownership would become a feature of every new wind and solar project built in Australia. Project developers would need to offer local residents the opportunity to take up to a 20 per cent ownership stake in the project. The agency would also underwrite new midscale community owned renewable energy projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are government members of both Liberal and National Party persuasions who like what they see in my Australian Local Power Agency. Like me, they see billions of energy dollars draining out of their regions offshore or to the cities. They understand what a difference it would make if the money stayed local—to our regional prosperity and to economic and energy security. It's not ideological; it's really just common sense. It's actually regional development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My fellow MPs want to see regional Australia at the front of the renewable energy boom. The tragedy is that they can only express this sentiment behind closed doors, or at least that's how they feel. What I'm saying to them and to the government is that this is your moment. Get on board or get left behind, and you'll leave the supporters in the regions behind too if you do that. I've taken my plan to the Prime Minister, every single parliamentarian has received a copy of the plan, and my Australian Local Power Agency Bill is going before a parliamentary committee later this year. This is your opportunity. It doesn't matter if it's badged blue, red, orange or gold; I don't care. This is good policy, and it will make a difference. I urge the government to adopt it and truly make Australia the renewables powerhouse it should be.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  I rise to support the member for Mackellar's motion that acknowledges Australia's position as a renewable energy powerhouse in 2020 and the Morrison government's continued commitment to lowering emissions as a world leader in renewable energy technologies and investment. In our efforts to tackle the changing climate, achieving net zero emissions will be a great challenge. However, there is no doubt that the Morrison government does not shy away when confronted with such challenges. Around the world we are seeing those countries that pivot to a lower emissions future relying on innovative and renewable technologies to achieve their goals. Under the leadership of the Morrison government, our plan for Australia's clean energy future is no different. In harnessing the power of science, innovation and technology, we have a plan to create a sustainable and clean energy sector that protects our planet for future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to our plan of a net zero emissions future for Australia. 2020 was a record year for renewable energy uptake in Australia, with the Clean Energy Regulator reporting the installation of seven gigawatts of renewable technologies to the grid. This supersedes the 2019 record of 6.3 gigawatts, signifying an 11 per cent rise in renewables uptake. Our history of supporting renewable technologies is set to continue in 2021, with the Clean Energy Regulator estimating a further six gigawatts of energy to be installed. Our commitment to a clean energy future is already seeing Australia ahead of other countries like the United States, France, Japan, Germany and Canada in investment of renewable technologies on a per capita basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think we were doing nothing, given the way that the media talk about this issue, but there is absolutely no doubt that Australians are putting solar panels on their roofs at record rates, and that is making a real difference. But of course we need to make sure that our energy grid is secure. We need to transition carefully and we need to make sure that this transition brings the whole of Australia with it. This means ensuring that we invest in new technologies as we speak, and I really back in the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction on the five stretch targets in the Low Emissions Technology Statement. That is because it will take new technologies to fill the energy void. We can't get there overnight; we need to transition there. There is no silver bullet for the energy issues facing the globe at this point in time. That means we need to work on all fronts with regard to ensuring that a diversified renewable energies portfolio is what gets us there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, the budget committed a further $539.2 million for a new renewable technologies approach across Australia. Of note, this includes $275 million for the further development of four additional clean hydrogen hubs in regional Australia and the implementation of a clean hydrogen scheme. This is essential not only as we develop hydrogen as a firming technology for clean and dispatchable energy that ensures future reliability and affordability but also as we establish hydrogen as our export commodity for our resources industry. This will create Aussie jobs and support our manufacturing sector in our postpandemic recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that one of the sites for a green hydrogen plant is in Wodonga. As someone who grew up in Albury, just across the river, I know this will help with local jobs incredibly. It's this form of practical approach that will see Australia lead the way with transitioning to a cleaner, greener future. It's pragmatic, it creates jobs and it's something the world needs. And we know this because we know places like Japan and even Germany are looking to a hydrogen-led future and they're looking to invest in Australia to make sure that we can provide hydrogen as a resource for the future. It's about bottling our sunshine and developing it for export overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, our plan is already delivering results. In 2020 we met and beat our Kyoto targets by 459 million tonnes, with recent assessment forecasts that Australia will exceed its 2030 Paris target in tackling climate change. As a result of the Morrison government's commitment to renewable technologies, we're delivering a future that protects our planet and will underpin our economic prosperity for decades to come.</span>

The member for Mackellar is seeking that this House acknowledge Australia as a world leader in renewable energy, when less than a week ago the minister for resources and Northern Australia vetoed support for a significant job-creating renewable energy project. That's right, in this Morrison government's pitch to be a renewable energy powerhouse, they've actively overturned the decision of the board of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility by vetoing support for a wind farm in Far North Queensland. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This renewable energy project was set to create 250 jobs just south of Cairns, an area hit really hard by COVID restrictions and with a lack of an international tourism industry. What's worse, the minister and member for Hinkler is himself a Queenslander. Here he is, along with his whole Liberal-National government, rubbishing and vetoing renewable energy projects and destroying new job-creating projects in Queensland. Yet they have the gall to come in here with this private member's motion to try and promote their renewable energy legacy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There isn't a legacy. In fact, this is the first time a ministerial veto has been used under the NAIF, and this minister chose to veto a wind farm. Minister Pitt said that as renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are mature technologies—the last time I looked, gas pipelines and gas-fired power stations were also mature technologies—the private sector will drive that development. That was the basis for rejecting this wind farm. Gas pipelines and gas-fired power stations are mature technologies. This government will throw hundreds of millions of dollars into gas related projects—that the private sector can't or won't fund because there is a likelihood they'll be stranded assets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a supporter of the gas industry. I've said that openly. It is a transition fuel. It will be for many years to come. Yet this government ditches its support for any renewable energy projects and throws money elsewhere. This is not the Liberal government of old. These are not the liberal economists we expect to see in this building. They throw money around like it's theirs. They think taxpayers' money is theirs, and they don't support the job-creating projects people want. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Mackellar is trying to say one thing in his electorate—and the member for Higgins, and every other Liberal and National member speaking want to say the same thing in their electorates—about how supportive the Liberals and Nationals are of renewable energy, while their minister vetoes support for a job-creating renewable energy project. As the Clean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton observed:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… investors … are increasingly frustrated by the politicisation of a sector that is at the forefront of job creation and economic revitalisation of regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What an excellent point. This government is cutting funding to renewable energy projects that create jobs in regional Australia. Let that go on the record. Let's not forget what they are doing to regional Australia: sucking funding out and sucking jobs out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday we saw an absolute train wreck of an interview, where the minister for resources treated battery technology like it was the Lord Voldemort of modern Australia—the storage capacity-enabling renewable energy projects that shall not be named! This is the minister for resources of Australia. He wants the Australian people to believe that his critical mineral strategy is an essential component for—guess what?—batteries, yet he won't support battery technology, just as this government won't support the wind farm in Queensland. I guess we should expect nothing less of Minister Pitt. After all, it was he who said that solar panels and lithium batteries could turn out to be this generation's asbestos. Good job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this government is isolated on the world stage when it comes to real action on climate change. One hundred and twenty countries, 70 per cent of our trading partners, and every state and territory in the country have committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, but not this bunch of Luddites. The Business Council of Australia, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Industry Group, big resource companies—BHP, Woodside Energy, Rio Tinto, Santos—our biggest airline, our biggest banks, and countless experts and scientists have all committed to the target of net zero emissions by 2050. But not this government. No, they will drag Australia down and prevent us from being a renewable powerhouse, and shame on them. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LIU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  When I first came to Australia many years ago as a student I was astounded by the diversity of natural landscapes. The four corners of Australia may as well be different worlds. This diversity of landscapes and climates means Australia has always been in a pole position to capitalise on our renewable resources, and I can say with certainty that we have taken advantage of all that Australia has to offer. Did you know that one in four Australians turn Australia's baking sun into electricity? Indeed, we have the highest uptake of household solar in the world. Well, Australians have always been great at turning lemons into lemonade, so it makes sense that we are just as great at turning the sun into solar power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member of the Morrison government, I'm proud to say that we are taking real and practical action, and as a result we are delivering lower emissions whilst protecting our economy and the jobs and futures of all Australians. Our government has strong targets, an enviable track record and a clear plan. Unlike the plans that Labor has implemented before, which involved thrusting higher taxes on the shoulders of hardworking Australians, the Morrison government is delivering a plan that is driven by technology, not taxes. We are building ourselves out as a world leader in renewable resource technology. We are propelling innovation forward, driving jobs creation and lowering our emission output whilst delivering reliable, affordable energy for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Investment into renewables has being a priority for Australia. Since 2017, Australia has invested over $35 billion in renewable energy. On a per capita basis, Australia is ahead of countries like the United States, France and Japan, and has more than double the per capita investment of countries like China, Germany and Canada. These are achievements Australians can be proud of. Our investment in renewables doesn't end there. The Morrison government's 2021-22 budget will invest a further $539 million into new clean hydrogen and carbon capture, use and storage projects that will also support Australian industry, creating jobs and lowering emissions. Our new investment into clean hydrogen and carbon capture technologies will create around 2½ thousand jobs in Australia for Australians. It will support Australian industry and manufacturing into the future. And, to top it all off, it will further reduce Australia's emissions output. It's a win-win.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year was a record year for renewable energy capacity installed in Australia. The Clean Energy Regulator reports that seven gigawatts of new renewable capacity was installed in 2020, which is 11 per cent above the previous record in 2019. That's more renewable energy output in one year under a Morrison government than under the whole Labor government when they last held power. I want to be very clear: unlike Labor, our government won't try to reduce emissions by compromising our export industries and the hardworking Australian families that depend on those industries. We have and will continue to lower emissions while ensuring that those who work in export industries can still provide for their families. Our promise to Australians is that we won't raise taxes to get the job done, and we will still do it better than what any Labor government could hope to do.</span>

Leif believed we each have the power to change the world for the better. He created the Instagram handle @changeyoursuper to ask people to think about their super fund and whether it invests in fossil fuels and, if it does, to consider changing to a super fund that doesn't invest in fossil fuels or polluting projects. With approximately $3 trillion invested in Australian super funds, Leif believed everybody could use the power of their money to make a difference. Leif was driven by his convictions and his love of our earth. He cared deeply about climate change and habitat degradation, and he was an active volunteer in planting trees and restoring habitat.</span>

This courageous young man did so much to change the world for the better in just a few short years of adulthood, and Leif's family want to honour his life by continuing his campaign. You can find his campaign at www.leifjustham.com. A tragic loss to the world, Leif will be deeply missed. Thank you.</span>

In 2017, when Tropical Cyclone Debbie hit Queensland, the distillery was once again flooded, but, once it was operational again, the experienced distillers ran the ferment through their stills and the unique rum was released and bottled by hand. Head distiller Wayne Stewart said:</span>

Food home delivery services were booming but ice-cream, especially in Queensland's heat, doesn't easily lend itself to Uber Eats. So the scientists at Frosty Boy decided to create a delicious slow-melt ice-cream—as their famous slogan goes, 'often licked but never beaten'. It is just as good. I can speak firsthand of its great quality.</span>

We saw all last week the headlines about the $320 million in extra infrastructure, but of course the truth is that there is just $4 million next financial year coming from the government for Tasmania. Indeed, over the forward estimates, only a quarter of that money will actually be delivered. Tasmanians know that this government cannot be trusted to deliver infrastructure in my home state.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">An example of this is the Hobart City Deal. In question time today, we had the Deputy Prime Minister talk about Macquarie Point. Macquarie Point has been vacant for eight years, the entire time they have been in government, with nothing happening—nothing. For the Bridgewater Bridge, for five years we've been waiting for the detailed design from this government. Construction still hasn't started on the Bridgewater Bridge. Of course, there's the Hobart Airport roundabout in my electorate. That was announced five years ago and is still under construction.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seriously, how can any Tasmanian take this government and its promises seriously? We know that it's all about announcement and never about delivery when it comes to infrastructure in my home state. The four-lane Midland Highway was promised by Will Hodgman and Tony Abbott back in 2014 to be four lanes all the way. Of course, we still have yet more money in this budget for the Midland Highway, because it still hasn't been delivered, and it never will be.</span>

In proud news for Goldstein, the Fairbairn Cup has returned to the community after Brighton Grammar won the 153rd APS Head of the River Regatta in March. The Head of the River is the most prestigious rowing event on the calendar, and to win the event is an extraordinary achievement. It is 38 years since Brighton's last victory. Captain of boats and stroke of the first VIII Sam Wyss, his crew Hamish Roberts, James Capp, Ethan Calcatjicos, Dougal Bland, Jack Puise, Zach Bowen and Lucas Connell, and coxswain Malachai Bakker rowed their way into first place, edging out St Kevin's and Scotch College. The great victory would not have been possible without a strong network of support—including first VIII coach Oliver Dutton, director of rowing Dick Bartlett and the great Ross Featherston, the headmaster, who I saw on the weekend at the Melbourne versus Brighton game—as well as their parents friends and classmates, who were all participants and cheered them on. Congratulations to the crew and to the whole Brighton Grammar School community. Sport is something that should bring us together. It doesn't matter what achievement you secure, you make us proud, particularly when you compete and succeed in an incredible sporting competition. I congratulate everyone involved.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  After watching the Treasurer deliver the budget last night, I cannot help but think this government has perfected the art of announcements—announcing policies and infrastructure projects but announcing very little on delivery. Last night we heard once again that the North-South Corridor infrastructure project in Adelaide was going to be funded and completed. We have heard this over and over again. This was a promise from Tony Abbott in the lead-up to the 2013 election. It was announced by Joe Hockey in the 2014 budget. It was announced in the 2015 budget, the 2016 budget, the 2017 budget, the 2018 budget, the 2019 budget, the 2020 budget and now in the 2021 budget. We've had the same announcement eight times, yet the Torrens to Anzac Highway section of the project, which is in the electorate of Adelaide, is yet to start. This is a project that this government has announced over and over again. In fact on radio this morning the Liberal Treasurer of South Australia, Rob Lucas—I was on air with him—said there is nothing new in this; this has been announced over and over and it is only $1 billion per year for all infrastructure projects in South Australia. This project's cost is $8.9 billion. This is pie in the sky, a furphy, another reannouncement. The government has perfected the art of announcements, the art of marketing and the art of sales.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  This week's federal budget is another major boost for Sunshine Coast infrastructure, with $172 million worth of new projects funded by the Morrison government, which will help secure our region's recovery. The Morrison government is investing $160 million to transform the Mooloolah River interchange. The Queensland Labor government can't do it on their own because they are absolutely hopeless. Anyone who travels to or from Mooloolaba on Nicklin Way or Sunshine Motorway would know that this section of road is an absolute deathtrap. This funding is going to get locals home sooner and safer, and boost the local economy with construction jobs now as well as provide a more attractive experience for tourists into the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget includes $7 million to extend Caloundra's Third Avenue to Nicklin Way, forming a real solution to the gridlock around the Nicklin Way-Caloundra Road roundabout. I listened carefully to the community's concerns about this project. However, I am now satisfied that, with this funding, we will preserve the character of the region while delivering a massive and long-awaited benefit for all Caloundra residents. This is another project that the Queensland Labor government couldn't or wouldn't fund without the federal government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  The Morrison government are running an unacceptable scare campaign designed to allow them to rip apart the NDIS. It's disgraceful behaviour, targeting people with a disability and their families and carers, and I am determined to call them out for it. In the lead-up to this year's budget, the government got caught out faking a cost blowout in the NDIS. The government dropped stories they'd designed to suggest that NDIS costs were unsustainable and on the trajectory of being more expensive than Medicare costs. Yet all it took was a quick check of projections to expose that these claims were a fake, a scare campaign.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there are a number of areas of the NDIS where the government is trying to scare people with disability and their families and carers, such as independent assessments. I have had call after call from people with disabilities and their families in my community who are scared, who are worried about the proposal for independent assessments, because they know that this is code for this government wanting to cut the support they get. They know this means they're going to have to do what they were told they wouldn't have to do: tell their story over and over again, prove their disability. Well, this government is making them do that. That's the proposal. That's what is on the table with these independent assessments. It is a scare campaign. It is the government undermining the NDIS. Labor backs the NDIS. Labor built the NDIS. We will always support it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  Good solutions in a time of crisis start with leadership—leadership that listens to stakeholders, crafts efficient and effective policies and then executes well. The minister for tourism has done exactly that for the Gold Coast, listening to Gold Coast tourism stakeholders, who've said that what they need most is tourists through their doors. What was the response from the Morrison government and the minister? It was $1.2 billion in a tourism support package. The half-price airfares that were sold as part of that package are helping a record number of Australians to enjoy a holiday at home this year. This has been a fantastic initiative for the Gold Coast. The Gold Coast has been the No. 1 destination of choice for Australians, with close to 200,000 flights sold to deliver tourists to spend at local businesses and cafes. It's important to note that for every dollar spent on airfares 10 more dollars will be spent on the ground.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge the leadership of Destination Gold Coast CEO Patricia O'Callaghan and the chairman of Destination Gold Coast, Paul Donovan, for their constructive advocacy, influencing solutions for the tourism industry. And I will continue to listen to them. The 2021 budget is very, very good for Moncrieff. The tourism industry is welcoming the various pro-business messages, extension of the SME loan guarantee scheme and the extended and expanded JobTrainer fund that will add to the current 290 apprentices in Moncrieff. The Morrison government is securing Australia's economy.</span>

These are important events in the community, and I know how much people have missed them with the COVID-19 restrictions. I started by attending the Altona RSL's regular commemoration and march through Altona the weekend before Anzac Day. On Anzac Day the dawn service in Williamstown, a much-loved event, saw the involvement of many local community groups and military branches. This was followed by a lively community focused commemorative service in Newport, which drew a very large turnout. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While it's great to again be able to go in person to events like this, organising them in a COVID-safe way takes a lot more work than usual. So I want to thank everyone for the work that made that happen. As usual, it's thanks to a small handful of volunteers giving up their time. Newport Sub-Branch nominee Mary Nicholls and president Bob Gladysz gave upwards of 100 hours each in the last week of the Anzac Day appeal. I also want to take this opportunity to thank everyone at the Newport RSL Sub-Branch who went the extra mile to make these important Anzac Day commemorations a reality and raise a record amount for the Anzac Day appeal. So, thank you to Bob Gladysz, the president; Ian Nicholls; Lieutenant Colonel Brendan Dowling; Captain Phil Barber; Major Mark Bainbridge; Peter O'Brien; William Malcolmson; Retired Major Gabrielle Prideaux; Scott Petrie; Mary Nicholls; the Newport RSL Sub-Branch members; the service men and women who volunteered their time for the Anzac Day appeal; and the local businesses and schools who contributed to it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  Two years ago, in April 2019, the Morrison government made an $18 million commitment towards a multicampus university in the heart of the Gosford CBD. This investment represented the start of stage 2 of our partnership with the University of Newcastle to deliver a university in Gosford, with the funds going towards infrastructure, including the design, development, construction and fit-out of a university campus extension. This commitment built on the jointly funded $85 million Central Coast Clinical School and Research Institute, which will open its doors to students, clinicians and researchers in July this year. I'm so pleased to be able to update the House that, after advocating for over two years for a location for a multi-campus university, the New South Wales government announced on Monday that the site of the former Mitre 10 on Mann Street in Gosford is their preferred location for a second university campus. When all levels of government work together, we really can achieve great things for our region. With $36 million in infrastructure funding from the federal government and the University of Newcastle, this announcement is certainly welcomed and something I have long advocated for. My dream is for Gosford to be known as an innovation city with a world-class university precinct, driving more opportunities for local residents, creating jobs and supporting enterprise. I'm advised by the university that planning for the project is well underway. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

After World War II it was key reforms initiated by Labor governments that saw education levels rise and the creation of the Australian National University. In the early 1990s, it was the Keating government that saw a massive increase in the school completion rate. Yet in last night's budget there was no increase to research block grants and nothing of note for the universities, save for one million dollars to support industry PhDs and some additional flexibility for student visa holders. For the Australian National University, this means they've lost one in 10 staff and potentially stand to see the closure of their neuroscience department.

                  </a>  As Brian Schmidt has pointed out, the hit to universities' revenue could be in the billions of dollars. But the government can solve this. It needs to get vaccination and quarantine right; work with universities, not against them; set aside the culture wars; and invest in the productive capacity of the Australian economy. We need more investment in research rather than the mindless cuts that could see the Australian National University forced to close its neuroscience faculty. Labor will be on the side of universities. We call on the government to do the same.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  I rise to welcome a budget initiative for the Goldfields region of my electorate. Located in the outback 600 kilometres east of Perth, Kalgoorlie-Boulder has seen many engineering breakthroughs overcome the tyranny of distance. First there was the Goldfields pipeline, engineered by CY O'Connor, after whom my electorate was named. Piping precious water from Perth, O'Connor effectively enabled the gold rush of the 1890s. Then, in 1917, the rail gauge was standardised east of Kalgoorlie, connecting the railways of east Australia and Western Australia for the first time. Today, however, a rail bottleneck is hindering mining companies and processing industries from transporting their product to port. But that will hopefully change.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday Treasurer Frydenberg announced $2 million to assess the feasibility of the Kalgoorlie rail realignment project. A realigned track would service a multimodal transport hub plan for Kalgoorlie's western suburbs. Last week in Kalgoorlie I chaired a high-level meeting of processing, mining and transporting businesses that overwhelmingly support the realignment. Major resource companies including Northern Star, Lynas Rare Earths, Beacon Minerals and Adelaide Brighton were all represented. They all indicated they would benefit from the project and agreed it would be a major boost for the Goldfields economy. I take this opportunity to thank the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder for their great work in support of this proposal. I also congratulate all the parties for coming together to help make the Kalgoorlie rail realignment project a reality.</span>

I'm sure I speak for all Australians when I say that any loss of civilian lives is heartbreaking and unacceptable. It is especially a tragedy when we see children become victims of a cycle of violence. We all want to see this violence end, and we want to see de-escalation from all sides. Violence begets violence, but I want to be very clear: there is no justification for targeting innocent civilians or using them as human shields. There is no justification for the actions of Hamas, recognised by Australia as a terrorist organisation, firing a barrage of rockets and missiles at Israel, at civilian populations in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, at schools, hospitals and homes.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have friends and family who spent much of last night in bomb shelters alongside the constant blaring of sirens and rockets that were incoming. I know that so many of my constituents have heard the same distressing stories from their family and friends. If rockets were being fired at Melbourne, Sydney or Canberra, there is no doubt the Australian Defence Force would be responding in the same way. The great tragedy is that many of these rockets fired by Hamas have misfired or fallen short and killed innocent Palestinian people. The violence needs to end; the rockets need to stop; the cycle of violence will never be solved by more violence. I continue to hold hope that one day we will see a true, lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  The 80th anniversary of the siege of Tobruk was marked on 10 April this year. Of the 14,000 men who became our Rats of Tobruk, 1,400 were from Tasmania, a significant number of men from a small island state. A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting Kaye Ross at a community morning tea I hosted at the George Town RSL Sub-Branch. Kaye is a proud descendant of four Rats of Tobruk, one of whom was killed at the tender age of 19, and another taken as a prisoner of war for 3½ years before escaping and walking across the Alps to Switzerland and freedom.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a committee member of the Descendants of the Rats of Tobruk Association, Kaye has spent the last few years assisting in the organisation of a world reunion for the 80th anniversary event, to be held in Brisbane. A significant part of Kaye's role was painstakingly recreating 200 comfort packs to distribute at the event—replicas of packs sent to our troops in World War II. Included were sachets of tea and bars of chocolate similar to what would have been available for families to send to their loved ones all those years ago. Sadly, with the sudden COVID restrictions put in place in Brisbane just before Easter, the reunion was cancelled and, as such, the packs are still sitting in George Town waiting to be sent out. I'm working with Kaye to ensure that these packs can be distributed as intended. I hope the postponed reunion gets off the ground later this year.</span>

It's just a shameless political fix. Despite racking up a record trillion dollars in debt, there's no plan to fix the housing crisis. On the New South Wales North Coast we have a housing affordability crisis and we need urgent action now. With rental vacancies at just 0.3 per cent in our area, our community is hurting and needs national leadership to address the issue. Every day locals raise with me the issue of the housing crisis. We simply have no affordable housing in our region. We need support and solutions to fix this situation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the problem is that the Morrison government is not listening. They're not listening to locals who just can't get into the housing market, because of soaring prices. They're not listening to the families who can't find affordable rentals or are forced to leave their homes, because their rents skyrocket overnight. This government isn't listening to the people who can't find crisis accommodation, like women who are fleeing domestic violence and have nowhere to go.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the people of the North Coast: Labor is listening. The entire Labor team are fighting for action to fix this crisis. While state and local governments have an important role, the fact is we need national leadership and we need it now. We need a national housing and homelessness plan, and that's exactly what an Albanese Labor government will deliver. In times like these, you can depend on me to fight for you. Every day I'm on your side, always fighting for you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  The Redcliffe Dolphins, or the 'Moreton Bay Dolphins', which is what I'm hoping they will be called in the future, are on a quest to become the second Brisbane NRL team, and I'm backing them all the way. The Dolphins' NRL bid is based on a passion and a desire to give their players the opportunity to compete at the highest level of rugby league in the NRL, the greatest competition of all, and to give their 40,000 members and supporters a chance to proudly cheer their team on from the sidelines. If their bid is successful, which I'm very hopeful it will be, the Dolphins will become the NRL's 17th team. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Dolphins have an impressive history under their belt with the Brisbane community, which goes all the way back 74 years to the grassroots of rugby league. The Dolphins club was founded in 1947, and their first-grade team played in the Brisbane rugby league competition from 1960, joining the Queensland Cup when it started in 1996. As of today, they've appeared in 11 grand finals, won six premierships and are the most successful Queensland Cup club. There was a proud moment for the Dolphins last year when the new northern grandstand of Dolphin Stadium in Redcliffe was opened in late September. The grandstand was made possible by and was constructed using $500,000 from the federal government's Community Sport Infrastructure Grants Program for the construction of its female facilities, $3 million from the Community Development Grants Program, as well as $2.5 million from the Moreton Bay Regional Council. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish the Dolphins luck on their NRL bid and look forward to attending their first NRL game when the time comes. Go the Dolphins!</span>

Instead of immediately organising repatriation flights and quarantine facilities to get these stranded Aussies home, what is the Prime Minister's first course of action? He criminalises them. He threatens to lock them up if they try to return home. How deeply unpatriotic. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Indian community was the first in line to lend a hand during the bushfires when the Prime Minister was off holidaying in Hawaii. Anita and Parminder and the Hindu Society of Queensland in Boondall rallied together to send food and financial donations to communities devastated by the bushfires. Now, our Indian Australians need our support more than ever before, and the Morrison government are turning their backs on them. </span>

The COVID rate in Delhi is 19.1 per cent, with 12,651 new cases in just the past few hours. There are bodies washing up in the Ganges. There are makeshift crematoriums set up in the street. They are running out of oxygen. Indian Australians need urgent action from the Morrison government, not a total breach of faith and duty. I will continue to represent, fight for and support you. </span>

I'm especially pleased to see the reinvigoration of the creative and cultural sectors in my electorate of Bonner, with the Wynnum Fringe Festival recently awarded $236,000 in funding thanks to the Morrison government's RISE Fund. The funding awarded to this festival means it can return as an annual event on the Bayside. It will also enable Bonner's local artists to get back on stage, and for the community to experience the arts right in their own backyards. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege of personally congratulating festival founder, artistic director and Bonner constituent, Tom Oliver, on securing this funding. With an impressive background in the arts, the festival was an idea created by Tom last year after seeing how hard-hit the sector was. Tom couldn't have been more pleased to receive this funding for the festival, especially after seeing firsthand the remarkable outcomes it delivered to the arts sector and local economy following last year's first event. With this funding, the event will be returning even bigger and better in November this year. This government understands that, by investing in the community and events like the Wynnum Fringe Festival, you are also investing in the passion and livelihoods of all. I am honoured to be part of the Morrison government. What a great feeling it is to see the continued reinvigoration of communities across all sectors.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, we saw hefty levels of spending declared for regional Australia in glossy budget brochures: $15 billion over 10 years for rail and road projects, a quarter of a billion dollars dropped into the coffers of the Building Better Regions Fund, $130 million into the regional connectivity fund for NBN and mobile black spots, and $630 million to improve access to aged care in the regions—with no detail about how that will actually happen. The Treasurer might be denying it, but the government have the next election firmly in sight with this budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On face value, these announcements sound great. I've been calling for this level of investment in regional aged care, infrastructure and telecommunications since I was elected. The pent-up demand in my electorate of Indi is massive. It's crucial that we don't leave the regions behind as the economy starts to lift. We must have reliable connectivity. We must have great transport. We must have equitable health care. But if we spend big we have to spend smart. And I'm not convinced that the way the government is doling out cash gives us the best bang for our buck. I'm not convinced that there is any semblance of a plan or any measures or targets for success. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First up, we've got no strategy for regional Australia whatsoever. I sit on the Select Committee on Regional Australia, as do many of my colleagues who'll be speaking on this motion in this chamber. That committee has been calling on this government to write a white paper for the regions for over half a decade now. In that time, not one federal government minister has lifted a pen to initiate one. A white paper would consult deeply. It would look objectively at opportunities for growth and prosperity in the regions and identify game-changing, long-term investments. Right now, all we seem to get are ministerial pet projects and slush funds that scattergun funding with no clear rhyme nor reason. Without a strategy, we're simply riding blind. We have no targets for what success looks like. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, we've got no integrity commission. I was gobsmacked to see zero dollars and zero staff given to the government's promised integrity commission last night. This government has all but abandoned its election commitment on integrity, at a time when billions of dollars in public funds are going out the door. This is simply unacceptable, and people in regional Australia find it simply unacceptable too. In the lead-up to the last election, the Building Better Regions Fund awarded 94 per cent of grants to coalition seats or marginal seats targeted by the coalition, and the Auditor-General is preparing to conduct a performance audit of the Building Better Regions Fund this year. I'll be watching that very closely, and I'll be watching this new $250 million very closely too before the next election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, we have no way of tracking announcements and making sure they turn into real results on the ground. More than 85 per cent of the $700 million promised for regional aged care last night won't hit the ground until after the next election. Families whose loved ones are affected by aged-care shortages in towns of my electorate—towns like Bright, Euroa and Alexandra—don't care about big announcements. What they care about is delivery on the ground, more residential aged-care beds in their own towns, not having to drive hours down the road. They care about knowing that their loved ones will have skilled nurses and carers by their side. That's why I introduced the budget honesty bill last sitting. That bill would make sure everyday people could track announcements and see if the government gloss was turning into real results for their communities and towns. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indi knows what undelivered election promises look like. Right before the last election, this government committed $64 million to a hero project outside Wodonga: the McKoy Street overpass. A year on, with no plans developed and no shovels in the ground, the government announced another $104 million in the October budget. Wodonga waited another six months only to learn on Monday that the government needs until 2022 before it even gets started. Announcements mean nothing unless they deliver. Later this week I'll launch a budget survey asking my constituents what they think of the budget and I'll be meeting with the Prime Minister and ministers to raise the concerns of the people of Indi. The glossies are nice, but our regions deserve and rightfully expect real results. </span>

Certainly the inquiry that was held that the member for Indi refers to was one that I had the honour of chairing at the end. It was also chaired by Dr McVeigh, now a minister, and Minister Darren Chester also had a role in it, but at the end it was left to me to present this report to the parliament. This committee has rolled over into the current parliament and is now chaired by Tony Pasin from South Australia, and the role that he is doing is very good. It's incredible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the big issues surrounding regional Australia and making sure that regional Australia gets its share of development funds are based solely on the concept that, if we just sit and look at the spend of government—not just the federal government but the spend of state governments as well—we see that the amount of money for infrastructure that is spent in the regions is absolutely dwarfed by the amount of money that is spent in the cities. The member for Indi said she's going to be making sure that not too much money gets spent in the regions. She just has to understand that the coalition tends to hold most of the seats in regional and rural Australia. If it weren't for funds like the Building Better Regions Fund then regional Australia would get even less. Here's a member representing a regional area, effectively holding the government to ransom saying, 'Make sure you don't give too much money to regional Australia.' This is really worrying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that we identified in the previous committee was the impact and the power of catalytic investments—investments that then lead to other investments. It's fine for governments to build a local town hall, but what's the town hall going to generate? What we saw throughout the previous inquiry were these projects that, once funded by government, then led to a whole string of private funding and then add-on projects that would all pile on. All of a sudden you could see where the benefits that started with some government support then led to a whole avalanche of private investment. We saw some of the power of the city deals. In particular, the best one that we got the opportunity to see was the one in Launceston, where we had university money and we had local government money mixed in with state government funding and then topped off with federal funding. That's the way to do a city deal where everybody gets involved, including the private sector. Again, these projects were all flushed out by the inquiry that produced <span style="font-style:italic;">Regions at the ready</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They were driven by the concept that in Australia we have more or less let the population live where they want to live, as we should in a First World country, but we've ended up with 40 per cent of our population in Australia living in two cities. This is not normal. This is not right. If we had an opportunity to plan better then we would have. With 40 per cent of our population living in two destinations, it's very difficult for any region based party such as the Nationals to make sure that they get their fair share of funding and make sure that the amenities, the facilities and the infrastructure that are available for the people who live in rural and regional Australia in some way match that which is given to the people who live in Melbourne and Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 1 was predominantly about making sure that the federal government continues to invest, and increases its investment, in building enabling infrastructure, making sure that we connect those key services and amenities through coordinated regional plans. The work that Nola Marino has done in bringing the Regional Development Australia committees to another level of coordination and strategic project work has been incredibly consistent with recommendation 1. We have made sure that all of these strategic plans are, in fact, published and that there is this catalytic driver in amongst these plans that the RDAs are working through. The work that Nola Marino has been doing is really commendable. The first thing we had to do with the RDAs was take the politics out of them, because it was the politics that seeped into the Regional Development Australia committees that ruined them in the first place. The Regional Development Australia committees at the moment are continuing to do good work, and I commend the work that we've done in the last two parliaments. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  One thing I find amazing in a lot of these speeches on regional Australia is that it's almost as if those opposite haven't been the government for eight years. You would have thought that, with eight years to properly and strategically plan things like decentralisation and other much-announced initiatives, we would have seen a bit of action by now, but there are a heap of ways in which the government, those opposite, have failed regional Australia. It's been a failure of strategy, but also, I think—and we saw it last night in the budget—it's been a failure of imagination. There's been a failure to plan for the future of our regions, which is vital if we are going to have a sustainable growth trajectory and strong development of our regional areas to make Australia a truly great country. It's no great surprise that those opposite had to be dragged kicking and screaming by the Senate to even release their Australia's regions report, more than two years after they received it from the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation. They've been in government for eight years and had to be dragged kicking and screaming for two years to actually deliver it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That could be because they've got no vision for the regions. That was shown today in question time when I asked the Deputy Prime Minister if it was true—and it certainly was—that only one per cent of the new infrastructure funds to be spent in the NT were to be spent over the forward estimates, over four years. So we've got eight years of neglect and now another four years where only one per cent of new infrastructure funds are going to be spent over the forward estimates. You can't run this country and neglect a sixth of the land mass. You can't pretend to stand up for regions when one per cent of the new infrastructure funding for the Northern Territory is going to be spent within the next four years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there's no vision in the budget. Australia's been saddled with a record debt by those opposite, the government. There's a great graph going around on social media at the moment. I recommend you have a look, because it puts paid to the absurdity that we heard from those opposite when we were last in government, when there was a global financial crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What would have been great for regional Australia including the Northern Territory, besides having more than one per cent of new infrastructure spending over the forward estimates, would have been the realisation of the announcement, in the last federal election, of a bit over $200 million for Kakadu. We haven't seen it, and it would really have come in handy in the last 15 months, or since the last federal election. If we could have used those funds to make sure that Kakadu was good to go for this boom we're seeing in domestic tourism. We're going to have a great dry season. It would have been great if the promises made at the last federal election had been honoured.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of social infrastructure, we had more announcements from those opposite—$5 million for a veterans wellbeing centre. And then, when the budget came last night, nothing—zip. Those opposite basically can't be trusted. If they rock into your electorate during an election campaign and make a commitment, it's not honoured. There is no honour. Regional Australians scratch their heads and go, 'They announce a lot and they've told us they're going to do things for us in the regions in terms of social infrastructure, which is badly missing, but we've been dudded on the NBN.' We say this quite a bit, but it's because it's true: there's always the photo-op, always the announcement, but never the follow-up on the ground. That's disappointing to me as someone who represents people in regional Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of things that could happen in the Top End in terms of social infrastructure. One of them is a youth hub that's badly needed. I will continue to put those ideas, as others have, to the federal government, and hope that they start doing something for regional areas in this country.</span>

These events have had profound impacts on our regional communities and have changed our way of life. For instance, because we have no backpackers, no immigration and no seasonal workers from the Pacific islands, we are very short of labour to pick our crops. As a result, this government still awaits the findings of a number of inquiries that are underway at this very point in time, and is looking at issues affecting regional Australia now before committing to any particular course of action. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  I stand to support the motion moved by the member for Indi. Before I get into the substance of it, I just want to come to the point that the member for Flynn raised about the Building Better Regions Fund. It must be noted that 27 projects in the latest Building Better Regions Fund announcement went to just four seats held by the coalition. It won't surprise me if we see the renaming of this scheme to either 'building better margins' or 'building better rorting', because certainly there are a lot of regional communities missing out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The continual and unfettered disrespect shown by this government towards the vast majority of regional Australia, except perhaps in the seats they hold, is why I speak today. Not a day goes by when I'm not shocked and appalled by the government's blatant disregard for regional communities. Last night's budget demonstrated just how little this government really cares about the regions. They're talking big on infrastructure, for example, but the detail exposes a $3.3 billion cut. There's nothing really in this budget for the regions. There's certainly nothing in this budget for Tasmania. It talks about $322 million for roads in Tasmania, but, in reality, next year in 2021-22 only $4 million will be spent on roads by the federal government in Tasmania. That's an absolute disgrace; $226 million of the $322 million is on the never-never. It's not even in the forward estimates. It's an absolute con. This budget is a massive con job on the people of Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Support for Tasmanian tourism has been cut, but that's form for this government. It talks a big game on the regions. It looks the part. It wears the check shirts, the boots and the big hats, but it doesn't actually deliver the services on the ground. In my electorate I have seen the failures of this government take root, with small towns getting smaller and young Tasmanians leaving regional communities because there's no clear future for them. There are not enough jobs, not enough services and not enough opportunities for them to hold onto. They can't see a future in their regions, because Liberal governments are really not concerned about the regions. They're concerned about the big corporations, the big banks and the big multinationals. Banks are closing in the regions. ATMs are being ripped out of our towns. Government agencies are closing, with pensioners in the regions told to go online to get assistance. They're being ignored and neglected, and they're getting frustrated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the government that refused to publicly release the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's regions: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvesting in their future</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>report until forced to do so. Why? Because there's no investment in Australia's regions. This is the government which made no commitment to developing a white paper or feasible strategy to advance regional Australia, as the member for Indi points out in her motion. We need to get serious about rebuilding our regions as places to live, to work, to raise a family and to retire with decent quality services and experiences. Regional Australians and regional Tasmanians are tired of being treated as afterthoughts. This is the government that just this week tried to recycle promises for Tasmanian roads and resell them as brand-new. So not only is the $322 million funding announcement a mirage—because it's only $4 million next year—but the vast majority of the package was announced years ago; it has just been repackaged this year. It's not even new money. There's nothing for Tasmania in this budget. It's a reannounced mirage.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate is a regional one, and much of it is rural at that. I'm proud to represent my constituents and their homes, for it's my home also. There is so much natural beauty, so many incredible destinations and such a strong community spirit that binds it all together. From Bay of Fires in the state's north-east all the way down to Maydena in the Derwent Valley, my electorate includes farms, fields, stunning coastlines and islands, national parks, places sacred to traditional owners, and heritage listed colonial towns. It's beautiful all the way through, but it has its challenges as a regional area, and we know what those challenges are. They're the lack of services, the centralisation of services into the cities and the lack of employment opportunities. They have so much to offer, and none of it would be possible without the work of the volunteers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I close, I have to shout out the incredible work that the volunteers do. They are the glue that holds regional communities together, and, frankly, they are exploited by this government, because a lot of what they do should be done by paid staff.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  Firstly, I'd like to thank the member for Indi for bringing this motion forward. It gives us an opportunity to talk about many good things in regional Australia. I was a bit surprised by her speech, though, when she talked about the lack of action. I vehemently disagree. In fact, I can remember being so envious of Indi when the Mobile Black Spot Program was first announced. Indi outscored virtually every other electorate in Australia, so it's not underserviced at all. It did have a different member then, but there you go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am the member for Grey, and I'd rate Grey as just about as regional as you get. My region—or regions—covers 92 per cent of South Australia, an area 10 per cent bigger than New South Wales. So I know about regions and I know about government investment in regions. I've lived in that region, if you like, for all of my 64 years, and I've never seen government investment in it like we're seeing at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard a bit of a tale lately that the grants programs are rigged around marginal seats. The last time I looked, Grey was a bit over 13 per cent on a two-party preferred basis to the Liberal Party, and yet there is over a billion dollars of investment in our road network coming from the Commonwealth government at the moment. I wouldn't call that pork-barrelling into a regional electorate. I would say that is resisting the view that you don't get paid out unless you live in a marginal electorate. I've never seen works like this. We're building a new bridge in Port Augusta, a duplication on the main thoroughfare from Sydney to Perth. It's also the main thoroughfare from Adelaide to Darwin. We're building an overpass facility and dual lanes through Port Wakefield, which is a town to the south where the roads meet. We're starting the duplication of the Augusta Highway. We're doing a $100 million upgrade on the Eyre Highway. We've seen more than $50 million of work go into the Barrier Highway and more than that into the Horrocks Highway. So there are things happening right across Grey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've just seen in this budget an extension of the special local roads component for South Australian councils which actually recognises the fact that they got dudded in the national deal that was done over 20 years ago. It's been there for most of that time, but, every time it comes up, we have to argue for it again. It wasn't funded at the end of the Labor government, so it fell into disrepair for a couple of years, but we managed to get it back on the burner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeing investment in a whole lot of areas across Grey through things like the on-farm water grants, which are enabling farmers to get their production platforms in place and make them relative to today. We're seeing over 30 mobile phone towers go in under the Black Spot Program across Grey. These are fantastic outcomes. In the budget which has just been announced, we saw an actual growth in the on-farm water grants. There's more support for local shows—which have taken a bashing through the COVID virus; none of my local shows ran for 12 months—and it's warmly welcomed. The instant asset write-offs for all businesses right across Australia, but certainly in regional Australia and certainly in my part of the world, are making an enormous difference. We're seeing huge investment. You can barely buy a farm ute at the moment. It's really going off the scale in a big way. Those large contracts are bringing people into the regions. At the moment, there are no fewer than three wind farm constructions going on in Grey. These include battery storage, and solar cells to go with it. That doesn't happen on its own; it happens because the right levers are in place to make the investments occur. These are good outcomes for regional Australia. I would say we are in as bright a spot as we've been for some time. We have high prices, we have very good commodity results on just about everything, and the government is backing the regions in to keep multiplying that effect and growing the value thereof.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome your motion, as I say. I've been in this place for 13 years now, and there's never been a time when I've felt better about the government's treatment of people in the region. One of the things I've been hot about ever since I got here is the lack of doctors in the regions. We are as severely affected as any. As we saw in the budget, there is recognition of the fact that we need a different payment system for doctors that work in rural and regional areas, as opposed to those that work in the city. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="281988" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBAIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion and thank the member for Indi for bringing it to the chamber. Members of this place who have the joy of living in a regional community, as I do, know that whatever steps we take towards recovery must be focused on our regions. We also know that, for any recovery to be effective, it can't be based on how to win the next election or how to solve the next political problem. As I've consistently said since I was first elected, almost a year ago, we need a strategic, long-term plan to grow, support and transform our regions. As is pointed to in this motion, the only way to do that is to ensure that there is an amendment to the Charter of Budget Honesty that looks to the effect that the decisions that we make here have on our regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we currently hurtle towards a trillion dollars in debt, there is no plan for long-term, structural change in our regions—no vision, no consultation and no plan. I invite any member of this place to come to my region and see firsthand the need for change and the need for support in our communities. Come and talk to us. It's not much to ask. Talk to the people that live there. Talk to our local councils. Talk to the state governments about how we can work together. Our communities know best how to grow and create sustainable industries in our regions. They want you to listen to them on how to build career paths for our children and grandchildren. They want to make sure that there are services available to us all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I regularly travel right across the mighty Eden-Monaro. Our region spans some 42,000 square kilometres and contains 365 different towns and villages, one for every day of the year. In every town, on any day of the year that you were to show up, people would talk to you about the same issues that I will talk about today. One of the issues that is prevalent, from Dalmeny to Delegate, from Binalong to Bombala and from Murrumbateman to Michelago, is internet connectivity. Surely in 2021 we would be able to rely on a decent internet connection in our regional homes and businesses. But didn't you hear? The NBN is going to bring our regional towns and villages closer together to unlock their digital potential. At least that was the plan, until this government gutted the rollout and, in turn, gutted productivity in our regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's easy to forget that these decisions and the lack of a long-term, strategic plan have a real impact on our communities. Just last week I was speaking with Mary from Wallagoot. Mary runs an international furniture business from her home, employing a mix of local staff and remote staff in Indonesia. She's suffered from serious and ongoing internet outages, with poor and patchy service, and she has even considered relocating her business out of the region, to Canberra, to make sure that she doesn't lose clientele due to long periods of being uncontactable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has been all about announcements and flashy headlines, never about actually delivering for our regional communities. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts will proudly stand up and talk about the completed NBN rollout and how they've pushed so many more people to satellite or to fixed wireless, but what have they done in supporting our regional communities? I mean, Mary doesn't sound very supported to me. Why is it that internet connectivity in our regional towns and villages is not the main focus of our recovery?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have to look at infrastructure. Why is it that the government has failed to list more than one highway in my electorate as a road of strategic importance? There's only one major highway that this government contributes ongoing funding to. Is it the Princes Highway, which was severed both north and south during our bushfire crisis and closed for seven weeks, seriously impacting tourism and freight? No. Is it the Snowy Mountains Highway, the only major link between the Bega Valley and inland New South Wales? No. Is it the Monaro Highway, linking Cooma, Jindabyne and Bombala to Queanbeyan? No. Is it the Kings Highway, which was also closed for months following the Black Summer bushfires, linking Batemans Bay, Braidwood and Queanbeyan? No. It's the Barton Highway. And we're still waiting I don't know how many years on for the duplication of the Barton Highway. I don't know what it is about this, but all these roads are strategically important for growth and investment in our regions. But this is to be expected when you do not have a strategic plan for regional Australia. It's time to get on with it because our regions deserve better.</span>

                  <a href="240756" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  The member for Eden-Monaro has come to this place and encouraged people to visit her electorate, presumably members of the government or otherwise, to listen to her community. With respect, she ought to check her diary for Friday. If she did, she would realise that the House Select Committee on Regional Australia, which I chair, is conducting an inquiry into regional Australia and is in fact travelling to Eden-Monaro on Friday. We're not travelling there on Friday because, as the member suggests, she has asked but rather at my suggestion. And it's also not because she has come into this place and suggested otherwise. To come in here and try to suggest that the people who represent the government in this place are not willing to listen to her constituents is quite wrong, and I've just highlighted that very fact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about what we're in screaming agreement about. We're in screaming agreement, as I am with the member for Indi and my colleagues who represent regional Australia, about the importance of regional Australia to our nation. A strong regional Australia means a stronger Australia. I am in awe of the member for Indi's passion for the region, as I was her predecessor. We share a lot in common. But we have to be quite clear and clear-eyed about what we are doing. I didn't have the benefit of hearing, because I was in the House of Representatives during the member for Indi's contribution, but some have suggested that, in some way, this government has turned its back on regional Australia. I can tell you that that is not true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's difficult to debate this matter without reference to the events of last night. Of course, budget 2021 is a seminal point in the term of this government, but budget night is also significant in the life of any government. Just like elections shape the country, every single budget opportunity does exactly the same. I can't speak for every member of parliament, but what I can say is that constituents in my electorate woke up this morning to news that they are seeing part of the infrastructure pipeline delivered to Barker. I know the member for Grey was here making a contribution and talking about important infrastructure in his electorate. Let me tell you about the Truro bypass. It is a bottleneck on the Sturt Highway, which is a road of strategic importance. Not $1 million for a bypass around Truro, not $16 million, but $160 million. That is nation-building infrastructure. At the same time, there is funding to undertake studies in relation to other important transformative infrastructure. Through this budget there is a litany of announcements that will support regional communities. I'm particularly interested in the instant asset write-off and the bulk-billing incentive for GPs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think anyone in this place would be upset about the Building Better Regions Fund going for a further round, with an additional $250 million. In my electorate I've just been on a call to mayors and CEOs of the 17 councils. The one complaint I received about a further round of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program was, 'Tony, we're not sure we'll be able to roll out that program, because we are snowed with the amount of funding that's coming out of Canberra right now.' Answer: 'Well, this funding, round 3, will operate from 1 January 2022 through to 31 June 2023.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that is committed to regional Australia. Why? Because when you look across the chamber, the majority of people who come from regional Australia are on the government side of the benches. That's just the reality. As much as those opposite try to suggest there are more people from the Labor Party who represent rural, regional and remote communities, it is not true. And I remember one of the members who does live in regional Australia who represented the community of Ballarat and, when we were dealing with the National Stronger Regions Fund, what the ANAO said about that contribution. We're about regional Australia. We come from regional Australia. We know that a strong regional Australia makes for a strong Australia, and long may that be the case.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Indi for moving this very important motion regarding the regional Australia white paper, <span style="font-style:italic;">Regions at the ready: investing in Australia's future</span>. I can't think of a better thing that the government should be focusing on. Our regional areas are so important to Australia. I take exception to what the previous speaker said. I grew up on a dairy farm in a country area—six generations. I proudly stand here as the member for Gilmore. It is an absolute honour to represent people. But the reason I stood as a candidate and became the member for Gilmore was that I saw what was happening in our regions. I saw how our people were hurting and how they were missing out under 24 years with a Liberal member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget last night left a whole lot of things out, and I've got a lot of people in my electorate who are very, very unhappy. Here's an article from today, from the CEO of Waminda. Waminda is our South Coast Women's Health and Welfare Aboriginal Corporation, looking after Aboriginal women's health. They are a leader in what they do. They have lots of great programs aiming to improve health and educational outcomes for Aboriginal women as well as families. They have a lot of great programs, like Dead or Deadly. They have stroke prevention programs. They have programs that go into our schools. They have been trying to work with the government for years to create Birthing on Country. This would be an Australian first and would go a long way to reducing the Indigenous child mortality rate. So, they are very disappointed, and there's an article in my local paper today about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Health is probably the No. 1 issue in my electorate. We have a lot of elderly people, but of course health affects everyone, of all ages. A new Eurobodalla hospital is coming to Moruya, but there is concern that level 4 facilities are not going to be at the hospital. In the budget last night, funding was announced around mental health, and I always welcome funding around mental health. But the new Eurobodalla hospital needs an acute mental health unit—mental health inpatient beds. People are crying out for that. We also need a training facility so we can attract more health workers to our region. It's absolutely imperative. And radiology funding was promised under this government previously. Where is that? That's what people are asking me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And housing: on the New South Wales South Coast we have the worst housing crisis that anybody has ever seen. I have people coming into my office who cannot find a rental. We have the lowest rental availability in New South Wales. What do we say to them? There is nowhere to go. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got a letter here today from the Shoalhaven homelessness interagency. It says: 'The strain on our services, in being able to find alternative housing solutions, is increasing exponentially and is simply untenable. The chronic shortage of housing has been compounded by increasing rents in the private rental market, the appallingly low rate of JobSeeker, which limits people's ability to access housing, and a shortage of stock available through the public and community housing services.' What is this government doing about it? Nothing. They have no vision. That's what I take exception to. <span style="font-style:italic;">Regions at the ready: investing in Australia's future</span>—we should be looking after our greatest asset; that is, our people in the regions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got our roads, which are crippling around us. The duplication of the Princes Highway is absolutely paramount. That definitely needs more funding. We have a lot of different roads, like the Araluen Road. We've gone through the bushfires, four disaster-declared floods, COVID—you name it, we've really seen it all. We don't even have an emergency operations centre in Moruya. They were working out of a hall with trestle tables from Bunnings. How does that happen? We've got the national disaster mitigation fund and we've got communities crying out for support. This government needs to get serious and start helping regional Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  The motion before the chamber speaks to the Morrison-McCormack government's plan for regional Australia. I can assure the chamber that our government has a plan for regional and rural Australia, including in my electorate of Mallee. Last year the government delivered the most significant budget in Australian history, in the middle of a global pandemic. It was also the most significant budget regional Australia has ever seen. Last night we went further and in this year's budget we've doubled down on our commitment to regional communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Mallee, which is the most regional electorate in Victoria, I have been listening to my communities. That's why I'm focused on, firstly: greater access to health care; better roads, infrastructure and connectivity; the workforce that we need; building the skills for tomorrow; thriving regional industries and small businesses; our environment; and planning for the future. These are my priorities for Mallee, and this budget is delivering for Mallee and for all of regional Australia. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're investing $65.8 million to increase the rural bulk-billing incentive for doctors working in rural towns and remote areas. Doctors working in our towns along the Mallee Track will receive a 30 per cent increase in their bulk-billing rates. This measure will reward regional doctors for their contribution to regional communities. We're also providing a further $206 million to extend telehealth services, bringing our total investment to $3.6 billion to date. In Mallee there have been 417,879 telehealth consultations, through Medicare, since the start of the pandemic. Investments in telehealth represent extraordinary value for money in Mallee. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this year's budget, the government is making record investments in aged care and mental health. We're committing an additional $17.7 billion for aged care on top of our existing investment. This will mean the creation of an additional 80,000 home-care packages over the next two years, bringing the total to 275,000. Our National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan is committing $2.3 billion for prevention, early intervention, treatment, workforce and support for the vulnerable. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison-McCormack government is securing Australia's recovery with a record investment in infrastructure as part of this year's budget. In Mallee, our roads are crucial to our economic survival and the health of our communities. We're committing an additional $15 million to the Calder Highway between Melbourne and Mildura, on top of the $60 million that is already committed on that corridor. We're providing an additional $1 billion for our $3 billion Road Safety Program. The government is continuing its support for local infrastructure projects that improve our communities and regional towns. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year, I wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer to inform them of several priority projects in each of the 12 local government areas in my electorate. The Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer have listened to my call for an extension of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program and have committed to another round of the Building Better Regions Fund. Mallee councils will share in $37.3 million under the third tranche of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, which is more than they received in rounds 1 and 2 combined. Several priority projects in each council can be delivered with this funding, and the BBRF has been increased to $250 million this round to support even more infrastructure projects.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is building the skills of tomorrow and delivering for our thriving regional industries and small businesses. We're committing $1.5 billion to extend the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy for an additional six months. There are 2,155 apprentices currently being supported in Mallee under this 50 per cent wage subsidy, and I expect this number will grow. More funding is being provided to the successful JobTrainer Fund, which supports free or low-fee training places in areas of skills need. Around 33,000 people will be supported to develop the skills needed to work in aged care. Our government is also extending the instant asset write-off measure for a further 12 months, a measure that has been hugely popular in Mallee. This means around 20,900 businesses in Mallee can write-off the full value of any eligible asset they purchase. This government has a plan for Mallee communities and is delivering on our commitments.</span>

I'm proud of our government's track record in protecting our oceans and marine system. In fact, former Prime Minister John Howard created the world's first oceans policy, in 1998, and it was a coalition government that established one of the world's largest representative networks of protected marine parks. Just last year, our budget included an oceans package of $67.4 million being invested to protect our oceans and marine ecosystems. This includes $14.8 million to tackle the marine impacts of ghost nets and plastic litter throughout the waters of northern Australia. Additionally with a marine park network of 3.3 million square kilometres, larger than the nation of Argentina, $28 million will be spent to enhance the management of our marine parks. And, building on Australia's international leadership in this space, $4.2 million will be invested for international blue carbon and rainforest partnerships that protect coastal and rainforest ecosystems.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also committed to not only preserving and protecting our marine ecosystem but also achieving a sustainable ocean economy. When our ocean is protected and sustainably managed it has the potential to deliver significant economic and social benefits. As we look to recover from COVID-19, a healthy and sustainably managed ocean can bring economic relief and make our regional communities stronger. There is no better example of this than the Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre located in Northern Tasmania. The Blue Economy CRC is a 10-year research project with $329 million in funding, including $70 million in federal government funding. It is led by the University of Tasmania, bringing together expertise in seafood, renewable energy and offshore engineering to transform our country's blue economy.</span>

Over the project term, the CRC will support a research community of around 50 PhD students and 50 postdoctoral research fellows throughout the state. The first five years of the program, currently underway, is focusing on the development and testing of new offshore aquaculture and renewable energy technologies, which will then be brought together on a single platform to demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits of co-location. Over 17 projects have been completed so far, with a further nine currently underway.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that the ocean supports almost 400,000 jobs in Australia and by 2025 we expect ocean industries to contribute $100 billion to our nation every single year. When we protect our ocean, we protect both our environment and our economic growth. That's why last night's budget included an additional $100 million for the Oceans Leadership Package, which will build on our strong position as leaders and custodians of a great marine nation. This significant investment includes $39.9 million to go towards reinforcing Australia's position as a world leader in marine park management, $11.6 million to be delivered over two years to incorporate sea country in Indigenous protected areas in nine locations to provide Indigenous communities with real economic and employment opportunities as well as contribute to the conservation of environmental and cultural values within these marine areas and $30.6 million of investment in practical action to restore and account for blue-carbon ecosystems. This will improve the health of coastal environments in Australia and around the region and export Australia's internationally recognised expertise in ocean accounting while boosting regional employment and enabling us to account for the value of these habitats as blue-carbon repositories. There is $18 million to protect marine species, improve fisheries' sustainability through reducing biocatch, and stimulate investment in our oceans.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  I thank the member for Bass for bringing this motion. It's true that we desperately need to do a much better job of protecting our oceans; like our ecosystems on land, our marine environment has suffered significant harm and is under enormous pressure. In fact, it may be that the direct effect of climate change has already been more profound for our oceans, which have absorbed more than 90 per cent of the additional heat caused by human activity. As a shock absorber, however, the oceans have reached their limit, and a great deal of damage has already been done. The devastating forest or bushfires we've seen in Australia, California and the Amazon have their scorching corollary below the surface in the coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef and the heatwaves that have wiped out great submarine fields of seagrass and kelp in Western Australia and Tasmania. For all these reasons, it's utterly wrong for us to think that oceans worldwide are in good shape, and we shouldn't kid ourselves that Australia's oceans are a particular exception. The truth is our ocean can't absorb much more human produced carbon dioxide. It's getting hotter and more acidic. It's been shot through with billions of particles of microplastic. Marine ecosystems have been disrupted, and marine species are getting pushed closer to the edge of extinction. Just last week it was reported that Australia's only endemic species of sea lion has decreased 60 per cent in the last few decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All those pressures—climate change, ocean plastic, harmful fishing practices—have been neglected by this Liberal government, and it's utterly wrong and quite ridiculous for anyone to claim that this third-term Liberal government has looked after our oceans or done much to show leadership on the global stage. This is a Liberal government that began eight years ago by ripping holes in Labor's national network of marine protected areas and a government that introduced a Threatened Species Strategy which is badly off-track, which is late and which, in any case, never included a single marine species. It is a government that only woke up to the waste crisis when plastic stockpiles caught on fire and other countries refused to accept our low-grade, contaminated mixed plastic. It is a Liberal government that's cut funds to the CSIRO yet wasted funds on the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. It tells you everything you need to know about this government that its signature manoeuvre in the marine protection space was to give $450 million to friends in the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. That was money that was never asked for and funding that had no clear structural purpose to guide it, at a time when the reef has been hammered by bleaching events in five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, in this budget, there is belatedly some funding for oceans. Any support is welcome, especially with respect to strengthening the marine parks network that this government began savagely cutting eight years ago. But, whenever we see a flashy announcement from this government, we need to remember its record on delivery. In 2019, they announced $15 million for the Pacific Ocean Litter Project to tackle plastic pollution in our region, yet we discover through Senate estimates that less than $1 million has been applied since that time, and none of that has been delivered in practical waste reduction measures.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In any consideration of the government's environmental record, the biggest glitch has to be its awful failure to reform the EPBC Act in line with the recommendations of the independent reviewer, whose foundation assessment is that Australia's environment is in poor shape, with a trajectory of further decline. The reviewer has provided a sensible recipe for reform: introduce clear and in some cases uncompromising national standards, and put in place an independent watchdog with real clout. Mr Samuel even provided a draft set of standards, including a set specifically for marine protection. But the government has so far totally ignored that work. It has thrown all that work, consultation and expertise on the floor. It has said there will be no independent compliance watchdog and has since backtracked only as far as creating a commissioner with no scope to examine individual environmental protection matters and no real independence, even though the ANAO found that 79 per cent of EPBC decisions involved failures of compliance. The government's proposed standards have completely ignored those put forward by Mr Samuel. They are the same ineffective standards that currently exist under the same failed EPBC protection framework that we have presently.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians understand the literally vital importance of healthy oceans for us and for our fellow human beings around the planet. Our oceans produce the oxygen we breathe, they regulate our climate, they provide seafood that can be sustainably fished, and they sustain an incredible range of biodiversity that we have a duty to maintain and to protect. This government has weakened ocean protection, failed to improve the position of endangered marine species, squibbed the opportunity to reform the EPBC Act, refused to take climate change seriously, and been complacent about the waste crisis that sees tonnes of plastic going into our waterways and, ultimately, the sea. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  Deputy Speaker Wallace, it's lovely to see you in the chair this afternoon, and it's a great pleasure to be able to speak on this important motion. When we think about the principles of liberalism that motivate me and our party, there are many things. We believe in people's freedom to be able to pursue their own lives and opportunities and in empowering individual citizens to be able to live out the fullness of their success; we believe in responsibility to each other and our sense of mutualism to make sure that we can live out our lives understanding our obligation to each other; and, critically, we also believe in stewardship of our natural environment to make sure that we pass on to future generations as good an environment as we inherited, if not better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great legacies of economic development and environmental conservation in this country is that, because we are a prosperous nation, we're able not just to afford environmental conservation protection but actually to go back and undo the damage of generations past. I would have thought that's something that we should be enormously proud of, and it's a core part of the focus of the Morrison government and its environmental policies in all sorts of areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, today we're talking about conservation of our marine ecosystems. This is incredibly important to me. Deputy Speaker Wallace, I know you used to live in the Goldstein electorate. You've got that wry smile on your face. You know it to be true, even though you try and hide it in your bunker on the Sunshine Coast. When you lived in Goldstein, you knew—living in a suburb near the one where I live—that the beauty of the Goldstein electorate is that it is hugged by Port Phillip. Port Phillip is our greatest local natural asset. It includes, of course, a huge amount of ecosystems and biodiversity and, of course, it is also part of the recreational retreat that makes us the most livable community in the country—even if some people abandon us from time to time, Deputy Speaker!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of that is having the Ricketts Point Marine Sanctuary. The Ricketts Point Marine Sanctuary is a local ecosystem which provides for lots of different aquaculture and diversity within our community, which enables people to go and see the full benefits of our local waterways. One of the things that we've done, as a local community, is focus on what it is we need to do to address the issues of pollution and run-off into Port Phillip, which has an impact on our local beaches. Late last year, we held a water forum—in fact, working cooperatively with the member for Macnamara, to his credit. He and I share responsibility for Elsternwick Park and Elster Creek, which flows into the Elwood canal, which becomes the pathway for the run-off that leads to environmental pollution in Port Phillip. We held a water forum to bring together the interest groups to look at what we need to do to fix the issues in environmental pollution and run-off into Port Phillip so that we have a healthier local environment. That's what we're doing at the local level, with a sense of stewardship and responsibility to the community that I love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the broader agenda, we're also focusing on protecting the Great Barrier Reef. I heard the earlier derisive comments by the Labor members who spoke about the fact that we've committed $450 million to the conservation of the Great Barrier Reef. I'm immensely proud that we've done that. In comparison, the previous Labor government did not prioritise the conservation of the Great Barrier Reef and were not mindful of the impact on future generations being able to enjoy our beautiful marine parks. We've made it a pillar and a focus of what we're doing. We've done so because we understand the contribution it makes to our tourist industry, though that isn't the sole reason. We understand what it does to our marine ecosystems and to the health and wellbeing of the surrounding territories, and we understand our obligation and responsibility, not just to the Australian continent and the Australian people but to the global community, to take care of our natural environment. But we also understand that it is critically important to take care of the Great Barrier Reef because it is a marine park that has so much going for it, and we want to celebrate its success. So, yes, we absolutely have committed $450 million towards its conservation, because we have had bleaching events and we want to address that and repair the damage that's been done in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, that's part of a long legacy of initiatives by the Liberal and National parties focusing on environmental stewardship. We have reduced pollution, and in fact John Howard's government was the first government to create an oceans policy, in 1998. It's consistent— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  Our environment and our livelihoods depend upon a clean ocean. Indeed, this government predicts Australia's ocean industry will contribute approximately $100 billion to the economy each year by 2025, supporting close to 400,000 jobs. My electorate of Mayo fronts some of the most prime marine real estate in Australia. Ecotourism and fishing contribute significantly to our regional economy, from dolphin tours on Kangaroo Island to fishing charters. Our seaside towns are also popular tourism destinations, and, with COVID restrictions driving domestic travel, our coastal communities are certainly bouncing back. So it was pleasing to see support for our marine environment in this week's budget, with a $100 million package for ocean protection. The funding will go towards ocean management methods and drawing carbon out of the atmosphere using seagrass, salt marshes and mangroves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Blue carbon is a natural phenomenon of carbon capture and storage. As an island nation, blue carbon offers enormous scope for addressing our emissions. Our seagrass meadows and mangroves retain carbon at rates of up to four times greater than land based forests. Australia has millions of hectares of these ecosystems. As one of the co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Climate Action, I'm keen to raise awareness with respect to blue carbon, and I'm hosting a friends event in August, inviting a bright young woman from my electorate, Michaela Schwartz, to come along and speak. Michaela is an expert in blue carbon and seagrasses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the marine protection package also includes $20 million to re-establish native oyster reefs at 11 sites across the nation. A few of these reefs are in South Australia, and one of them is in my electorate, on Kangaroo Island. The environmental and economic benefits of restoring these reefs are well documented. Nature Conservancy Australia estimates that, for every $1 million invested, oyster reef restoration creates 8.5 full-time-equivalent positions. Besides direct construction job opportunities, these reefs provide significant benefits to local commercial and recreational fishers and they enhance our regional tourism. They also provide substantial environmental benefits, providing hotspot hatcheries for fish and other marine animals, as well as water-cleaning services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kangaroo Island has been doing it tough with the bushfires and COVID-19, and I look forward to following up the reef restoration project during my trips to the island. The budget's ocean package includes nearly $40 million for new marine park partnerships. Marine parks are a critical national resource, not just for conservation purposes but also for the sustainability of fishing stocks and the sustainability of all economic activity that relies on the ocean. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As such, one marine park that my community want to see protected permanently is the Great Australian Bight. I share that desire and, from the moment I first put up my hand to be a candidate—nearly six years ago—I've joined my community to fight for the Bight and advocate for National Heritage listing for this pristine area. The Bight is an area of high conservation value. It is also an area of deep water. It is very remote and prone to big storms. It is a place where it is clearly unsafe to conduct deep-sea drilling, because of the risks of catastrophe. Independent modelling has indicated that a major oil spill could spread across our coast as far as the north coast of Tasmania out to New Zealand in the east and to Esperance in the west. There is too much to lose, whether you're a professional fisher or whether you sell fish and chips at the local store on our coastline. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Three companies have now abandoned plans to conduct deep-sea drilling in the Bight, but, unless there is protection, we always know that there's the threat of another one coming along. I just want to note that this Saturday a small group of community members have decided to organise a Hands Across the Sand event at Port Noarlunga beach for the international day of action on 15 May. They're calling for permanent protection for the Great Australian Bight. This is something our whole community really does want. Sadly, I've got a prior commitment this Saturday, but I wish them well. I wish Freya, Maddie, Janet, Sophie and Cristel all the best for this event. I want to give them my assurance that Centre Alliance will do all we can to make sure that we can have protection of the Great Australian Bight—a truly pristine wonderland. It deserves World Heritage protection. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:57</span>):  I really want to thank my good friend the member for Bass, who's a wonderful representative in this place for her electorate, for providing the opportunity to speak on what is a terribly important motion to highlight the Morrison government's commitment to our oceans and marine ecosystems and, of course, to the wonderful Great Barrier Reef. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker Wallace, Australia is home to some of the world's most unique and beautiful oceans, as you know in your wonderful electorate. And, of course, there are some really unique marine ecosystems. In my home state of Queensland, and yours, there exists the unique Great Barrier Reef, one of the world's seven natural wonders. It attracts tourists from all over the globe to witness that incredible marine environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is committed, of course, to protecting and preserving our unique oceans and marine ecosystems, which is why the Prime Minister has committed to sustainably manage 100 per cent of the ocean within our national jurisdiction by 2025—a significant milestone. Unlike those opposite, the coalition government ensured the viability of Australia's oceans and reefs by implementing the world's first ocean policy in 1998. That's an achievement of a coalition government. It is often coalition governments that lead the way in practical environmental protection, as opposed to the virtue-signalling of the Labor members opposite. We continue to provide increased funding to conserve these unique marine ecosystems. Not surprisingly, it was also the coalition government who delivered the vital landmark scheme to enhance the management of our marine parks and guarantee their economic viability. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've taken the initiative in this critical space, and remain a world leader in rainforest partnerships that protect our coastal and rainforest ecosystems. Last night's budget builds on our $67.4 million investment in our ocean and marine ecosystems. This year's budget includes an additional $100 million to protect marine ecosystems and reinforce Australia's position as a world leader in marine park management. Importantly, this funding also invests in practical environmental action to restore and account for our blue carbon ecosystems. This will improve the health of coastal environments while creating jobs and boosting regional employment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As our economy recovers from COVID-19 it is critical that we ensure that our unique oceans remain healthy and sustainable, and our government recognises the economic benefits that sustainably managed oceans and ocean environments can bring particularly to regional communities. These measures add to our commitment to the Great Barrier Reef and constitute a $1.9 billion investment to implement our Reef 2050 plan. This vital marine plan will ensure adequate federal funding to continue to improve water quality, manage crown-of-thorns starfish and reduce marine debris and pollution and will be an ambitious, world-leading reef restoration and adaption program. It's an unprecedented investment in our reef and goes above and beyond the meagre commitments made by Labor when they were last in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our planet's oceans and climate are intrinsically linked. We know this. The government is committed to investing record funding in renewable energy to reduce our emissions and build healthier oceans. Our investments will guarantee the longevity of our nation's unique oceans and marine ecosystems. Protecting our oceans means protecting our environment and our nation's economic growth by supporting existing ocean industry jobs. The Morrison government's investments will also create new jobs in unique and innovative marine and environmental sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am passionate about protecting our local unique environment in my electorate of Ryan as well, and we have many, many volunteers who do a tremendous job in doing just that. Although we don't have many ocean environments, we do of course have some wonderful creek ecosystems that contribute to our unique environment. Our creek catchment groups do wonderful work as volunteers, with the support of the federal government, to help with revegetation and to support our local flora and fauna. Since the end of 2019 I've secured over $80,000 worth of environmental grants to assist these local community groups and volunteers to continue the vital work that they do to preserve our natural area. A lot of work is done in conjunction with the Brisbane City Council, and I really want to acknowledge them and their contribution—Australia's first carbon-neutral council—and to thank local organisations in my electorate, such as the Moggill Creek Catchment Management Group, who have benefited from the federal funding and understand firsthand the fragility of local ecosystems and how to care for our unique environment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the coalition government who understands the importance of protecting Australia's oceans and ecosystems. It is our plan that continues to invest in our oceans and reefs to improve our marine ecosystems, reduce our emissions and support regional and remote communities, and we continued to do that in the budget last night. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I mean, Member for Macarthur, this motion can't be serious. This motion is congratulating the Morrison government for its management of our oceans and waterways! Well, they've done the exact opposite. Their record speaks for itself. Australia, under the previous Labor government, had the largest network of marine reserves in the world. Then, what did the Turnbull government do? They cut it in half. This government took the world's largest network of marine reserves—which are specifically dedicated to protecting the marine environment, to nurturing it to ensure that it grows—and what did they do? They cut it in half. How can you say you're protecting the marine network and our oceans when you cut marine reserves and conservation areas in half?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only did they do that; they then gave supertrawlers access to the Coral Sea to fish as much as they want—in one of the most fragile and delicate marine environments on our coastline. They cut back the marine reserve and then they said to the supertrawlers, 'Off you go.' And you know what those supertrawlers do: they suck up everything. They don't discriminate. They just chuck their nets out and haul everything in. And you guys think you're protecting our marine network! It's an absolute joke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then of course we've got the much-vaunted 2019 election promise to tackle plastic pollution in our oceans. Well, didn't that go well! We've seen an explosion in the amount of plastic off the coastline and in our rivers in Australia, and nothing came of the 2019 election promise. Then, of course, we had the famous—the infamous—Great Barrier Reef $400 million funding given to an organisation that didn't even ask for it and, when they got the money, didn't know what to do with it. And you guys say that you're better at protecting our marine reserves! Oh my God!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it gets better, because now we have this thing called PEP 11, petroleum export permit 11, an idea which this government is actually entertaining. PEP 11 will grant, believe it or not, oil and gas rigs off the coast of New South Wales, from Sydney all the way up to Nelson Bay. In some of our most precious marine environments, which literally tens of thousands of jobs in New South Wales rely on for tourism, for fishing and for hospitality, this government is entertaining allowing a company, a multinational company, to drill for oil and gas—five kilometres off the coast. And the government say that they are better at marine and ocean conservation! Even the New South Wales deputy premier, John Barilaro, has said this is a crazy idea. But do you think that the minister for resources has rejected it? Of course not. He's actually entertaining the idea. All the coastal communities up and down that area are opposed to it, and Labor has joined those coastal communities in calling on the minister to reject this ridiculous proposal, but this minister is still entertaining it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate that I represent, Botany Bay is one of the most precious marine environments on the coast of New South Wales, and we all know how historically important Botany Bay is to Australia. But the New South Wales Liberal government is actively proposing to build a massive cruise ship terminal on the last remaining plot of beach on the northern side of Botany Bay. On the north side of Botany Bay, you've got Sydney Airport, you've got the port, you've got the oil refinery processors, you've got the breakwall and then there's a little bit of beach that's left, called Yarra Bay, and guess what the New South Wales government want to do? They want to build a cruise ship terminal there—'Bugger that! We'll get rid of the rest of the sand and ocean there and we'll build a cruise ship terminal.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's actually a protected area for seagrass. The seagrass along Botany Bay was destroyed in the last dredging event, to build the third runway and expand the port. It has just started to come back. The University of New South Wales has had this seagrass sanctuary built; it has just started to come back. What do you reckon building a cruise ship terminal and dredging the bay would do to that? The weedy sea dragon and the pygmy pipehorse, which are protected species—and their sanctuaries—will be gone, not to mention the whales, the turtles, the fairy penguins and the seal colonies that exist around that area. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And they say that they are better on ocean conservation! It is an absolute joke when you look at their record—cutting back marine reserves, Great Barrier Reef management, PEP 11 and a cruise ship terminal at Yarra Bay. This motion is nothing more than a joke.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a motion that is very close to my heart. I am very pleased to see the member for Flynn in here today to speak on the motion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest data released by the Department of Health painted a pretty harrowing story about the state of health care in this country. I want to make it clear that the data has been updated since I originally tabled this motion, and it paints a very poor picture. In layman's terms, health care is becoming increasingly unobtainable for many in our society. That's reflected in the health statistics, showing huge differences in morbidity and mortality between the inner-city metropolitan, outer metropolitan and rural and regional areas. I've spoken on numerous occasions about the great divide increasing across Australian society in terms of health care, and also about how the disadvantaged and those who reside in the regions face barriers that do not exist for those who are privileged or who reside in the inner cities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is very close to my heart because as a medical student I saw the Whitlam government introduce Medibank because of the huge inequities that had developed in health care in Australia at that time. This, of course, was destroyed by the Fraser Liberal government. I then saw the Hawke government introduce Medicare to the great benefit of Australian society in terms of providing equitable health care across Australia. In fact, I started my private practice in the same week that Medicare was established in this country. Medicare was founded on a very simple notion: all Australians, no matter their background, would be afforded access to quality health care. Now, unfortunately, its universality is at risk. The fact that the coalition have allowed the cost of health care to soar for Australians is a terrible indictment on their ability to govern in the interests of all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A simple truth is that healthcare costs are expanding rapidly and the coalition government, in their eight years in power, have watched this happen, sitting on their hands. Those opposite have been in power for eight years and in that time they have demonstrated they either do not have the capacity to address the rising costs of health care or, worse, are content with watching health care become more expensive, more discriminatory and more inequitable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've provided the House, by way of this motion, with information relating to the rising out-of-pocket expenses that Australians are made to pay when accessing health care. It's on the rise, and the government is doing nothing. The government's own data demonstrates that hospital out-of-pocket costs for patients accessing general practitioners have increased by almost 30 per cent and that those accessing non-referred GP visits is now over $35. If you're a struggling single parent and you have two or three children who fall ill at the same time, as often happens in winter, the bill is enough to force people to stop accessing care. They're not unique to GP visits. Specialist consultations are rapidly becoming out of reach for many Australians. There has been the collapse of the hospital outpatient services in many areas, particularly in outer metropolitan areas, and out-of-pocket costs of specialist care have increased by more than 40 per cent. The average gap cost is around $84 to access a specialist in New South Wales, and that's even more in some specialties, such as ophthalmology, ENT surgery and orthopaedic surgery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cardiology consults with a private practitioner frequently now cost people well over $150 in out-of-pocket expenses. Patients in New South Wales are paying $27 more than they were each and every time they visit a specialist. Anaesthetics have become expensive, with the costs increasing by over 40 per cent and in some states, like New South Wales, by over 50 per cent. For anyone undergoing a procedure, such as cataract removal and intraocular lens replacement, the out-of-pocket costs are now over $1,000. Otherwise you go on a public hospital waiting list and you may have to wait up to two years to get treatment for your visual impairment. Things are only getting worse as we watch, and it's down to this government's lack of interest and lack of want to try and improve access for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since those opposite came into power, out-of-pocket costs for patients with cancer accessing radiotherapy and therapeutic nuclear medicine have increased by 190 per cent— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I can see a farrago of members from around the country and a battle of Titans between a physician and gastroenterologist, so it will be interesting to see where it lands. As a humble ophthalmologist, I do want to make a few observations, having worked in the profession in the late nineties and subsequently as a bulk-billing ophthalmologist prior to coming to this place. Out-of-pocket costs were a massive issue then. I confess to not having looked at this issue for around five or 10 years. I recall it as being around 15 per cent of total costs of being out-of-pocket for Australian health consumers. That was about third in the world, after a couple of European countries. I thought I'd better update that, with this motion before the House, and it is, in fact, 18 now. It's a longstanding and intractable problem for health systems around the world, particularly high-quality ones like Australia that allow a private sector. We often forget the additional dimensionality in health care, which is how quickly you get the care. Something Australia is extremely proud of is the speed of access to care, which is better than many countries that can claim lower out-of-pocket costs. A great example of that is the UK, where I'm sure many of us have worked. You simply sit in a queue and wait in the NHS system for months, but you don't pay. Let's remember that out of pockets is a single-dimensional analysis of this problem. We also want highest quality care and timely care, because that's all wrapped up in survival rates, of which Australia is rivalled by many other countries at the highest end. The Netherlands is probably regarded by consumers as the best in the world at the moment. But the point I wanted to make today is that this is not an insignificant issue. I commend the member for bringing it before us.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australians, $1,200 a year on average is a lot to be paying. I do want to point out that there's a big spread in those numbers. There's a significant skew towards those that are privately insured, but that doesn't mean it's not a massive issue for low-income people who want to get one consultation and are asked for hundreds of dollars or one MRI and have to find $100. That is extremely difficult for them, and it's a tragedy for me as a member of the profession to say that they don't know how to navigate their way through and know the right questions to ask a GP. Asking whether there's a slightly cheaper option is something Australians never do with the doctor because they feel they shouldn't bring money into it. The great sadness for me is that some of my colleagues don't do the right thing in finding the most appropriate and cost-effective way to get through some of these issues. They're lumped onto drugs that are way too expensive when there is a cheaper option. They're sent off to just one specialist and they don't realise that, like everything, they need to shop around. But shopping around is something we just instinctively don't do for health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also touch on what I think is a very important issue, and that is that the answer to all of this is not managed care and the US model. I think we'd have agreement across the Chamber about that. The 2019 agreement signed between nib and Cigna Corporation in the US is of great concern for me, because what we may see is, instead of those out of pockets ostensibly coming down, they're simply pocketed by someone else. You may well make it cheaper for the patient, but the profits are captured by a corporation, which quite innocently and Orwellianly claims that they deliver choice, predictability, affordability and access to quality care through integrated capabilities and connected, personalised solutions that advance the whole personal health system. What are they proposing they're delivering, and what is nib up to? You'd be right as a professional and as a clinician to say, 'If you start just signing up one from my profession and saying, "Will you agree to do the nickel-and-dime cataract operation for $100? We'll send all the work to you, and everyone else is cut out of the system."' You see very quickly this great system that we have starting to break down. My greater concern than just a singular look at out of pockets is the risk that we may well think that US managed care is a solution. So to everyone listening—there are thousands out there listening—go to sendtheeaglehome.com.au. The Americans may well have turned up here in a sweetheart deal with nib, but, for anyone who had that policy, be mindful. Send the eagle home—we can sort this out without arrangements with US managed care companies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last observation I'll make—and I hope you'll forgive a slightly political and partisan one—is about those who were here under the former Labor government, the member for Gellibrand formerly being the health minister. I just need you to know: if you're talking about an intractable problem like this, you can only look at the period that the Labor government were in power to see what their solutions were to the problem. There have been considered and concerted attacks on private health rebates, which does obviously and self-evidently raise out of pockets. But more importantly was the idea of Nicola Roxon to press the button and say, 'Let's just halve cataract rebates.' We had the grandma campaign, where we saw the incredible second-round effects of halving a rebate. This was saved by a rear-guard action by the ophthalmologists. Labor's solution at the time to fix the problem was to halve the rebate. I'll tell you what: you might have assumed it was superficially seductive, but in the end all you did was throw out of pockets through the roof. So Labor's record of finding solutions to this problem isn't good. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:18</span>):  I rise in support of this motion, and I thank the member for Macarthur for his motion highlighting these incredibly disturbing figures showing the costs of health care in Australia today. All Australians should be extremely concerned about what this means for them. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted just how important good, accessible health care is, and I want to also take this opportunity to thank all the hardworking frontline healthcare workers, the federal and state public servants and all Australians for the hard work they've done to protect us from the worst of COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that this Liberal government doesn't value universal health care in the way that Labor does. In Tony Abbott's and Joe Hockey's first budget, they decimated funding to Medicare, including higher costs for medicine and higher costs for specialists. Eight long years later what have been the results of this tired old Liberal government's work? Out-of-pocket costs have skyrocketed. If you need to see your GP, your out-of-pocket costs are up 37 per cent since Labor left government. For visits to specialists, out-of-pocket costs are up 54 per cent. For anaesthetics, out-of-pocket costs are up 51 per cent. If you're a cancer patient needing to access radiotherapy and therapeutic nuclear medicine, your costs are up by nearly 200 per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Canberrans know this reality all too well. Bulk-billing rates for GPs here in the nation's capital are among the lowest in the country, and this government is doing absolutely nothing to address it. It shouldn't cost Australians an arm and a leg just to go to the doctor, but under this government it does. Australians shouldn't be worried about not being able to pay the bills when they get sick, but under this government they are. Australians who receive the news that they have cancer should not be paying over $10,000 out of their own pockets in order to survive, yet in this country, under this government, it is something that happens. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the budget last night do to address these cost blowouts for patients? In typical Liberal fashion, not much. The government pledged $65 million to increase the rate of bulk billing in regional and rural areas. That may sound like a lot but there are 12,000 GPs in the bush, which means there is around $5,500 allocated to each GP. It doesn't even scratch the surface, and it does absolutely nothing for those of us living in cities like Canberra. In the words of the chief executive of the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association, 'This policy is hardly a game changer.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also saw an absolute slap in the face to older Australians and their health. The royal commission into aged care told the government what they needed to do to address this crisis in the sector. Not only did the government invest only a fraction of the required funds needed to fix the neglect that has happened on their watch but they're also directing the funds to the private centres that were exposed as being some of the worst in the commission's reports. They have all but left the poorly paid aged-care workers behind. They have all but ignored many of the recommendations of the commission. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a theme to how different parties treat healthcare policy in this country. Labor is the party that established Medicare and established the PBS. We will always fight for it and we always have. The Liberals are the party that tried to destroy Medicare in the 1990s and they continue to treat it with utter contempt today. I believe that, if the voters let them, they will destroy it. Australia used to be a model for how a good, efficient, equitable healthcare system can benefit its citizens. Representatives of the US Congress used to stand up in their debates and cite us as a model to aim for. Not anymore. What we've seen for the past eight years of Liberal mismanagement is the Americanisation of our healthcare system, where profits are prioritised over people, where the rich survive and the poor struggle to get the health care they need. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a Labor government will make the health and wellbeing of Australians our top priority and only a Labor government will be on your side.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  I am very glad that the member for Macarthur put up this motion on health care. It's a really good topic of discussion, and I have mixed feelings about it. Having practised for 33 years before I entered this august institution representing the good people in the Lyne electorate, I was a medical practitioner. So I declare a historical conflict of interest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Out-of-pocket medical costs are a problem for some people. Fortunately, it is of a scale that is generally very uncomfortable for some people when they visit some medical practitioners—usually in metropolitan centres more than in regional Australia, is my experience. The good news is, for most people, most of the services are bulk billed. The statistics that I have been able to obtain, for the last reporting in 2019-20—I haven't seen the 2020-21 figures yet—of the bulk-billing rate for total general practice non-referred attendances was 89.5 per cent. You can only bulk bill if you don't charge a gap; otherwise, you're not eligible to use the bulk-billing system. So that is not a bad outcome. That is much better than any other country I know that has a government and a private medical system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is, the government doesn't tell doctors what they can charge. It doesn't tell electricians what they can charge. It doesn't tell plumbers what they can charge. But I can tell you there are some plumbers and electricians that charge much greater rates to come and do electrical or plumbing work in your house than a general practitioner does for doing a house call. You've got to keep that in perspective. I'm not trying to trivialise things; I'm just trying to point out that the government doesn't control charges that professional people such as lawyers, doctors, dentists—anyone—can charge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The assistance that we give through Medicare is exemplary. With specialists, though, it is a different matter. There are some specialists who charge way more than the Medicare rate, and there is a significant gap. Whether it's in surgery or anaesthesia, in my practice some people got huge shocks when they went, and there are processes to try to limit that bill shock and the ability for the patient to have some control over who they go and see, but that involves prewarning by the GP who refers you to a specialist. That is meant to be a regular practice now, but there are some people who don't do that. People develop a relationship with a surgeon or a person who runs a referral practice, and I think any practitioner that refers should know the charges of the person they are referring their patients to. But we have put up systems to try to help people navigate that and work out what is a reasonable gap, what's industry standard and what's right out of the ballpark. There is also the extended Medicare safety net.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the first thing, we as the coalition government set up in 2019 a web site called the Medical Costs Finder. When you're going to see a surgeon or a medical specialist, you can see what the average out-of-pocket costs are in that region. If someone is going to charge you $500 out of pocket but the industry standard in the de-aggregated data is $50 or $100, you can ask your GP, 'Is this really reasonable?' That's what my patients used to hate. You'd refer them and then they'd get a bill from, say, an anaesthetist, and it was bigger than the surgeon, the hospital and me combined. They would fall off their seat. I would be very angry and I tried to control that by counselling my colleagues that I thought their fees were excessive, but not many doctors—</span>

With your out-of-pocket costs for out-of-hospital, if you're a concession card holder, a pensioner or someone on family tax benefit A and you qualify for it, you only have to reach $697 in cumulative out-of-pocket costs and you will get 80 per cent of that out-of-pocket cost covered. If you are not eligible for a Commonwealth concession card, that threshold is $2,184, so there is a system to help you with out-of-pocket costs, but most people don't— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Affordable, good-quality health care is one of them. Out-of-pocket payments for health care mean that many people, especially on those on low income, will not be able to access the health care they need. For those that can afford health care when they need it, it can still leave them and their finances severely impacted. High out-of-pocket costs prevent people with long-term or chronic conditions seeking health care. This includes delayed visits to GPs and not filling prescriptions, because of the cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicare is one of the nation's great public services; however, it only covers 80 per cent of the GP, pathology and imaging services if doctors don't bulk-bill. People with chronic conditions need additional services such as appliances, aids and pain relief for rehabilitation. For the people of Werriwa, out-of-pocket expenses have soared. The average out-of-pocket expense for seeing a specialist in Werriwa in 2020 was just over $100. In 2013, it was $64. That's an average rise in out-of-pocket costs for GP attendances of over $12 since 2013. Werriwa had the 13th-highest out-of-pocket costs for seeing a specialist in 2020, well above the national and state averages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is on top of unacceptable waiting times. For public patients, waiting times for significant elective surgery are a continuing problem, partly a result of specialists moving to private hospitals. Liverpool public hospital caters for the majority of residents in Werriwa. It also looks after part of surrounding electorates such as Fowler, McMahon and Hughes. It services up to 300,000 people who may need care, and people are waiting unacceptable lengths of time for that care.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But space and capacity are not the only issues. Liverpool Hospital is the largest hospital in New South Wales. What it lacks is funding and staff. Many have had to find thousands of dollars for private surgery because they need urgent care, but even on private waiting lists it can still be up to six weeks before you're seen. The public waiting list can stretch over two years. I've previously pointed out in this place understaffing issues in my local health district.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I highlighted that the Liverpool Hospital Medical Staff Council commissioned a report from WESTIR that was released in 2018. It found that the health district is significantly under-resourced compared to other districts. That's because the original base funding for the South Western Sydney Local Health District was not adequate to fulfil its needs. Another factor is the lack of alternative healthcare providers, which puts additional reliance on the public hospital system. The social and economic inequality decreases the ability of community members to weather health shocks. The report concludes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There appears to be greatly increased resident need and significantly less available resources compared with other Greater Sydney LHDs. This is particularly felt by Liverpool Hospital which functions as a quaternary service hospital for the district.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Analysis by the Macarthur Cancer Therapy Centre found that Sydney Local Health District receives $2½ thousand in funding per resident. In comparison, the South Western Sydney Local Health District, which includes Liverpool Hospital, only receives $1,750 per resident. The difference is 40 per cent. The evidence is clear: Liverpool Hospital does not have equitable access to funds and has a greater than average challenge in its efforts to meet health care in our community. As the state member for Liverpool, Paul Lynch, puts it, it's like building a new road and not letting cars drive on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Out-of-pocket costs and waiting times are significantly diminishing Australians' quality of care and most definitely their quality of life in my electorate. We must avoid the Americanisation of our healthcare system. It should not be determined by the suburb you live in or the limit of your credit card. As a child, I clearly remember conversations between my parents about who they could afford to take to the doctor. Medibank and then Medicare changed those conversations for my family and all other families in Australia. This government must do more to address the rising expenses of out-of-pocket health care and the inequity of access to high-level health care in Australia. I thank the member for Macarthur for moving the motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:33</span>):  Deputy Speaker Irons, I notice your raised eyebrows. That may be because you have observed that I'm not actually a government speaker, who would normally take this slot in this debate. I have risen to my feet to make a contribution because it is a critically important issue. I commend my colleague for putting this before the chamber for debate. I campaigned with Dr Freelander when he was first elected, and I can tell you there was hardly anybody who came up who didn't know him, because of his amazing contribution in his previous life to the medical field and particularly young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He has moved in this debate a motion on the issue of out-of-pocket healthcare costs. I acknowledge the two government speakers who did make contributions, by and large agreeing with the member's comments—not completely, but by and large. There are two extra speaking spots for government members to talk about what must be a critical issue in their electorates around the out-of-pocket costs of health care, and they can't even fill the speaking list. I think that's a pretty sad state of affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've just been through the COVID pandemic. An issue that's been raised by medical people across the board over that period of time is their concern about people not following up on their own existing or emerging health issues—cancer tests and so forth—at the same rate as prior to the pandemic. I don't know whether it was because people felt that the medical system was under pressure with COVID or just because they weren't remembering that regular health checks and tests need to be done. There was concern among those medical people that fewer people were accessing those sorts of medical and health services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things we know with health is that, if you put any form of barrier in people's way, too often they don't follow up. And I think the point my colleague has made about costs being one of those barriers is really important. Increasingly, health providers, GP clinics and so forth, are providing a holistic range of services. They have clinics with other specialists, chronic health management, dietary advisers, exercise people and so forth. With modern medicine, if you make a diagnosis, you can make suggestions to the patient about different things they should follow up and do. If you can walk them straight from your door to the next door, they are far more likely to follow through with those things. It's the same with making a referral to a specialist: it's a challenge to make sure people actually follow through. I have been guilty a few times myself. My GP has told me to go and have some tests, and I keep thinking I'll get around to doing that. So it is really important that you put fewer barriers in place and make it easier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Out-of-pocket costs are a big part of that story. All members have people in their electorates who contact them and say: 'The doctor said to go for this particular scan. When I went to book it they said it was going to cost several hundred dollars. I just don't have that money.' This is a serious problem. It is saving you pennies and costing you pounds. When people don't follow through and get early diagnosis and then get into early effective treatment, on a pure economic measure, we are paying more because they end up with more complex and more difficult illnesses that have to be managed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Out-of-pocket expenses have been increasing. This is a real issue and it should be a priority. I acknowledge that, in the budget last night, the government provided some additional funding for bulk-billing for regional and rural doctors' services. That indicates to me that the government is fully aware of why this is important. I would suggest that they need to look far more broadly. I would commend to them the policy on cancer support that Labor took to the last election—the policy to have no out-of-pocket costs for tests and treatment around that. I commend my colleague Dr Freelander. I am very disappointed that colleagues on the other side of the House haven't been able to fill the speakers list.</span>

                  <a href="248353" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>): I rise to speak on this important motion moved by my friend and colleague Dr Freelander. As others have done, I express my sincere gratitude to Dr Freelander for the work he has done across his working life in paediatrics, in his regional community and in his contributions to this House. This motion is important because, under this government, far too many Australians, including many in my electorate on the Central Coast of New South Wales, can't get health care when they need it. Every Australian deserves quality health care—wherever they are born, live or grow old. That's why the Whitlam government introduced Medibank, which, after being wound back by the Liberals, was re-established as Medicare under Prime Minister Hawke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Morrison government, universal health care, the foundation that underpins Medicare, is being eroded. Access to care is increasingly being determined by where you live and what you earn. The government's own Institute of Health and Welfare has found that people who earn less, live in insecure housing or get by with insecure work have difficulty accessing care, and that people living outside of big cities often have poorer health, made worse by longer waiting times, higher out-of-pocket costs and a shortage of healthcare workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Dr Freelander and my colleagues have said, out-of-pocket costs have soared in the eight long years the coalition has been in office. The average out-of-pocket cost to visit a GP has increased by 29.6 per cent, while the out-of-pocket cost to visit a specialist has almost doubled, and costs for cancer patients needing radiotherapy have nearly tripled. At the same time, wages have stalled, so people are finding it harder to meet these costs for essential care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Out-of-pocket costs are not the only barrier to care. In March, I raised the acute shortage of general practitioners on the Central Coast in the House. The community and local GPs have described this shortage as a crisis. I wrote to Minister Hunt about the impact of large parts of the Central Coast not being classified as distribution priority areas. The reply from the minister's office stated, 'Major capital cities and metropolitan areas have high levels of primary care services compared to regional and remote locations.' If the government know this, why aren't they doing something about it? The reply went on to say, 'Lake Haven and surrounding areas of the northern Central Coast are non-DPA because they have been assessed as receiving adequate GP services for the needs of the community.' So why did a senior GP with a large multisite practice tell me only last week that they turn away 200 patients a day between their four clinics because they can't meet the demand? Just last week, another practice in my electorate, in Wyong, was forced to close its books following the retirement of a GP. They sent a message to their patients: 'Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond our control, our GPs within our practice have no capacity to take additional patients. Therefore, we are unable to offer you ongoing care.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shortage means some local GPs are working 10-hour days in their practices, only to follow up with shifts at the Bridges After Hours GP Clinic on the grounds of Wyong hospital. If the Bridges After Hours GP Clinic is overwhelmed—and I'm told that sometimes they have to close their doors to patients at eight because they won't be able to see them by the time they finish, after 10—patients end up in the emergency department of Wyong hospital, sometimes waiting for up to 12 hours. I worked at Wyong hospital as a senior pharmacist in mental health for almost 10 years. Staff at the hospital are dedicated, hardworking and capable, but they are under enormous strain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given this crisis, I invited the shadow minister for health, Mark Butler, to the Central Coast last week to hear from local GPs in a roundtable. This week, we've again written to Minister Hunt urging him to act. I understand from my correspondence with the minister that the next DPA update is scheduled for 1 July this year and, if circumstances in communities change substantially, this will be reflected in the update. I call on the minister again: they must be changed. I call on the minister to act now to make the Central Coast and other regional communities like ours a priority area so everyone can get the care they deserve when they need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that if people delay care—I know this as a pharmacist and as a local MP—they get worse. They end up in emergency departments, overwhelming our hospital system. It's not in their interests, it's not in the interests of our healthcare system and it's not in the interests of our economy. I call on the health minister to act now, to act in the interests of our community and to make the Central Coast an area of priority. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's a comprehensive plan to invest in the technologies that we need to bring down emissions, create jobs and produce affordable and reliable power. This plan will accelerate the development and export of technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Australia's Technology Investment Roadmap is expected to guide $20 billion of government investment over the next 10 years and at least $80 billion of total new investment in low-emissions technology in Australia by 2030.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan will support 160,000 jobs by 2030 and avoid approximately 250 million tonnes of emissions by 2040. The road map is part of the Morrison government's plan to reduce emissions through developing new technologies rather than by imposing new taxes on hardworking Australian families and businesses. Our plan will secure Australia's energy future by guaranteeing the delivery of affordable, reliable power whilst ensuring that Australia maintains its position as a world-leading exporter of food, fibre, minerals and energy. At the heart of the road map is a vision that Australia will become a globally recognised leader in low-emissions technology through public and private sector investment in the development and commercialisation of new and emerging technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This framework sets out five priority technologies that Australia has competitive advantage in producing, including hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, soil carbon measurement, low-carbon materials production and low-duration energy storage. For each of these technologies the road map sets out measurable goals, such as aiming to produce hydrogen for under $2 per kilogram and carbon capture and storage at under $20 per tonne of carbon dioxide. This will allow the Commonwealth and the private sector to track Australia's progress in developing economically viable low-emissions technologies. Progress will also be reported annually in the low-emissions technology statement tabled in the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister has said, we're not going to tax our way into the new energy economy. Instead, we're going to make smart investments that will power Australia into the future. At the same time, the road map will create thousands of new jobs and help protect and support existing jobs, especially in the manufacturing industry, allowing them to prosper in the years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government believe that Australia has the capacity to create the energy technologies of tomorrow, and we recognise that there are already many great local businesses and researchers who are leading the way. They're great businesses like Star Scientific, a fantastic business located in Berkeley Vale, in my region on the Central Coast of New South Wales. Star Scientific is a hydrogen research and development company dedicated to creating safe, reliable, affordable energy with zero emissions. The company's key project is a breakthrough technology that enables the conversion of hydrogen into heat without combustion. It's called the Hydrogen Energy Release Optimiser, or HERO, which has been patented globally. It addresses the unique challenge of deploying hydrogen for larger-scale industrial purposes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last month I had the pleasure of visiting Star Scientific, alongside the Prime Minister and the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, to announce an investment of $539 million in new clean hydrogen carbon capture, use and storage projects. It was wonderful to be able to meet, among the many staff we met at Star Scientific that day, two local people, one from the Central Coast and one based in Newcastle, whose names are on that patent. This package that was announced at that visit—$539 million in new clean hydrogen carbon capture, use and storage projects—includes over $270 million to accelerate the development of four additional clean hydrogen hubs in regional Australia, bringing together hydrogen technology developers, producers and suppliers to collaborate and innovate. Andrew Horvath, the group chairman of Star Scientific, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… I really back the Prime Minister and the Minister when they say this is technology driven. Hydrogen is now, hydrogen will be the future fuel. It's inexhaustible, it will dramatically drop in price and it will become the base fuel of the planet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of a government that is working in partnership with the private sector to develop these new technologies, and it's great to see that local businesses on the Central Coast are a great example of an emerging industry right at the forefront.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Technology Investment Roadmap also sets out our technology-first approach to meet and beat our emissions reduction targets. The Morrison government have a proud record in this area, including by beating our 2020 Kyoto targets, and we're on track to meet and beat our 2030 targets. Between 2005 and 2018 we reduced emissions faster than many similar export oriented economies, including Canada, New Zealand, Japan and the United States. The latest data has Australia's total emissions at 19 per cent below 2005 levels. This road map will only accelerate the Morrison government's efforts to reduce emissions, while fostering innovation and economic growth. I commend the Technology Investment Roadmap and this motion to the chamber.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  I thank the member for Robertson for raising this important topic. The Technology Investment Roadmap is the government's centrepiece climate policy. We've all heard the slogans—'Technology, not taxes'. There is, in fact, nothing else presented by the government. The policy provides a process to set and achieve, theoretically, technology goals like making hydrogen under $2 per kilo. Progress is measured via low-emissions-technology statements, and the advice on the road map is provided by a ministerial reference panel appointed by the minister and headed by the Chief Scientist, with business leaders and bankers also appointed. In sum, although it's welcome as a method to assess technology readiness, it is wrong to say that this is an emissions reduction plan or an entire way of addressing climate change policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Technology Investment Roadmap in and of itself is not enough, and it is not a comprehensive climate action plan. It lacks accountability and transparency measures and relies on dodgy assumptions. The road map lacks sufficient funding to drive technologies to even have a hope of achieving its stated purpose. To drive technologies down the cost curve and to achieve meaningful emission reductions, it would have been a centrepiece of the budget last night. In the road map, the government aims to promote technology diffusion through leveraging public investment via the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Regulator. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is hoping to get to net zero using taxpayer money but offered just 0.8 per cent of total budget spend to the environment and climate. Short of the level of spending our trading partners contribute to green initiatives, in their recovery stimulus, in their budgets—for example, the EU target 30 per cent of their spending on green initiatives in their budget and recovery fund—it is a stark contrast. If the government is serious and genuine, it will dramatically increase its spending and focus on clean technologies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have to be very clear that the government is picking winners by throwing money at technologies like carbon capture and storage, and blue hydrogen. Let's be clear: carbon capture and storage is like throwing good money after bad. This is an expensive technology that has not delivered results. This is not going to achieve the goals or get us anywhere near net zero. Blue hydrogen is hydrogen made from gas. Again, this is not going to be adequate or accepted by international markets. They want green hydrogen. The only hydrogen that will be economic and clean is if it is made using renewables. To quote former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, 'The only responsible hydrogen is green, and the only use of CCS is limited.' The bulk of public investment and public money should be to deploy technologies via price signals and mechanisms. That way, the market can choose the most efficient path forward so the technologies can work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to look at the modelling that is used in this centrepiece of policy, because it does fall apart under scrutiny. There are grand claims, in relation to jobs and how many millions of tonnes of emissions will be achieved, but there is no detail. The road map does not outline any detail of where the jobs will come from or how they will be created, nor which policies are responsible for what emissions reductions. It does not articulate policy proposals, strategies, modelling or anything that would lend credibility to the claim. There is no discussion of international approaches. There are no case studies. It is simply picking certain technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, we know from the inquiry into the climate change bills that the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources has not been asked by the government to model a pathway to net zero. It begs the question: if you haven't done it by now or asked the department to do it by now, what are you waiting for? It doesn't fill you with confidence that the only policy we have under the government is a policy that may deliver—at the moment, we're on target for a 22 per cent reduction by 2030, and there is a hope that a technology road map will deliver us a potential seven per cent to possibly get to 29 per cent. This is in a situation where our trading partners more than double our ambition for emissions reduction by 2030.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be really clear: we need a lot more accountability, a lot more transparency and a lot more commitment to reducing emissions to have any hope of getting to net zero as soon as possible, as the Prime Minister repeatedly says. The technology road map is a piece of the puzzle, but it is a long way from the whole puzzle that we need.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:56</span>):  I rise in this chamber to support the member for Robertson on her motion to recognise that Australia's Technology Investment Roadmap is the comprehensive investment plan we need to bring emissions down through technology and innovation. As a scientist, I know that you have to have a diversified approach to risk when it comes to new scientific development. We can see that with the COVID vaccine. You can't actually be sure what the outcome is going to be, so you have to have a diversified risk assessment when you're going for new technology, and that is what our low-emissions technology strategy is doing. It's using government to invest in new technology and innovation, which then, once it gets to a commercialisable outcome, unleashes the free market, which will help us to get to where we need with regard to our net zero future. The Technology Investment Roadmap is the country's first concrete plan—the first concrete plan in the history of this country—for getting emissions down with technology. It's practical; it's not pie in the sky. It has goals and solutions that embrace new technologies and it's about partnering with the Australian people to make sure they know what we're doing. It is an investment that is going to have outcomes that benefit not just jobs and our economy but the planet. It is clear that we are now quietly in the midst of an exciting major energy transition to a net zero carbon future. Business knows this, and Australians demand it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's Technology Investment Roadmap is a plan to create jobs, cut energy costs, and reduce emissions. Affordable, reliable low-emissions energy will be critical to re-establishing a strong economy and supporting jobs as Australia bounces back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The road map is expected to guide $20 billion of government investment in the next 10 years and drive a further $80 billion of investment in low-emissions technology. This is the way that business works. It needs a kickstart. It needs investment, and then basically that unleashes capability. This investment will accelerate technologies such as hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, soil carbon measurement, low-carbon materials such as steel, and long-duration energy storage as well as potentially support 130,000 jobs by 2030 and avoid 250 million tonnes of emissions by 2040.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our technology-over-taxes approach is already delivering results. We're reducing emissions without imposing new costs on households, businesses, or the economy. This road map will continue to help unleash the free market and allow sustainable technologies to compete with the mature resources sector. This is about the plan to transition sensibly and practically to the new energy order that we are seeing right around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently visited the G-Store in my electorate. They have been working every day for the last 17 years to deliver renewable energy solutions to the Australian market. I was very delighted to see this innovative business, which is now stepping up with new technologies coming on board to deliver solar panels, heat pumps and batteries in a commercial way to the people of Higgins. I was delighted that, after 17 years, it was time for them to update their store. I was happy to cut the ribbon on their new, updated store. I congratulate G-Store for the wonderful work they are doing in delivering solutions that are helping to bring emissions down right here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hydrogen is a priority low-emissions technology, and the Morrison government is now backing the sector through almost $1 billion in direct investment. We know that hydrogen—firstly blue, followed by green—is going to be the way of the future, and Australia is in a wonderful position to invest in the future of green hydrogen. With our solar and our wind, we can literally bottle these renewables as green hydrogen and 'ship sunshine', as the former chief scientist Professor Alan Finkel said, to the rest of the world. We know Japan is already working towards a hydrogen led future and other countries in the Asia-Pacific are looking with interest at the memorandum of understanding we have with Japan. Furthermore, we know that countries like Germany in Europe are looking towards hydrogen for their future. There is a market that is emerging, and Australia is getting in at the ground level with important new technologies like hydrogen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It takes time to transition these technologies, it takes investments and it takes partnerships with commercial outcomes in order to do that. We are now at the point that hydrogen could become a competitive energy source for industry, power and heat generation. These new budget investments will help us reach this goal. Australia is positioning for a new energy order and is getting in at the ground level.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  I welcome the chance to talk on this very important topic. Last month I was pleased to have the chance to visit Leeson Group in my electorate. Leeson run a thriving business advancing solar technology and solar farms. Their vision is for Australians to have an abundance of financially accessible energy as we transcend into a future that is no longer harming our planet. It's wonderful to see this innovation and new technology being driven locally within Jagajaga. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's be honest: this work is happening despite this government and not because of it and its policy settings. The so-called technology road map is a road to nowhere. There's no destination because there's no target. Australia is now the only developed country to not have committed to reaching net zero by 2050, all because the Prime Minister can't convince his own backbench to set ideology aside and focus on the jobs of the future. There are some recent clear examples of this. Just last week, the resources minister vetoed public funding for a wind farm and battery project in Northern Queensland, because, apparently, the technology road map does not involve supporting renewable energy and the much-needed jobs that come with it. The proponents of this particular project say it will create 247 construction jobs and five ongoing positions. But the minister says support for the project would be inconsistent with the objectives and policies of the Commonwealth government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, Deloitte estimates more than 250,000 Australian jobs can be created as we transition to a clean energy economy. These are the jobs that the government is actively blocking with decisions like the one I've just mentioned. They are the job opportunities that will potentially pass Australia by because this government does not have a genuine plan and a target to support them. Last night's budget was another massive missed opportunity from this government: nothing new on renewables, nothing new on electricity storage, no mention of electric vehicles, nothing for the urgent grid upgrades we need to take advantage of renewables in our system, and no commitment to net zero by 2050. This is a government driven by dangerous ideology, and we are all suffering because of it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor gets it. We know that Australia can be a renewable energy superpower. Our $15 billion national reconstruction fund will allow us to partner with private capital to promote manufacturing and strategic industries, with low-emissions technologies and renewables manufacturing highlighted as a key priority for that investment. What a clear contrast from what we see from this government. They're blocking; we're seeking to invest in these new technologies. We're seeking to create the jobs we need as we come out of this pandemic, while also investing in a clean energy future for all of us. There is our rewiring the nation policy, transforming our ageing electricity grid, so we can get renewable energy to where it is needed and, once again, create jobs—create the jobs that will be there in the future; our $200 million investment in 400 community batteries so that more people across Australia can benefit from solar; and our tax cuts that will make electric vehicles cheaper, along with the commitment to develop Australia's first electric vehicle strategy. We have seen nothing of this scale from the other side—no mention in the budget. Just a technology road map that takes us nowhere. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have conversation after conversation in my electorate with people who feel almost despondent about where we are nationally on climate change. They feel like we are caught in an endless cycle where this government, driven by ideology and by wanting to have a culture war over how we address climate change, refuses to take the steps that are necessary. I tell them it is difficult. It is really difficult that the Morrison government are not taking the action that we need and are not committing to a net zero target by 2050. One of the things that concern me and that I know concern them most about that is that we are falling further and further behind the rest of the developed world. Our trading partners have these commitments, and they will start penalising us for not having them as well. So for this government to pretend that—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  The Toowoomba region is a poster child of this government's technology-not-taxes approach to driving Australia's energy future. In my electorate we're reaping the rewards of entrepreneurial companies, guided by the best research and newest technologies, investing in power sources across the spectrum—from gas to solar, blue hydrogen and even green hydrogen. We take an energy-agnostic view on the Darling Downs. As a government, we trust Australians. We trust their choices when it comes to energy provision. We know that the future energy landscape must be driven and created by market forces. It will be in the private sector, seeking efficiencies in power usage and water consumption, that reductions in our carbon emissions will be secured. We are willing to invest in what works. Of course, this next chapter in our resource sector story is built off the back of the skills and knowledge from traditional projects like the New Acland Coal Mine, which I still hold out hope will be part of our energy mix going forward. All we're waiting for is the Queensland government to give us the go-ahead for stage 3.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What might be interesting for those who haven't travelled up to the range are the types of companies who are leading the way in developing technology that will reduce emissions going into the future. Take, for example, Mort &amp; Co. This company started 24 years ago as a small, family owned livestock agency before moving into the feedlot game on the Darling Downs. They've grown into a global exporter, with more than 99,000 head of cattle across two sites. At one point, you could stand at the Grassdale Feedlot and see them all in the fantastic facilities they have available. They're also adding value to their business by expanding into fertiliser, and this Australian-first system will be operational in July this year, creating extra jobs. The fertiliser will improve the quality of the soil, will offset a large waste component of the business and will, most crucially, add to our ability to increase our carbon capture capacity not just locally but around the state. Mort &amp; Co of their own accord are also formulating a policy to report against their emissions, undertaking a baseline emissions study to inform their sustainability goals in a data driven way. They were encouraged to take this approach, because this government has decided to lead industry with a carrot and not a stick.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Toowoomba region's uptake of new technologies is also enticing companies from outside of Queensland and even Australia to look to set up shop here. Recently I was able to attend a field day near Norwin on the edge of my electorate to see an innovative Israeli irrigation technology in action. The N-Drip micro-irrigation system was being tested on a cotton crop planted on a well-established property, and the early results are quite promising. This year, despite there being heavy rainfall, we were seeing somewhere around a 35 per cent reduction in water consumption for the crop with the N-Drip as opposed to a traditional crop. We expect that number to rise to around 55 per cent in dry times. There were a lot of very interested local farmers who came out to see the concept, saw the benefits themselves and are very interested in implementing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The technology reduces consumption of that precious resource water. Most importantly, it's a low-pressure system, so it considerably reduces the amount of power used to irrigate. N-Drip's confidence in our technology-not-taxes approach has also led them to commit to starting manufacturing and recycling the tape system used in the system. I'm very hopeful that that manufacturing takes place in Toowoomba. I think it would be a great story for N-Drip to base there with us. More to come. This will create more jobs, more opportunities and more confidence amongst the local farmers who take up this solution in my local area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on. I will mention the fantastic work of FKG, who are investing in low-emissions shed horticulture and are using solar to power their impressive Pulse Data Centre site. The University of Southern Queensland has researchers, especially within the agricultural space, finding ways to translate their cutting-edge work into on-the-ground applications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going forward, I'm hopeful we can continue to grow the Toowoomba region's energy legacy, especially the opportunities arising from this government's investment in clean hydrogen. With our proximity to existing gas pipeline networks and experienced businesses already interested in stepping up, I truly believe we could offer a strong case to host a hub on the Darling Downs, a case I've already put to the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, on a recent visit to Toowoomba. He came out to the TSBE energy awards at Dalby. As the member for Groom, representing my electorate, I believe technology will drive our region's future. I'm backing businesses to rise to the challenge of emissions reduction.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  This government's approach to renewable energy, like in so many other areas of policy, is all announcement and no delivery. When I was considering the Technology Investment Roadmap, it reminded me of the Holy Roman Empire, which one historian said was neither holy, Roman nor an empire! This has little to do with technology, has little investment and has no road map. I thought to myself: what does a road map entail? What are the core elements of a road map? Firstly, a road map should have a destination. Secondly, a road map should have a route or a strategy to get to that destination. Thirdly, a road map should explain the resources necessary to get from point A to point B.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, this plan is supposed to be all about emissions reduction, but this government refuses, time and time again, to commit to zero net emissions by 2050. This government refuses to commit to a destination. How can we possibly have a road map and how can we possibly get to where we need to go if we refuse to set a destination? All of the individual policies this government talks about are limited in their own right, but they fail because there is no overarching framework; no defined destination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, there is no overarching strategy. What we have is a wish list of technology, but there is no clarity in terms of the route to get to whatever the destination might be that this government intends to get to. We have a wish list of technology but, as Llewelyn Hughes, associate professor at the Crawford School of Public Policy, said, 'The road map sets a range of targets but scrupulously avoids putting any time frame around when they should be met.' He continues:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the roadmap provides no detail on how the government decided which technologies to target. There also is no information enabling an independent assessment of the expected reduction in carbon emissions and increased economic activity—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">from the choice of different technologies. It's a road map without a destination and without a route.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as importantly, it's a road map that doesn't have enough resources to get to the destination, whatever that might be. The total package of funding provided under the government's Technology Investment Roadmap was $1.6 billion over 10 years. If there's one thing about this government it's that when they announce strategy over 10 years rather than the traditional forward estimates you know it's not about them being long-term thinkers. It's about them applying the same amount of funding they originally had in mind but putting it over a 10-year period and not a four-year period. When they announce funding over 10-year horizons it's not long-term thinking; it's about them being cheapskates. In this budget, what did we see? A further $279.9 million, again over 10 years, to provide baseline crediting mechanisms. Under $28 million per year over a decade when this government, across a range of spending, is building up over $1 trillion in debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their emphasis on emissions abatement is simply not good enough. If I look at my electorate, there are a number of industries, including manufacturing, which rely upon cheap and reliable energy—not just reliable in the short term, as in over the next weeks and months, but reliable in the long term. We need reliable sources of energy that will withstand changes in regulatory arrangements and changes in the need to abate carbon emissions. Yet what we have seen in manufacturing across this country over the last decade shows that this government is simply not doing enough to support a very energy-intensive industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Real manufacturing output has declined for the last 11 years—before the pandemic. We know that the pandemic has wrought considerable damage on this economy, but, even before the pandemic, manufacturing was in significant trouble. Last year, in fact, only 6.4 per cent of jobs came from manufacturing. That's one in 16. That is in sharp contrast to where this country used to be just a few decades ago. Australia's manufacturing sector has the lowest share across OECD nations, and it's continuing to decline under this government. This government needs to put in place a genuine energy strategy if manufacturing is to thrive. We need an energy strategy that not only provides cheaper energy but provides it within a framework that moves this economy forwards to zero net emissions by 2050, like every other major advanced economy. This road map doesn't provide a destination, it doesn't provide a route and it doesn't provide the resources to get to wherever it's trying to get to. It's not really a road map.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:26</span>):  Australia is fortunate to have a beautiful and diverse natural environment. From the sandy shores of Sydney's beaches to the desert plains of Western Australia and everything in between, this land is truly amazing. With this great fortune, though, comes great responsibility. We must protect these natural wonders from the damage of climate change and preserve them for the next generation. History will be unkind to those who ignore the impact that global greenhouse emissions are having on our environment. Climate change is not something we can ignore. The Black Summer bushfires were an awful reminder of the effect that rising global temperatures are having on our planet. No Australian can forget those fires—the tragedy of the fires, the homes destroyed, the smell of smoke as it covered our cities, and those horrific images of the country burning on our television screens each night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical we act now and utilise technology to lower our emissions and tackle the effects of climate change. This is what the Technology Investment Roadmap is doing. Australia's road map is a plan to reduce emissions while also creating jobs and cutting costs. Our technology-first approach will see Australia meet and beat our emissions reduction commitments, because in Australia we do have a good record of tackling climate change. Australia now has the highest solar capacity per person of any country in the world. We beat our 2020 Kyoto targets and we are on track to meet and beat our 2030 target, as we said we would at the last election. Between 2005 and 2018, we reduced emissions faster than many similar export-orientated economies, including Canada, New Zealand, Japan and the United States. The latest data has Australia's total emissions at 19 per cent, below 2005 levels. My constituents want action. They know this is possible without imposing taxes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our technology-not-taxes approach is already delivering results. We are reducing emissions without imposing new costs on households, businesses or the economy. The road map is expected to guide $20 billion of government investment over the next 10 years and drive at least $80 billion of total new investments in low-emissions technologies in Australia by 2030. Our plan will support 130,000 jobs by 2030 and avoid in the order of 250 million tonnes of emissions by 2040. Investing in low-emissions technology will contribute to Australia's continued success in meeting and beating our emissions reduction targets. Getting new energy technologies to parity will enable substantial reductions in global emissions in both developing and developed countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the 2021-22 budget, we are investing in the future Australian hydrogen industry, with $275.5 million for four additional clean hydrogen export hubs in regional Australia. This builds on investment for an initial hub in the 2020-21 budget. Hubs are regions where hydrogen users, producers and exporters are co-located. Hubs seek to concentrate demand for hydrogen in one geographic region, helping to reduce costs and share information. The Morrison government funding for hydrogen hubs is expected to leverage significant co-investment from the private sector, state and territory governments, and international counterparts. Hydrogen is a priority low-emissions technology, and the Morrison government is now backing the sector through almost $1 billion in direct investment. This funding will advance the goals of the Technology Investment Roadmap as we ramp up our effort to reduce emissions while supporting economic growth and lowering energy costs. We want Australia to be a world leader in the hydrogen industry. An Australian hydrogen industry could generate more than 8,000 jobs, many in regional areas, and over $11 billion a year in GDP by 2050. That's why we worked with all states and territories to release Australia's National Hydrogen Strategy in November 2019, because we know that one level of government will not solve this issue; to tackle climate change, we need a holistic approach that brings together all levels of government, industry and every Australian. We can only prevent the effects of climate change if we act together. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
