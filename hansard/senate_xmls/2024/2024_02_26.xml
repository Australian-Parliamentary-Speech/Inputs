We do, however, acknowledge the interest in the chamber in reforming the NDIS to get it back on track and ensure its sustainability for future generations. I also acknowledge the recent commitment by the Leader of the Opposition to working together with the government to this end.</span>

In producing this report, the independent NDIS review panel travelled to every state and territory, including regional and remote communities. The panel heard directly from more than 10,000 Australians, worked with disability organisations to reach out and listen to more than 1,000 people with disability and their families, recorded more than 2,000 personal stories and received almost 4,000 submissions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review delivered 26 recommendations and 139 supporting actions to respond to its terms of reference. In delivering its recommendations, the review provided exhaustive analysis and proposals to improve the operation, effectiveness and sustainability of the NDIS. The independent NDIS review panel has said that its reforms can improve the scheme and meet National Cabinet's annual growth target of no more than eight per cent growth by 1 July 2026. Discussions have continued with senators across this chamber, as well as members in the other place, to address questions about the government's NDIS reform agenda that it is pursuing together with the disability community. We look forward to working with senators in this place to get the NDIS back on track and ensure its sustainability for future generations of Australians.</span>

The Minister representing the Treasurer has already tabled key documents for the benefit of the Senate in addition to the aforementioned review.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate once again gathers to demand basic transparency from the Albanese Labor government. All we are here for is to ask the Anthony Albanese Labor government for some basic transparency and accountability when it comes to our NDIS—in short, exactly what Labor promised at the election. Let's be very clear: this Senate has for months now demanded that the government release documentations which reveal to the Australian community what the implications of their decisions in relation to the NDIS actually are. All that disabled people want to know is what these policy changes will actually mean for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be very clear: in Senate estimates last week, it was revealed that the CEO of the NDIS and the Secretary of the Department of Social Services have seen the documents that the Senate is demanding, which speak to the impact of these policy changes on people—the impact of the decisions the government has already made, because the government has already decided the targets that it has for the NDIS and that it will reduce the amount of funding provided to disabled people by tens of billions of dollars. That decision is baked into the budget that was announced last year. And all the Senate wants to know is: What does that mean for disabled people? How many disabled people does the government project will be kicked off the scheme? That is the question we've been demanding an answer to for months now. And from estimates we learned the CEO of the agency knows it and the secretary of the department knows it. The only people left in the dark are disabled people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disabled people are the ones left in the dark by this Labor government. Disabled people who put their faith and trust in this Labor government are being betrayed heinously by the decision of this Labor government to withhold from them key documentation and to withhold from journalists documents titled 'projections'. I bet you now that there are some autistic people in this country that would love to know what those projections mean and that there are some people with psychosocial disabilities that want to know what those projections mean for them, because it is those communities who this government has continually intimated are the ones that are costing too much money and whose diagnosis rate is higher than to be expected by people that don't even know how much an autism diagnosis costs and the ridiculousness of the suggestion that anyone would seek one willy-nilly when it can cost over $2,000 and you have to wait sometimes up to two years. It's absolutely ridiculous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me end on this: in all my years in this Senate, I have never quite seen anything like the attempt of the government in the last session to avoid providing key documentation about the NDIS to the Senate committee process. If the Liberal Party had tried the tricks and stunts they pulled in the last session, Labor would have howled the house down. Let me be clear: there were some questions asked by Liberal senators during that session that made me feel embarrassed to be part of it—ridiculous, nonsense stories about people having their rats cremated on the scheme that made me feel, quite frankly, ick about sharing the space with them. But, on the issue of transparency and accountability, there must be consistency. If you released figures about the scheme last year, you must release them this year. And I tell you this: we will continue to pursue these documents regardless of how uncomfortable it makes those in Labor feel, and we will retrieve them eventually in the name of every single one of the 610,000 NDIS participants who have the right to know what this government has already decided about our NDIS.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  Every time I stand up here and speak to a motion like this, I think Labor couldn't sink any further towards the bottom—and yet they manage to do so. As Senator Steele-John has so passionately and correctly articulated, not only are they refusing to provide transparency within this chamber regarding the basic documents which go to the financial sustainability of the scheme but at additional estimates we saw the absolute disgrace—with an agency that had a very large additional estimates variation—of the CEO of the NDIA, at Minister Shorten's direction no less, refusing to provide the additional estimates data for the agency. They refused. And why did they refuse? Because the figures happened to be replicated in a quarterly report which had been produced and was sitting on Minister Shorten's desk and the desk of every state and territory disability minister. But, because the agency CEO couldn't manage to go down to Minister Shorten's office and grab the information, or the information she had on her laptop, she said the information wasn't available. That was clearly a lie. It was available. So they didn't provide the data on the scheme. But guess what? The very next morning, they published the quarterly report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This lack of transparency is not just a disgrace for how Labor treats senators and, through senators, all Australians who fund the NDIS; as Senator Steele-John has said, there are over 650,000 people now on the scheme, and those with serious and permanent disability whose lives it has changed are now incredibly worried about what they are going to do with the scheme. What was this data that they were hiding at additional estimates? The number of participants as at 31 December was 646,449, which is half a per cent higher than the June 2023 projections. They were hiding the fact that the scheme continues to increase, in both participant numbers and the average cost per package, which are the two drivers of the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the minister today, Senator McAllister says, 'We've done another review, and everything is going to be fine.' That is simply not true. Understanding the problem was never the issue with this scheme. Before this two-year review, there were at least 30 reviews. The problems are well known. But there are no easy solutions to reforming the scheme so that it survives for those with serious and permanent disabilities in our nation. Admiring the problem from every which way has never been the issue—yet that's what they've done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly this is a union agenda now, and also, sadly, an agenda from the big providers. Have a look at what the review is recommending to change the legislation. They want to remove choice and control from NDIS participants. That is one of the fundamental tenets of this scheme, that people with serious and permanent disability, for the first time, have choice and control over their own lives—how they live their lives, what service providers they get. But this government now wants to destroy that fundamental tenet of this scheme. Not only do they want to do that; they also want to go back, essentially, to block funding for large providers and destroy independent contractors in the sector by making them be registered, which will of course not drive down the costs. Anybody who knows anything about economics knows that it will drive the costs of the scheme up further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish on this. The other thing we found in the third quarter report, after an hour of the most painful questioning of the NDIS actuary, is that this government has $60 billion worth of savings already booked in the budget over the next nine years. That's $60 billion worth of savings that they have ripped out of the budget. And guess what? They're spending $720 million and saying that that will realise those savings. That cannot happen, and it will not. It is the biggest fraud. Shame on you for everything you're doing to those on the scheme.</span>

How is it going to prejudice Commonwealth and state government relations? Who at a state government level is objecting or has objected to the release of this information? What is the basis of this claim? There is no substance to this claim. It's a political excuse. It's a political assertion of public interest immunity, and it's simply unacceptable that the Senate—and, through the Senate, the people of Australia, especially the people who Senator Steele-John spoke so passionately for: those Australians who are on the scheme or are seeking to go on the scheme—is denied this information. It's simply not good enough.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:16</span>):  A couple of weeks ago in estimates we had an opening statement delivered by Minister Farrell which, I have to say, was probably the most disgusting opening statement I've ever heard in any inquiry, let alone at Senate estimates. The blatant politicisation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme that's being conducted by those opposite is nothing short of appalling. I acknowledged to Senator Farrell that clearly he had not written that statement—that it had been written for him by Minister Shorten.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS has been a scheme that has had bipartisan support. We, in government, always reached out across the aisle and said: 'Help us help participants and their families on the NDIS. Let's work together to make sure this scheme is the best it can be.' Yet those opposite are now using those most vulnerable in our society to manipulate union membership and absolutely destroy the 'choice and control' principles of the NDIS. How do we know this? We know because they're now trying to push through inquiries into registered and unregistered providers. For those that don't understand and don't access the NDIS, 'unregistered providers' doesn't mean that they're not qualified. It doesn't mean that they don't have skills, experiences and qualifications. For a lot of them, it means that they're sole operators. They work for themselves. They work running their own small business, and they are not part of the old block funded routine that we know served disabled people so poorly. But what are we seeing here? We're seeing a push back to people having to use the big old block funded providers. I can assure you, as someone who uses both registered and unregistered providers, I will lead the rallies in every state, in every marginal seat and everywhere I can go, because I use an unregistered provider who charges me about a third of the rate of a big block funded provider. The unregistered provider has been with my family for well over a decade and knows my son and our family better than anyone. This is my story, but this is the story of so many people who have children with a disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What was also interesting is so much of this is couched in, 'We want to cut down on fraud.' We didn't get much out of the CEO of the National Disability Insurance Agency at estimates, but one of the things that we did get was that self-managed participants of the NDIS have the lowest level of fraud. That's because it is a direct relationship between the participant and their family and that provider. They know when that provider was with their family, because they manage the plan themselves. We know that once it goes into the bureaucracy of these big providers it's a case of, 'Oops, we accidentally billed you for a day that you didn't provide a service.' We know that the fraud is occurring within the big-scale operators, the ones who are managing plans on behalf of participants, not where participants are managing it for themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this is just about a push for the Health Services Union and pushing all NDIS service providers in what we already know is a super-thin market. One of the biggest things that we know about the NDIS is that participants struggle to find enough service providers because the market is already thin. What are those opposite doing? They want to make it even thinner. They want to spread it out so that, if you're not a part of the HSU, you can no longer work with people with a disability. Shame on you! It is absolutely appalling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To Senator Scarr's point about the claim that it's going to damage the relationships with the states, I'll give you a little bit of a tip, because some of us do talk to people across the country at all sorts of levels of government. Disability, education and health state ministers don't know what they've been signed up to. They've got their own budgets to manage, but they don't know what additional supports they're going to have to put into classrooms or into community health—into all of these areas—because it is done under secrecy and a cloak of darkness. We know that these kids and families, particularly in the early childhood strain, are going to be left even more vulnerable than from the challenges they currently face under the scheme as it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely disgraceful that we are here again. Senator Steele-John, NDIS Monday will be back, and we'll be back and back, because this is not going to be allowed to stand. This is a government that promised transparency. We know that it's a slogan only as good as the $275 off your power bill. We're never going to see transparency. We're never going to see any honesty or integrity from those opposite, just as we're never going to see $275 off our power bills.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the Australian Greens are giving the Senate the opportunity to dissent—to oppose the ongoing invasion of Gaza. This week marks a very grim milestone. Nearly 30,000 people in Palestine have perished in the bombardment and invasion at the hands of the State of Israel. Countless more are beneath the rubble of buildings that used to be at the heart of communities in the cities of Gaza City itself, Khan Younis and Rafah. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced. People have a severe lack of food and water. The last time UN agencies were able to deliver food to northern Gaza was over a month ago. The World Health Organization estimates that 90 per cent of children under the age of two are in severe food poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government must condemn the invasion of Gaza. People's access to medical aid is dwindling day by day. Much of Gaza's hospitals are now completely closed or have had operations severely limited by the siege. Such is the case in Al-Shifa, where the hospital's oxygen supply plant has been destroyed. Health staff are reported to be digging graves in the grounds of their places of work due to the large numbers of deaths that have occurred or are anticipated and the need to manage the horror of those corpses. The Australian government must condemn the invasion of Gaza. The scale of the human suffering that we are witnessing every night on TV and on social media is unimaginable. But, sadly, because of the actions of the State of Israel in the last three months, these unimaginable scenes have become everyday reality. The government has failed the people of Palestine. The pausing of funding to UNRWA by Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs has cut off vital aid access. All our government have been able to offer in this time are, at best, meaningless words without action, and, at worst, they have made the situation worse. This situation is devastating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian parliament has the opportunity, in the face of Netanyahu stating once again that he intends an all-out assault on Rafah, to condemn, in no uncertain terms, the actions of the State of Israel. The world has been warning the State of Israel against an assault on Rafah, and the State of Israel has not been listening. Meanwhile, this government continues to sell arms to the IDF and enable them to drop bombs on children, hospitals, schools and refugee camps. This government, in pausing and effectively cutting funding and aid to Palestinians, has furthered the reality that they are on the brink of death, disease and starvation. This government has refused to back an immediate ceasefire that would see the siege ended and the bombing stopped. This government has refused to support the International Criminal Court's investigation into the State of Israel's genocide in Gaza, despite rightfully supporting Ukraine's case two years ago. The government can and must do more. That is why the Greens are calling on the Senate to formally vote to condemn the unequivocal support given to the State of Israel, to remove its support for the invasion of Gaza and to condemn the actions of the State of Israel. These crimes must be condemned. Failure to do so condemns the government.</span>

We heard that in the presentation from Senator Steele-John, who perpetuates incorrect statements. We have not sold arms to Israel. We have increased funding for multiple agencies in Palestine. Don't come in here and try to whip it up, as you have done in previous sittings. How about the Senate work together on a pathway for peace and on keeping our community unified?

The government is using Australia's voice to advocate for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and humanitarian access, the release of hostages and the protection of civilians. If the Greens were really concerned about the crisis in the Middle East, they would be engaged in the discussions for a pathway to peace and keeping our community unified. They continue to reproduce the conflict here to whip up anger and fear and to perpetuate myths in the Australian community because they think there are votes in it for them. I remind the Greens that right now there are 130 hostages still being held by the terrorist group Hamas.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the humanitarian situation in Gaza already dire, the casualties from an expanded military operation would be devastating. Australia's message to Israel is to not go down this path. Our position on this is consistent with our position the whole way through this conflict, which has been that international humanitarian law must be respected and civilians must be protected. We have communicated this at a senior level. In recognising Israel's right to defend itself, we have said that the way it does so matters. Israel must respect international humanitarian law. Civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected.</span>

Many civilians who are displaced in Israeli operations in the north have moved to the south to this area, often under Israeli direction. We are not alone in expressing concern at the prospect of an expansive Israeli military operation in Rafah. The United States has said it will be a disaster and should not proceed without a credible plan for ensuring safety for the more than one million people sheltering there. Germany has said it would be a humanitarian catastrophe. Canada has said it would have a devastating impact. We have consistently said there is no place in Australia for antisemitism, Islamophobia or prejudice or hatred of any kind. We must all work together to ensure that the distress in our community does not turn into hatred.</span>

The foreign minister has made these comments at the highest level. I have made these comments last week at the foreign ministers meeting in Brazil. People are speaking out. People are concerned. What's happening is incredibly distressing. But do you think coming in here and perpetuating myths in this chamber about what the Australian government is doing is going to help one little bit? Do you seriously think so? How about you act like grown-ups and work with us on the serious matters that present in the Middle East—work together on a credible pathway to peace, which is what responsible international actors are doing, speak out against further civilian loss of life and look at ways that we can support the humanitarian efforts in the Middle East? We have increased funding, not decreased it. We are not selling arms to Israel. You should not repeat those claims in this chamber when you know that they are not true. We should all in this chamber work together on that pathway to peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  The coalition in no way supports either the attempt to suspend standing orders or the motion being put forward by the Australian Greens, which once again is a demonstration of the Australian Greens' one-sided, unbalanced attitude towards these issues and a fixation that comes from the Greens that seems to wish to elevate this conflict above all others that tragically occur around the world and, in doing so, seemingly to ignore the many other challenges and, indeed, tragic loss of life that occur around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubting the fact that there is a tragedy that has been occurring across Gaza, Palestinian territories, and Israel, elevated to new heights on 7 October. What I note is that nowhere in the motion that the Greens seek to have debated nor in the contribution made by Senator Steele-John was the word 'Hamas' mentioned once. Nowhere in the motion that the Greens seek to have debated nor in the contribution by Senator Steele-John were hostages still held by Hamas referenced once. Not once in the motion or in the contribution to the debate have the Greens even indicated any recognition of what triggered the conflict we see right now—of the horrors that occurred on 7 October. Not once were they mentioned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's bring it from 7 October to more recent times because, just a couple of weeks ago, Israel managed to rescue a couple of those hostages who have been held since 7 October by Hamas. From where did they rescue these hostages? From the Rafah region. Why is this notable? Because it's a demonstration yet again of the way in which Hamas doesn't just target, kill and brutalise Israeli citizens—Jewish peoples—but is also shameless in its use of Palestinians and residents of Gaza as human shields. Why else would hostages have been found in the Rafah region?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we all wish to see the loss of life come to an end. We all wish to see a pathway that can enable Israelis and Palestinians to live peacefully side by side. But the prerequisite to being able to live peacefully side by side is to have confidence in the security of that peace, to have confidence and certainty that it will be available so that all peoples can pursue their legitimate aspirations and ambitions in life. That is clearly not possible with Hamas. There is no role for Hamas in the future governance of Gaza or the future governance of Palestinian peoples. There can be no role for them. As I've said in this place before as we've faced these motions from the Greens, a sustainable ceasefire would be one where Hamas releases the hostages they continue to hold—releases those hostages unconditionally—and surrenders their terrorist operatives and their terrorist infrastructure. It is infrastructure has been demonstrated to be a highly sophisticated network of tunnels built throughout Gaza underneath hospitals, schools and other civilian and public infrastructure—again, a demonstration of Hamas's willingness to use the Palestinian people and Gaza residents as shields for those Hamas terrorists as they seek to wage their bloody, brutal and antisemitic war against Israel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the weeks since we last met, other things around the world have happened, too. We've just passed the second anniversary of Russia's bloody and brutal invasion of Ukraine. We've seen increasing insurgency by people in Myanmar against the military junta. But do we see the Greens seek to disrupt Senate proceedings with motions on those or any other conflicts? No, we don't, because they are fixated on this issue—because on this issue they seek to score political points rather than deal with the gravity of what is before us. We won't be a part of it. We continue to support the bipartisan motion this parliament passed following the horrors of 7 October.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  I rise to speak on the government's Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024. At the outset let me say that the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 is perhaps the high-water mark of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's breach of trust of the Australian people. It represents the culmination of a long, methodical and intentional mistruth told to the Australian people hundreds of times since before the 2022 election. It was finally brought out into the open on 25 January, when the Prime Minister and the Treasurer stepped into the Prime Minister's courtyard and announced that, despite everything that they had said over the last two years, they would be amending the third stage of the tax cuts delivered by the coalition in a previous parliament. This is the bill that finally and completely smashes any semblance of credibility that this Prime Minister had. Who will ever believe this Prime Minister when he makes them a promise again? After telling Australians, 'My word is my bond,' and insisting more than a hundred times, with his Treasurer, that there would be no more changes to the stage 3 tax cuts, the Prime Minister broke his word. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's word is clearly worthless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence that the cost-of-living committee has heard from the Treasury demonstrates that the Prime Minister's mistruths are even more egregious. While the Treasury confirmed that it had been tasked with actively examining ways to amend the stage 3 tax cuts on 11 December last year, dozens of times after that point the Prime Minister looked Australians in the eye and said, 'We are not reconsidering that position.' As far as shameless mistruths go, that one should shoot right to the top of the list, but there are plenty more to choose from. Don't forget, 'Energy bills will fall by $275,' and, 'Labor has real and lasting plans for cheaper electricity and cheaper mortgages.' But what about this one, Mr Deputy President: 'I'll say this very clearly. Australians will be better off under a Labor government'? That was Prime Minister Albanese back in April 2022 when he was opposition leader Anthony Albanese.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is, despite the words of the Prime Minister, Australians are really doing it tough, and they have been for a long time; they have been for more than 18 months. Labor's cost-of-living crisis is crushing Australians. As Chair of the Select Committee on the Cost of Living, along with my deputy, who is now sitting in the chair, I have heard regularly from witnesses right across the country and right across the spectrum about just how tough it is out there for ordinary Australians paying their mortgages or rent, paying their gas and electricity bills and paying for groceries at the supermarket, because of Labor's inability to manage the economy. Just recently, in Gladstone, we heard from a local council that younger people were being forced to choose between paying their rent or seeing a GP, because there are no longer any GPs in Gladstone that allow for bulk-billing and those young people's budgets are simply at breaking point. Time and time again—from Port Augusta to Parramatta, from Box Hill to Launceston—we have heard from families with one income, or even two incomes, who are forced to seek charitable assistance because they can't pay their mortgage or put food on the table.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that this government has mismanaged the economy and made a deliberate decision to break promises, to raise taxes and to abandon any genuine reform on personal income taxes. We have a government that is more interested in radical, productivity-sapping industrial relations than in getting productivity moving, and what is the result? Well, productivity is flat and economic growth is non-existent. Based on the most recent data, if it weren't for the massive immigration numbers, we would be in a recession. This per-capita recession that we are now in is what ordinary Australians are feeling every single day. Businesses are folding and it's becoming harder and harder to employ people. Things are not getting better under Labor; they are going backwards. At the same time, we note that the Prime Minister has hired more than 10,000 new public servants in Canberra. But Australians aren't feeling 10,000 people better served by this government. Instead, they're feeling the pinch of the cost-of-living crisis with no plan in sight and no response from this government—simply rhetoric.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister promised in January 2023 that his New Year's resolution was to address the cost of living. In January of this year, in a moment of out-of-character candour, he admitted that 'cost-of-living pressures had lasted much longer than people thought'. What a surprise! And, he said, 'the range of measures that we put in place had not been effective enough'. These are the Prime Minister's words: 'the range of measures that Labor put in place have not been effective'. Well, what on earth have they been doing for the last 18 months?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings us to the bills before us, the culmination of this deceit. The facts demonstrate that these bills are simply a political response, a PR response, a quick fix that has little relationship to the cost-of-living pressures that Australians face every day. I'd like to take this opportunity to remind the chamber of something that Minister Gallagher said about the original stage 3 tax cuts in February last year. When asked by Senator McKim which of those three points the stage 3 cuts fit under, Senator Gallagher promptly replied, 'the cost of living'. Go figure!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a deceit long in the making that found its moment under the guise of urgent cost-of-living relief. But how does that stack up? The Treasury confirmed that the changes to the Medicare levy were, in fact, provisioned in the 2023-24 MYEFO but they weren't announced. How urgent is this cost-of-living crisis if you provision for a policy, if you make a decision on a policy, but you don't announce it for a couple of months? How urgent can it be? The government was content to make a change and not announce it straightaway as Australians went through a very costly and very uncertain Christmas, because it wanted to bank that political credit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw recently that the government were advertising for PR professionals for the Treasury to be paid around $150,000 to deal with 'suppliers, including creative research and public relations agencies'. When pressed about the timing of the decision and its significance, we heard the Treasurer say it was not taken in the usual course of the budget processes. What did the Treasurer say? He said, 'We had to do this before Dunkley.' Whoops! He said the quiet bit out loud. 'We had to do this before a by-election'. How shamelessly political! Then came the real shocker. The same day that Labor announced $14 million in additional spending for food-relief agencies like Foodbank, who are doing so much of the heavy lifting right now, it was uncovered that they were also going to spend $40 million—not $14 million but $40 million—of taxpayers' money to try to spin their broken promise. They are going to create a $40 million ad campaign to sell tax cuts that you don't need to apply for—you just get them automatically. They're going to spend $40 million of your dollars telling you how lucky you are—outrageous! I know that Australians would feel much more different if that money went to Foodbank rather than marketing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will always stand for lower, simpler, fairer taxes, and that's why, in government, we delivered stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 of our personal income tax plan. Under the former coalition government, we increased the threshold for the lowest tax bracket from $37,000 to $41,000. We also abolished, in the original stage 3, the entire 37 per cent bracket and reduced the 32 per cent bracket to 30 per cent. These reforms meant that more people would pay less tax over time. In fact, anyone earning between $45,000 and $200,000 would pay no more than 30c in the dollar. Well, that has gone. That's been smashed. That would have dealt with the pernicious bracket creep facing ordinary Australians right now. It would have meant you could have gone for that promotion, you could have taken on the extra overtime hours, and you wouldn't have had to pay any more tax to do it. Well, that has been thrown out the window.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will always stand for lower, simpler and fairer taxes, and we will always stand by our principles. That's the reason we will support taking the 19 per cent bracket down to 16 per cent. But we deeply oppose Labor weaponising the politics of envy, in a cost-of-living crisis, after all the assurances in the last two years from the Prime Minister to Australians who were waiting for a tax cut—Australians who had looked at their budget, looked at the law, heard what the Prime Minister had said and made plans because they trusted their government. That trust has been broken, irrevocably. These are the Australians that the Prime Minister has let down. This is cynical politics, and it's focused on slicing and re-slicing an ever-diminishing pie, not growing the pie so that all Australians benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For this reason, the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and I are all committed to taking to the next election a tax reform package that is in keeping with the original stage 3 tax reforms, committed to fighting bracket creep and enshrining aspiration, because strong leaders keep their promises, even when it's hard to do so. Our package will deliver lower, simpler and fairer taxes. It will fight bracket creep, enshrine aspiration into our system, reward hard work and support a strong economy where every Australian has the chance to get ahead. We will unite Australians, not pit them against each other. Our package will be delivered while providing for Australia's future security and guaranteeing the essential services that all Australians rely upon. The package will be fully costed and it will be ready to implement when we are elected. More importantly, it will be delivered, because we keep our promises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's support for a tax cut should never be read as an endorsement of Labor's breach of faith. We will continue to hold this government and the Prime Minister to account for the commitments that they have made but that we know they are secretly planning to back out of. The Treasurer said as recently as this month, with regard to changes to negative gearing, 'Well, that's not something that we're proposing, not something we're considering, not something we are working up.' That sounds familiar, doesn't it? I think that's what we heard about the stage 3 tax cuts just months ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On tax settings for the family home, the Prime Minister also expects Australians to believe his denials, but he has shown just how reliable he is with the truth. These bills have been badged 'cost of living'. The coalition has been listening to Australians on the cost of living for more than 12 months, since the Senate established the Select Committee on the Cost of Living to inquire into that very issue. I can safely say that this is a government that has done nothing about it. Instead, it has been distracted on whatever is important to the government, whatever is important to Labor. It has had no plan to deal with the cost of living. It has focused on the wrong priorities—a $450 million failed referendum that anybody could have told you, months in advance, was going to fail. And yet they persisted. That was a promise they were happy to keep. But, unfortunately, the stage 3 tax cuts was one that they were happy to set aside. There has been an additional $209 billion in spending since the government came to government, while the cost-of-living committee has heard over and over again that a key way to reduce inflation is through reducing government spending, sending the right messages to the market so we don't have one foot on the brake and one foot on the accelerator—the Reserve Bank doing one thing and the government doing another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will support a tax cut. To those Australians that are struggling to put food on the table, that are struggling to rely on charity and on those breakfast programs at schools, that are asking for energy bill relief, that are going on payment plans, that are entering hardship programs with their banks, that are shutting the doors on their businesses or that are pawning their wedding rings to pay for school supplies: know that the coalition has heard you, that the coalition sees you and that the coalition is on your side. More can be done for you, and more should have been done for you. The opposition will continue to hold this government and this Prime Minister to account for the mistruths they have presented to the Australian people, and we will continue to stand for lower, simpler, fairer taxes for all Australians.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  I think it would be helpful for folk in this chamber and folk listening to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the associated bill to understand how we've come to find ourselves here today. The Morrison government, prior to the last election, brought forward a massive package of tax cuts—including stage 3, which would have seen politicians, CEOs and billionaires get a $9,000-a-year tax cut when people on the minimum wage would have received absolutely nothing. It was $9,000 a year for the CEOs and the politicians, and if you are on the minimum wage, under stage 3, as originally cast by Mr Morrison, you would have received absolutely nothing. And what happened when that legislation came into this place? The Labor Party voted for it. The Labor Party made it law. Make no mistake: if the Labor Party had joined the Greens in opposing those tax cuts, they would not have become law. So the only reason those tax cuts—which gave CEOs and politicians an extra $9,000 a year in their pockets and gave people on the minimum wage absolutely nothing, not a red cent if you are on minimum wage—became law was the Labor Party decided to vote for them. That was a stark reminder of the lack of political courage that is embodied in the modern Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we had an election, and, despite a significant erosion in its primary vote, Labor fell over the line with enough seats to form a government in the House of Representatives. Then, after repeatedly telling Australians that there were no plans to change the stage 3 tax cuts, Mr Albanese and Mr Chalmers, at the start of this year, revealed that they were planning to change the stage 3 tax cuts—and rightly so, in the view of the Greens, because those tax cuts were never a good idea and should never have been supported by the Labor Party in the first place. Having made the decision to change and recast Mr Morrison's stage 3 tax cuts, which then became Mr Albanese's stage 3 tax cuts, did Labor actually recast them to make our tax system more progressive, as you would expect the Labor Party to do? No, they did not. What they did was recast them to make them slightly less regressive than the massively regressive stage 3 tax cuts that were originally designed by people like Mr Morrison and former senator Cormann.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It beggars belief that this is where we find ourselves today. Today Labor is choosing to give people on over $200,000 a year a $4,500-a-year tax cut, and today Labor is also choosing to give people on income support absolutely nothing. This is how far the modern Labor Party has fallen. This is how far out of sight and out of mind people on income support are for the modern Labor Party. There are Australians who are literally starving because they cannot afford to eat. There are Australians who are homeless because they cannot afford to rent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what does the Labor Party do? Instead of looking after these people and raising the woefully inadequate level of income support, the Labor Party has chosen to give politicians and CEOs a $4½-thousand-a-year tax cut. That is the modern Labor Party for you, folks: $320 billion of tax cuts over the next decade, when Labor is claiming it can't afford to put dental into Medicare, that it can't afford to forgive student debt, that it can't afford to make child care more affordable and that it can't afford to raise income support. Labor can't afford to do those things because it has chosen to spend $320 billion on tax cuts, the largest of which go to the highest income earners in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You could put mental health and dental health into Medicare for a third of $320 billion. You could wipe student debt many times over. You could make child care free many times over. You could put billions of dollars into building affordable homes for people to live in—into social and public housing. You could make public transport free. You could put in fast rail between Australia's cities. You could build the renewable energy infrastructure and the storage capacity that we need in order to get to net zero by 2035. But what does the modern Labor Party decide to do? It decides to implement $320 of tax cuts, to give people on over $200,000 a year a $4½-thousand-a-year tax cut. This is an extraordinary abject surrender by the Australian Labor Party to the manoeuvrings of the Morrison government and the LNP. Folks, this is why the country is in such a mess.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me explain to you how this happens. The LNP come into government and they lurch this country to the right. They torture refugees, they demonise migrants and they give tax cuts to the wealthy. They lurch this country to the right, and Labor acquiesces to every one of these things, because they are too gutless to stand up and fight for what is right in this country. They leave that to the Greens, and we oppose these things every step of the way. Then when Labor gets into government they move us back about two per cent of the way that the Liberal Party took us, because Labor is too gutless to move this country to where it needs to go. They are too gutless to make the corporations pay their fair share of tax. They're too gutless to put a wealth tax on in this country. They are too gutless to walk away from the $370 billion of the AUKUS submarines. They are too gutless to reverse Mr Morrison's stage 3 tax cuts. And so it goes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government in this country is being swapped by a right-wing extremist party in the form of the LNP and a centre-right party in the form of the ALP. That is why this country keeps on lurching to the right. That is why Australians are literally starving on income support. That is why we have a six-figure number of Australians who are homeless, who can't afford to rent a place to live. The neoliberal brainworms have infected both major parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely critical that we take a stand here today and we make the big corporations and the superwealthy pay their fair share of tax so that we can actually help people with things that matter in their day-to-day lives—like putting dental into Medicare. Last time I looked, your mouth was part of your body. It is extraordinary that we've just had a celebration of an anniversary of Medicare by the Labor Party, and yet, rather than celebrating the anniversary of Medicare by doing something to make it stronger, all we got was the bells and whistles. They could put dental into Medicare and they should put dental into Medicare. They should also put mental health into Medicare, because last time I looked someone's mental health was critical to their overall health and wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party could do so much for so many people in Australia—and 40 or 50 years ago, it would have done those things. But it is a shadow of its former self—a shell of a political party, hollowed out by careerism and neoliberalism to become a pale imitation of the LNP. That is where we find ourselves today, and that is how we find ourselves today debating these changes to the stage 3 tax cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor could have actually used the opportunity of changing its position. That's something they should have done—and something the Greens were calling on them to do, I hasten to add. They should have used that opportunity to make our income tax system more progressive or to do some of these other things that would actually help people, including raising income support. The fact that they didn't again shows a lack of vision and a lack of political courage. The Australian Greens are the only people in this parliament who opposed Mr Morrison's tax cuts from day one. Those tax cuts were supported by many in this place, and, once the Labor Party indicated its support for them, as I said earlier, they became law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I do want to say one other thing about how we find ourselves here. The Greens kept the pressure on Labor. Millions of Australians kept the pressure on Labor. And finally Labor accepted that it needed to make some changes. When the Greens went to the election, we said, 'Give us the balance of power and we will push the next government to go further and faster on a range of things, including addressing economic inequality in this country.' And we have delivered that, repeatedly, in this term of government. We delivered it on climate. We delivered it on the stage 3 tax cuts. Make no mistake: Labor would not have shifted if it hadn't been for the campaigning of the Greens and millions of Australians who rely on us and who join us to build a movement to make this country a fairer place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That work has a long, long way to go. We need to make the big corporations pay their fair share of tax so that more Australians can lead a life of dignity and wellbeing. We need to make the superwealthy pay their fair share of tax so more Australians can live a life of dignity and wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government can never claim that it can't afford to put dental and mental health into Medicare, or make child care more affordable, or wipe student debt or raise income support, because they could have afforded to do those things if they had only chosen not to proceed with the stage 3 tax cuts. They could have recast these tax cuts to ensure that no-one earning an income of over $200,000 a year got a tax break and that, instead, more was done to help people on the minimum wage and on income support. It is an absolute travesty that Labor chose not to do any of those things and instead give a $4½ thousand a year tax cut to corporate CEOs, billionaires and politicians. That is how far the modern Labor Party has fallen.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024. But, before I talk about those two bills, there is something I have to put on the public record. I understand that Senator McKim was speaking as he did because there's a state election in Tasmania, but for the Greens to say that the Labor Party is not the party of old—I will say this on the public record. There's one thing about the Greens: they never change. That's why in Tasmania, after this state election, there will never be a deal with the Greens, because we don't want to govern and have this fantasy of utopia, which is what we get from that end of the chamber on every piece of legislation. It's all about utopia and what they would do. One thing we know for sure is that the Greens will never, ever have to balance a budget, because they will never be in government. So they can say to the people whatever they want to say. They can promise the world because they will never, ever have to deliver in government. That's the reality of the circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on that side of the chamber want to make this a really big political issue, and say: 'It's a broken promise by the Prime Minister.' Yes, he did break his promise on the third stage. He did that because of the changed circumstances in the Australian economy and because at the heart of a Labor government is always fairness. These tax cuts will actually deliver a tax cut for all working Australians, not just the top end of town. The reality is that the stage 3 tax cuts proposed by the Morrison government—by the Liberals—would have given people like us in this chamber a huge tax cut. We don't need that. But Middle Australia was being left out. Aspirational taxpayers were neglected by those opposite, who always neglect them. That's because these taxpayers don't vote for them and because they don't live in their electorates. If you go through electorate by electorate in this country, those who would have got the biggest tax cuts are all in Liberal held seats. We don't have to be Einstein to work out why they were looking after those voters, do we?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about what this means to the 84 per cent of taxpayers who will get a bigger tax cut. They actually will get more support to combat the cost of living. This plan is a better plan for our country. It's a better plan than those opposite were offering to the Australian people when they were in government. The Albanese government's plan means more tax relief for more workers to help them and their families with cost-of-living expenses. It means that electricians and plumbers living in my home city of Launceston will get a tax cut. It means nurses in St Helens on the east coast of beautiful Tasmania will get a bigger tax cut. It means people working in retail in Hobart will get a bigger tax cut. It means people in Burnie and Devonport working in hospitality and in mining will get a bigger tax cut. People working day in and day out across this country will get bigger tax cuts. This is all about supporting all Australians who are working, to help them benefit from these tax cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These tax cuts build on our broader plan to ease the cost-of-living pressures and to come up with tens of billions of dollars in relief across child care, energy bills, rent, access to free TAFE, and medications, which is already rolling out and benefiting our economy. We have cheaper medicines. We have cheaper child care. These are real benefits to everyday middle Australians. The cost-of-living tax cuts for Middle Australia mean that every taxpayer will get a tax cut from 1 July this year. The average worker will now get more than $1,500 a year. Teachers, nurses, aged-care workers, disability support workers and early childhood educators will take home more pay because of our tax plan. So will young Australians, and so will those Australians living in our regions and rural areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024 is also an important piece of legislation which will affect most Australians. This is another way that the Albanese Labor government is providing tax relief to Australians on modest incomes to help with the cost of living. It means more help for more people via the tax system by adjusting the Medicare levy low-income thresholds. It means 1.2 million Australians get to keep a little bit more of what they earn, and that's important. Most Australian residents pay the Medicare levy, charged at two per cent of their taxable income. We're increasing the low-income threshold by 7.1 per cent for singles, families, seniors and pensioners, in line with the average annual growth in the consumer price index.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said in this place many times, within my home community, the state of Tasmania, the Albanese government has tripled the bulk-billing incentives, supporting 11.6 million Australians to access a GP with no out-of-pocket expense. In my home state of Tasmania, that means an awful lot. We're an older population, so getting in to see your GP is so important. It's also important to reward those GPs to allow them to assess and to bulk-bill more people. On top of that, the state Labor opposition are promising to take away payroll tax on GP surgeries. That is going to have a huge impact in my home state of Tasmania. They do it in some other states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as usual, whether it's in this place or in my home state of Tasmania, if there is something sensible that's been brought on by Labor, the Liberals will say no to it, as they have done on that side since they've been in opposition. The word most frequently used by those on that side of the chamber is 'no'. They said no to any increase in aged-care workers' pay. To all Australians getting an increase in their wages and supporting their case, what did they say? No. To our energy bill relief, they said no. And then they come into this chamber during this debate and try and assert that somehow their plan was so much better. How could it be better when the majority of Australians who work would not have been any better off? How can they say that when they were only looking after the big end of town—people on $200,000 and more?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to see equity and fairness. If you work hard, you should be able to keep more of your money. We are doing things like reducing the cost of medications, which helps all families to be able to meet those pharmacy costs. We have made child care cheaper so that more women, if they choose, can go back to work, so child care becomes more affordable. We know that by making medicines cheaper in this country the savings to the Australian population over the last year alone were $250 million, spread across Australian households who have saved on their medication. That is amazing. We introduced the 60-day script. I might add that it was recommended in 2018 that those opposite, when they were in government, take that same step to reduce the amount of visits to GPs, to reduce the cost of medication, and they said no. The Pharmacy Guild in this country was so strong that those opposite decided not to proceed with that advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming into government, we were given that advice to introduce 60-day scripts. We could see the economic changes that had happened throughout the 10 years of inept government from those opposite. And so, despite the campaign they ran against us—and I understand the Pharmacy Guild and pharmacists were concerned about their own income levels. There was a threat that pharmacies would close across the country, across my home state. I'm pleased to say there have been no closures in my home state at all. But what we have seen are fewer visits to GPs for repeat prescriptions. Now, if the doctor chooses and the patient wants to take up that option, they have to see their doctor less frequently. That's the reality of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what did those people opposite do when we brought that in? They voted against it because they always, always look after the strong lobbyists who are lobbying in their own self-interest. So I'm really proud of the fact that, as a Labor government, we stood up to the Pharmacy Guild and we are delivering those savings. And we are allowing GPs to see more patients and making access to GPs much easier than what it has been. Is there still a way to go? Yes, there is. Is there more that needs to be done to get more GPs in rural and regional areas? Of course there is. There's a lot more work to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But while we're doing that and investing in those very important things like education—I'm sure that later this week I'll get to talk about higher education and a report that's just been handed to a minister. We're opening up universities to more students, to those who come from less well-off backgrounds, which is really important. But it's also about how you do those things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, like those opposite, the Greens come in here and espouse all these great ideas about spending money but they never, ever have to deliver on them. We had to change things because of the circumstances that our economy was in—interest rates hikes and the cost-of-living pressure that has been brought on from international markets and not just from what's happening here in Australia. We then said we had to change the stage 3 tax cuts for them to go ahead. It was hard to break an election commitment, which we said we wouldn't do, but you cannot, as a responsible, mature government, ignore the economic circumstances of the day. A government will fail the Australian people if it's not prepared to make the changes that are necessary because five years ago, when they were first suggested and the legislation was passed, the economy was different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are taking responsibility. We take responsibility in trying to ease the pressure on Australian families and that all Australians are feeling right now, especially those on lower incomes. We have to look after our young people, who are trying to establish themselves, whether they're at uni or in their first job or they're doing an apprenticeship. We also have to look after our seniors. We have to look after women. This will give more women money in their pay packets as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is 100 per cent focused on getting the cost of living and inflation under control. What would be really mature is to see everyone in this chamber supporting these two pieces of legislation. If you're really interested in making real changes for every Australian and what they take home in their pay packet and how they're able to deal with this cost-of-living pressure that they're experiencing at the moment—and no-one denies that. No-one denies that. We know that. We feel that. I listen to people in the community. I know how hard it is. I go to the supermarket and I see that people are thinking twice: 'Do I take this and put this in my trolley or don't I?' We are being responsible and addressing the imbalance of the former stage 3 tax cuts. I commend these two pieces of legislation to the chamber and I hope they're supported.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  The country has a very high level of reliance upon income tax, and we're also a very heavily taxed nation when you look at other countries around the globe. We tax people and companies very heavily. When you look at some of the OECD analysis, you will see that we are making it very hard to support people who want to work hard and be rewarded for their labour, because when you work for a large part of the year for the government it is a disincentive. We want to have a country where people are heavily incentivised to work as much as they would like to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of the only reforms of the past decade. You'd have to say, when they write the books about this period of Australian history, it may not be a very exciting book if it's a book about Australian taxation history. Certainly, if there are any monographs, articles or books written about this period of economic policy in Australia, you'd have to say it's a period of very low ambition. The only reform put forward to counter the scourge of bracket creep, which is not a new issue—in fact, if you go back to the 1970s, there were efforts to rein in bracket creep through the indexation of the personal income tax scale. It was an interesting and short-lived idea. This is not a new issue. So, the point of the stage 3 tax cuts—stages 1, 2 and 3—was to address and seriously tame bracket creep. That was the point of it. That was the only serious attempt at any form of personal income tax reform and, frankly, one of the only serious efforts at any economic reform in last decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 closes the book on the only effort to make an economic policy reform in our recent history. It is a depressing day for the parliament, because we are already living in a period of very low ambition, and we're passing the buck in a whole range of areas onto younger people. No wonder younger people are so disappointed with their parliamentarians. This is just another example of us giving up on the future by saying: 'Look, it's too hard to address bracket creep, so we're going to reinstate a tax bracket. We're going to reinstate a tax bracket that we removed as a reform. We're going to put in place the 37c in the dollar tax bracket, because it was too hard to sustain a reform for just a few years.' That is why I have to say that I'm miffed that here we are, only a year and a half into this term, where the government has zero economic reform interest, and it is closing the door on one of the only reforms passed in the last few parliaments. In doing so—to make all the general political points—it is, of course, breaking a promise. It was a promise that it made not at one election but two elections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this all happening? There's a by-election in Victoria in the next few weeks, and the government had a very messy end to last year, and this is in part political management. We all understand that. We all get that. But why is it really happening, other than the day-to-day political management and the need to try and ensure the best possible result for the Prime Minister at the Dunkley by-election? I would say this is partly a consequence of the government having run the country in the interests of a very small group of vested interests for the past 18 months. These are the unions and the major super funds, where the major beneficiaries receive not just policy but also taxpayer funds. We have seen a litany of bills since the parliament commenced after the May 2022 election. The government occupies almost all of its legislative agenda on policy for unions and for super funds. That is all they have time to do. The great economic problem the country has is a very simple problem. When the government is only interested in working for unions and super funds, it has no time to solve the major issues facing Australians—housing and inflation, for example. That is the central problem facing Australians today—that the government are more interested in serving their vested interests, who put them into parliament, fund their campaigns and look after them generally, than in looking at the interests of all the people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 10,000 new public servants here in Canberra, pattern bargaining and laws for super funds to help them lock away your money forever and ever, even if you need it for a rainy day. These are the skewed priorities of the government for vested interests. It all comes home to roost, because of course there is a great cost to this, because you're not thinking about how you can incentivise business to invest more and you're not thinking about how you can solve the great problem facing the under 40s in this country—housing. You're not doing any of those things because all you're doing is shovelling policy and money to your favourite vested interests, who run your preselections, fund your campaigns and the like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why this had to be a recalibration. There was probably a realisation over summer that the government didn't have any economic policies and that it might be a good idea to have something which is a semblance of a policy as they go into a by-election. That is effectively why the stage 3 recalibration was necessary. It was necessary for a political reset for a Prime Minister who has only run the government in favour of vested interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having already needed to recalibrate stage 3 and having needed to break another election commitment—not to tax super—the government now is flagging that it will consider further taxation measures, and there is a real risk that the government will be suckered into taxing the family home or increasing taxes on housing. It could be interested in taxing trusts. This is the cost that all Australians pay. They pay the higher taxes that are necessary to fund things like 10,000 new public servants in Canberra. That is the major issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to our position on this legislation—this has been well canvassed and flagged—we will not be standing in the way of tax relief for any Australian, because we've always supported lower taxes. But it is important that people are aware of what this tax cut actually is. It's a tax cut today, but it's a tax increase tomorrow, because this locks in permanently higher taxes. It locks in bracket creep. By reintroducing the 37c in the dollar threshold, it guarantees that more Australians will pay higher taxes on a permanent basis. It is unbelievable that we are going to pass a bill that is going to reintroduce a tax bracket which was abolished in the name of eliminating bracket creep, but that is what is going to happen because of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that, for Australians earning between $135,000 and $190,000, they will now pay a higher tax rate of 25.14 per cent, rather than an average tax rate of 24.66 per cent, because of these changes. And there will be 2.6 million people paying higher taxes by the end of the decade. That is just a taste of bracket creep being baked back into the system—2.6 million people will pay higher taxes because of Labor's broken promise on stage 3. These are the numbers that have been generated by the Parliamentary Budget Office. These are the numbers which I would have thought would have been available when we had Senate estimates only in the last few days. But these were the questions that were put to the Treasury and put to the Labor ministers at the table, and they claimed they didn't know. The PBO, the Parliamentary Budget Office, is able to tell us, based on the Treasury data, that 2.6 million people will pay higher taxes because of the reinsertion of 37c. But the Labor Party are seeking to cover up this fact because they don't want people to know that their tax cuts today are tax increases tomorrow. That is the central problem here. It is a short-term sugar hit to suit a flagging prime minister's political interests ahead of a by-election. So they're now saying that they're going to base the whole tax system around one by-election in one seat in one state and are not going to take the long view and say: 'Yes. We agree that the 37c tax bracket should be gone for all time, because when people work an extra shift or do a longer set of hours at work they should be rewarded and not have to face the scourge of a higher tax bracket in the long term.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If our ambition today is going to be continued over the medium term, there is no way that the country is ever going to address bracket creep. We will perpetually have a situation where people who are doing extra jobs and extra shifts will be hit with higher taxes. It will also mean that future Commonwealth budget surpluses will be based on the scourge of bracket creep. It might look good for treasurers now and in the future. They might be able to say, 'I've delivered a budget surplus.' But they've only delivered a budget surplus because they're hitting Australians with higher taxes over that medium to long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, there will be a choice at the next election, where the Liberal and Nationals parties will have a plan for lower taxes and we will have a plan to beat the scourge of bracket creep, because we do believe that Australians are paying too much income tax. We are happy to wave through the lower taxes that are included in this bill, but we're not happy about the reinsertion of 37c. Our plan will be to address bracket creep, particularly for people earning between $135,000 and $190,000, over the medium term, because we believe that, no matter who you are, you should not face disincentives to work harder, do more jobs and take more shifts. We need people to work harder and longer, because we have a long-term structural position in our budget which is not so flash. There are unfunded commitments, which are important commitments to the Australian people, that we want to keep. We will only be able to keep those commitments if there are the right sorts of economic settings that encourage people to work hard. Of course we want to collect taxation from people where it is necessary to pay for services, but we should not be waving the white flag on tax reform. We are doing that today by effectively saying that we are giving up on bracket creep and we are closing the book on the only personal income tax reform of the last decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I regret that we are doing this, but it is important that the parliament doesn't stand in the way of a tax cut for people now. It is very important that the people of Australia know that the coalition will have a policy for the next election which will address bracket creep in a meaningful way so that you can do an extra shift, you can work harder, and keep the money for yourself rather than send it off to Canberra for a budget surplus.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  I rise to speak to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the associated bill. Like most of the words Australians hear out of Liberal and Labor mouths, the title of this bill is a false promise. It's a lie. It's almost a sick joke from the Labor government to even put the words 'cost of living' in this bill. Let's talk about the cost of living. Compared to what was already legislated, these tax changes are $15 a week different for the average Australian. For many that's significant because of Labor's huge cost-of-living increases. In four years, Australians have been slapped with some of the worst declines in economic circumstances in decades internationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian households suffered the fastest income collapse in the world last financial year, under Labor. Inflation has sent Australian wages—real wages—back to a point not seen since 2009. That means that Australian wages have gone nowhere in real terms for 15 years. The average mortgage has gone up $1,210 a month—a month! Australia's average rent has hit a record $601 a week, up from the August 2022 median of $437 by an astounding 37 per cent. Fifty dollars doesn't get you far at the supermarket anymore. Petrol is now considered a bargain at $1.80. How far we've fallen!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As billions in government coupons and rebates expire, power bills will rise even further. Despite Labor's promises to cut electricity bills by $275, Australians have never paid more to keep the lights on. We've never paid more. We have the highest electricity prices in the world. We used to have the lowest—until Labor and the Greens and teals came along.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the government's solution to these skyrocketing costs of living? To fix your problems with groceries, your mortgage or rent, power bills and more, the Albanese government is going to give some Australians—some Australians—$15 a week and expect you to bow down and thank them for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the governments before it, this Labor government is all spin and no substance. In fact, it's all theft. They will put a fluffy title on a bill, like they have here: 'cost of living tax cuts'. Oh, really! In reality, this won't make a dent in the cost of living most Australians are suffering through. The costs Labor is imposing are far, far higher than the minor changes they've made. This bill is a perfect example of how out of touch this Albanese Labor government really is. Their priorities are in the wrong place. They're more interested in looking good than actually doing good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his speech about this bill, Treasurer Jim Chalmers just couldn't help himself. He needed to invoke identity politics and explain that these tax cuts were so much better for women. I checked the Taxation Office website, just to make sure nothing had changed, and it hadn't. Someone might want to let Treasurer Chalmers knows that Australia doesn't charge different tax rates based on what's between our legs. There's no table that says, 'If you earn $60,000, as a man you'll pay, say, 32.5c per dollar, and, if you're a woman, you'll pay 35c.' That's probably lucky, because Labor can't even answer the question: 'What is a woman?' If the Treasurer can't make a speech about tax without invoking gender political correctness, you have to wonder what hope they've got. What hope have we got? Here's a tip for Labor: regardless of what Australians have between our legs, life is tough right now; the economy sucks; and $15 a week will barely make a dent in the extra costs you have imposed in just 18 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I'll never oppose Australians getting a tax cut. Yet calling these tax changes 'cost-of-living relief' is like claiming you've fixed a raging bushfire after throwing cup of water on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These tax changes won't do anything while government policies make Australia's cost of living even worse—far, far worse. There's energy. They're killing agriculture. There's immigration. They're hiding per capita recessions. There are house prices and rents. The government response to COVID created the inflation problem that has wrecked Australian households. And Labor was all the way with Prime Minister Morrison.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's net zero policies are increasing power prices, making it harder for households to keep the lights on and businesses to keep their doors open. That's a fact. Only this week, the government is discussing putting an extra four per cent tax on clothes, to comply with United Nations/World Economic Forum policies—four per cent on clothes, in addition to the 10 per cent GST on clothes. The government will be putting an emissions tax on vehicles, forcing Australians' favourite utes off the road and making any other cars far more expensive. That's from a Labor government. All of the pressures facing Australian households are a result of government policies, and Labor's response is a measly $15 a week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals do not get a free pass on this. The only reason we're in this situation is the Liberal Party's gutlessness in parliament. Many will notice that the original tax changes were called 'the third stage'. All three stages were announced by the Liberal coalition government in 2018. Why, then, was stage 3 left until 1 July 2024 to come into effect? I'll tell you why: the truth is the Liberals wanted to leave the stage 3 cuts as a trap for Labor, who have always been opposed to them. If the Liberals were genuine about stage 3, why didn't the changes come into effect five years ago? That didn't happen, because the Liberals wanted to play cynical political games and trap Labor. Neither Liberal nor Labor are interested in genuine tax reform; they'd rather play games with it to get a headline—play games with people's livelihoods, lives and futures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The crown of destroying Australia sits on the heads of both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. They both have gutless policy on everything in our country, especially tax. They run away from the real issues facing Australians. The Treasurer and the government claim that these tax changes won't add to inflation. That's shooting themselves in the foot. If that's true then the government is admitting that these changes won't do anything. They're saying it won't make enough of a difference to the amount of money Australians will have to spend to even be measured. Maybe the government is lying, and these changes will make inflation worse. That would be embarrassing to admit, given that Treasurer Chalmers says our No. 1 priority should be 'to finish the fight against inflation'. Labor appears to have put themselves between a rock and a hard place, a situation all of their own making. Australians have got used to this Labor government speaking out of both sides of their mouth. This tax bill is no different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I'll never oppose tax cuts for Australians. These tax changes, however, are just fiddling around the edges. Instead, we need real tax reform. Real reform is in the amendment I have proposed on sheet 2342. This would index the income tax thresholds to inflation and eliminate bracket creep. This is genuine tax reform. Bracket creep is the government's dirty little secret. Inflation means Labor will quietly pocket tens of billions of dollars in extra taxes by simply doing nothing. As wages increase with inflation, they go into higher tax brackets; you're paying higher tax rates and no one says a thing. We are going to say something. We've been saying something about this ever since this debate started, and we will fix it by putting an amendment in there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a stealth tax. As wages increase, Australians move into higher tax brackets while being able to buy only the same things due to inflation, yet they'll be paying more tax, so they'll effectively have less money to spend on groceries and less disposable income. Bracket creep amounts to a secret tax that the government keep collecting to pay for their pet projects of questionable benefit. If the Liberals and Labor want to increase taxes, they should put in a bill or take it to an election and be honest with Australians, rather than quietly rely on bracket creep to secretly plug their budget holes and ratchet up income tax receipts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bracket creep should've been fixed a decade ago. Analysis from the Parliamentary Budget Office shows that Australians have had to pay an extra $44 billion over the last decade because of bracket creep. Shh, don't tell them! Because we didn't take that action and fix this 10 years ago, over just the next four years bracket creep will mean Australians will pay more than $38 billion extra in taxes. You thought you were getting a tax cut. If the government gets inflation under control, fixing bracket creep won't cost the budget anything. Australians don't deserve to pay for inflation twice because of government mistakes, and the budget shouldn't benefit from out-of-control inflation. Here's how you're paying twice: firstly, inflation, because of an out-of-control government—higher prices—and secondly, being put into a higher tax bracket because of the higher wages that come with inflation. You have less real money overall. Now, I note that the Liberals have made many comments about the scourge of bracket creep. This is your opportunity to fix it once and for all, and I urge all senators to stop the taxation increases by stealth and index the tax thresholds—the brackets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor need any suggestions on areas of spending to fix it so they don't have to keep secretly stealing more money from Australians, they can consult One Nation's extensive work at Senate estimates for a few tips. There are lots of tips in there. We exposed so much: the flawed $65 billion Hunter frigate program they fiddled with and didn't cancel; the NDIS being on track to cost $100 billion every year; and up to $8 billion a year in Medicare fraud. They are all some good places to start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support this bill. It's being dishonestly represented by Labor as a tax cut; it's a tax fiddle. We can change that by passing my amendment to remove bracket creep. As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I recommend that, instead of fiddling with the tax system, we fix the tax system. Reform the tax system for the benefit of all Australians, all families, our economy and our grandchildren's economic future and security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just make some comments about tax reform, in connection with this bill. The tax system is complex, wastes enormous resources and is destroying economic productivity. Tax is essentially necessary because it's a cost of government. It has become the cost of unaccountable waste over government needlessly micromanaging and controlling people's lives and destroying economic initiative, hope and security. That's what our tax system has become. It's necessary as a cost of government, but it has now gone overboard. The tax act is immense—thousands of pages, a feast for lawyers and accountants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a highly competitive international market, our resources are being wasted. Instead of our best and brightest accountants helping us to be more competitive in facing our international competitors, companies in Korea, Japan, China, America, Indonesia and Asia—instead of facing them and being more competitive by putting our best people to work, we've tied them up in the tax system trying to dodge tax because it's so damn complex and so inefficient. Jim Killaly, the deputy commissioner who was responsible for international matters and large companies, who was second in charge at the Australian Taxation Office and in charge of large companies and international matters, said twice, in 1996 and 2010, that 90 per cent of Australia's large companies are foreign owned and, since 1953, have paid little or no company tax due to the Liberals introducing legislation exempting foreign companies back in 1953.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tax act enables companies to use tax tricks such as transfer pricing to eliminate book profits and tax being paid in Australia and take it all overseas. In 1987, the Hawke Labor government introduced a petroleum rent resource tax that effectively exempted the world's largest tax evader, Chevron, from paying tax. They steal our gas and export it to other countries, and we don't get much for it at all. The Liberal-Labor party, the uni-party, are working for their global corporate masters. Exempting corporations from paying their fair share of tax means the burden falls on us, the people. To the people in the gallery: you're paying for these uni-party rorts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aussies are paying far too much tax already. Former Treasurer Joe Hockey said that typical Aussies work from January to June paying tax. Half of the year paying tax, effectively a 50 per cent tax rate—that's what Joe Hockey said. And then we get to keep the rest from July to December. Industry figures calculate that almost 50 per cent of the price of a house is tax, meaning an effective tax rate of 100 per cent. Brisbane accountant Derek Smith said that 50 per cent of the price of a loaf of bread is tax, meaning the effective tax rate is 100 per cent. Seventy per cent of the price of fuel is tax—or it used to be; the price has gone up even higher now. Essentially, workers have to pay double and they're getting ripped off. They pay income tax, and, with what's left, they pay taxes on everything they buy. We need tax reform urgently.</span>

The tax package readjustment the Labor government has put forward, in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the associated bill, will see bigger tax cuts going to those that need them most. A median income earner in the electorate of Canning—and the median income in the electorate of Canning is fairly close to the national average—will now have $1,059 per year in extra income. This can be compared with a tax cut of just $255 under the previous government's plan. That is about a 315 per cent increase: 315 per cent extra income compared with what the coalition offered. Importantly, it is real cost-of-living relief. It equates to about five months worth of petrol for a car with a 37-litre tank, five weeks of groceries for a $200 weekly grocery shop or more than 12 months of an $85-a-month home internet and phone bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is real cost-of-living relief, and it is relief that is very much needed. In the electorate of Canning, households who are renting—some 30 per cent of households—are paying more than 30 per cent of their household income in rent. There are 38 per cent of households renting that pay more than 30 per cent of their household income in rent. The median mortgage repayment is some $1,800 a month, and 13.1 per cent of households pay more than 30 per cent of their household income on paying their mortgage. If you look at this around the state of Western Australia as an example, it shows that this will make a very meaningful difference to Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is all very well for those opposite to talk about bracket creep, to talk about aspirational politics in terms of people's future incomes. But they seem to forget how far away the median income of working Australians actually is from those upper tax brackets, how far from fair what they offered up to Australia in the form of these stage 3 tax cuts really was.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If things need to be changed in the future, then that's what a good government should do, just as we have done in this case, when Australians are facing increased cost-of-living pressures and knew full well that they were getting a dud deal from those opposite in the tax package that they put forward. It is time for childcare workers, tradies, truckies, teachers, nurses, disability carers and healthcare workers to get the tax cut that they deserve.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:08</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024. And I rise here today as a conservative, and as a conservative I support the passage of these bills, because I support tax cuts. I do have some qualifications, though, and some caveats, because there are some things that have been outlined by my colleagues and others here—and I'll do the same—that deeply concern me about the agenda of this government and the way they have approached this issue, and I'll seek to lay that out before you now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition are committed to lower, simpler and fairer taxes, which is why we will not oppose the reduction in the 19c tax rate to 16c. Tax cuts are a political shibboleth for conservatives. They're an absolute touchstone. After all, it's not the government's money; it's taxpayers' money. It's your money. Regrettably, until the last couple of years, tax cuts had dropped off the political agenda for far too long. It was a bold Morrison government that brought in these tax cuts that were legislated—they are legislated!—and that we're seeking to amend here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, why are tax cuts important? They are always important, but particularly so during the unprecedented cost-of-living crisis that Australians are facing right now. Australians are facing a cost-of-living crisis right now, and you know it. Keeping more money in the back pockets of Australians has never been more important. And as I said, I acknowledge the former Morrison government for putting tax cuts on the political agenda with its first two stages of tax cuts in our last term of government. Stages, 1, 2 and 3 went together to form our personal income tax plan, and 95 per cent of Australians would have seen a tax cut. This is important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill shines a light on yet another broken election commitment by this government. It erodes yet more integrity of this government, and it only had a shred of it left! When in opposition, the now Prime Minister repeatedly said a Labor government he leads would pass the stage 3 tax cuts in full. On 29 August 2022, in his address to the National Press Club, the now Prime Minister said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Parliament made a decision to legislate those tax cuts, and we made a decision that we would stand by that legislation rather than relitigate it, and we haven't changed our opinion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And as late as just a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister was still committed to it. And this is from a prime minister who said, 'My word is my bond'. That's what the Prime Minister said on TV two months after the May 2022 election. Well, some bond.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Integrity matters when it comes to leadership. Integrity matters when you're trying to convince Australians that you've got the best plan for them. And that's what Australians expect of their Prime Minister. So what has changed? What has possibly changed for the Prime Minister to go against his word, which he said was his bond? The only thing that I can really think of is the thing that's in front of us this Saturday. It's the Dunkley by-election. It's political opportunism that has changed. This bill is purely motivated to try to salvage the political standing of the Prime Minister, who, as we're seeing, is lagging in the polls, who can't convince Australians that he has their best interests at heart. So it must be that Labor's internal polling is showing that it's in trouble in the seat of Dunkley. So what is it that this government has come up with? It needed a magic trick to distract the electorate, and this is what the Treasurer's office has come up with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We said before the election that life won't be easy under Albanese. That, of course, is proving to be true. This government thinks that if it jumps on the tax cut bandwagon no-one will notice that it has broken an election commitment to deliver the stage 3 tax cuts. Well, the Australian public do know. The Australian public know that their real disposable incomes have collapsed by 8.6 per cent in the last 18 months through a combination of price increases outpacing wages, rising mortgage payments and rapid escalation in personal income taxes—27 per cent in 18 months—which is driven by bracket creep and other changes. The Australian public know that this government has failed to deliver cheaper electricity, which it repeatedly said that it would do prior to the last election—yet another broken promise. And the Australian public now know that they're worse off than they were before the 2022 election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has this government delivered? That is the question that's now on people's minds. It's got the failed referendum. It failed on that. What has it delivered? All that we can really point to is the negative effects. It's delivered higher cost-of-living pressures, greater trade union control in the workplace and a flatlining national productivity, which is a big problem that I've spoken a lot about in this chamber. This government has been doing everything in its powers to grow trade union control, suppressing productivity and giving people false hope with wage rises not matched with increased productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer has been strutting around, thinking the inflation crisis is over and getting his Labor premier mates to put pressure on the RBA to lower interest rates. They all received a rude awakening from the RBA at its most recent board meeting, didn't they? In deciding to keep interest rates on hold, in the board's statement on its February monetary policy decision, it said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While recent data indicate that inflation is easing, it remains high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the February <span style="font-style:italic;">Statement on monetary policy</span>, the bank said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Board expects that it will be some time yet before inflation is sustainably in the target range, and the Board remains resolute to return inflation to target in a reasonable timeframe. The path of interest rates that will best ensure this will depend upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks, and a further increase in interest rates cannot be ruled out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet the Treasurer is going around as if it's all over, as if it's finished, as if the pressure is off. But, while the Treasurer is giving his party room colleagues high fives, the RBA has warned that it will still be some time yet before inflation is sustainably in the target range.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just today, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fin Review </span>reported:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… inflation analysis showed labour costs made up almost two-thirds of headline CPI in the year to June 30, 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the government's own fiscal and wages policy that's supercharging inflation. That's what we're seeing. It means the RBA could be tempted to keep its rates higher for longer. Australians will continue to experience the pain of this government's economic mismanagement for some time yet. The radical industrial relations bill recently rammed through by the Labor and Greens alliance will only add further cost-of-living pressures for struggling families. The cost of running business has to be passed onto consumers. That's just the reality of it. Each time Australians go through the check-out at the supermarket, they know that they are paying more under the Albanese government. You only have to go into your community and talk to people and hear how families are struggling with the high cost-of-living pressures imposed on them by this government to see what I'm saying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been talking a bit about bracket creep here. I commend Senator Bragg on his excellent speech on this point. Indeed, Senator Roberts also spoke about this. President Reagan in May 1985 said, 'Death and taxes may be inevitable, but unjust taxes are not.' Bracket creep and payroll tax are insidious issues that we should be dealing with. Both are unjust and insidious taxes. The first is an aspiration tax, and the second is a job killer tax. What we seem to have in this situation in this country right now is a lack of political courage to deal with these issues. By retaining a fourth tax bracket, this government has failed to grasp the opportunity which stage 3 tax cuts would have delivered. It would have reduced the tax brackets from four to three, addressing that bracket creep problem that we have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those watching at home who may be unfamiliar, what is bracket creep, and why is it so hideous? Simply put, bracket creep occurs when rising incomes cause individuals to pay an increasing proportion of their income tax, even though there may not have been changes to tax rates and thresholds. Bracket creep particularly affects taxpayers earning just above a tax threshold. For those on low incomes, it may reduce the incentive to work. It reduces the value of a pay increase and disposable income. Under the coalition's stage 3 tax cuts, the 37 per cent marginal rate would have been abolished for those that earn $135,000 and above. This bracket would be impacted by bracket creep faster as wages rise with inflation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's new tax changes are a war on aspiration. With these new changes, the government has kicked the can down the road to a future government. At some point, this has to be dealt with, and this government has decided to turn its back on its commitments to the Australian people. Before the election, after the election and even for two weeks before this bill was introduced, this wasn't going to happen. But a future government will come under pressure to return future bracket creeps in tax cuts. The Albanese government has gone for short-term political expediency—a sugar hit for the electorate in an election year. The government is only providing a short-term sugar hit and not addressing the long-term insidious consequences of bracket creep. A Labor government has never not liked a tax, so why would they remove a tax bracket? It's little wonder that an article on 25 January in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> remarked:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The contrast underscores the opportunity cost of using a significant tax scale change for political purposes. Such opportunities rarely occur more than once every few terms of government. They ought to be applied to bedding down structural improvements in the tax system, rather than on fixing short-term political or even business cycle concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this government is choosing short-term 'sugar hit' political aims rather than tackling the fundamental issues that our economy and Australian households are facing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In alliance with their left-wing allies, the Australian Greens, the government would tax everything that wasn't fastened down. This bill, undoubtedly, makes the structural problem of bracket creep even worse for Middle Australia. According to the 2023 <span style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ntergenerational report</span>, personal income tax receipts were forecast to be 11.7 per cent of GDP in 2023. Listen to this: it's projected to rise under this government due to this bill to 13.5 per cent by 2033-34. When the country needed a serious economic decision on structural tax reform, this government didn't have the stomach for it. It's a problem that this government cannot continue to ignore into the future.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  Imagine being the government of this wealthy country and seeing that millions living in Australia are suffering through a cost-of-living crisis. Then imagine being presented with a choice of how best to spend $318 billion. What would you do? How would you spend the money in a way that is fair and that improves people's lives? Labor has given us completely the wrong answer. It has failed the test of basic fairness once again. Labor's answer to the cost-of-living crisis is to give 50 per cent of the $300-odd billion in tax cuts to the wealthiest 20 per cent of society and to give just 0.4 per cent of the money to the poorest 20 per cent. That is what Labor's tax plan will do: $150 billion to the wealthiest 20 per cent and just $1 billion to the poorest 20 per cent. What a disgrace! How grossly unfair and insulting to all those who are struggling right now to put food on the table and pay their rent, and those who are being crushed under student debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear how wrong Prime Minister Albanese is when he says his tax plan means no-one left behind. If you're one of the millions of Australians relying totally on income support or earning less than $18,000 a year, you don't get a cent from this plan. That's called Labor leaving you behind. If you're a middle-income earner under this plan, you get three times less in tax cuts than politicians, CEOs and billionaires. Labor is leaving you behind too. If you're struggling to keep up with the cost of groceries or with increases to rent and mortgage payments, this plan will hardly make a dent in your bills. While the rich get richer, while corporations make megaprofits, again and again Labor is leaving ordinary people to fend for themselves. That's called leaving people behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of focusing on helping low- and middle-income earners through this cost-of-living crisis, Labor are giving $80 billion in tax cuts to politicians, CEOs and billionaires. They haven't given any reason for doing this, because there is no good reason; it's simply indefensible. CEOs and people earning the highest incomes don't need a $4½ thousand tax cut. Billionaires like Andrew Forrest and Gina Rinehart, who earn $1.5 million in just one hour, don't need a $4½ thousand tax cut. It makes no sense at all. Just imagine, Mr Deputy President, all the things that we actually could do with $318 billion, which is the price of these tax cuts. We could wipe student debt and make TAFE and uni free. We could put dental into Medicare and provide free and universal early learning and care for all. We could build hundreds of thousands of publicly funded homes and end the waiting list for social housing three times over. We could make public transport free for all and build the clean energy system that our planet needs. These are the universal services that would benefit everyone, services that would help to overcome gender inequity—rather than worsening it, as Labor's tax cuts do, with 42 per cent of the cuts going to women and 58 per cent to men. These universal services would stand the test of time. Instead, this bit of cash will be swallowed up by the landlord's next unfair rent increase—because Labor does back unlimited rent increases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A mere $15 extra per week is what Labor is asking middle-income earners to be satisfied with under this plan—an extra $15 a week—while, under Labor's housing and rental crisis, average rents have increased by a hundred dollars a week and average mortgage payments have gone up by nearly $200 a week. This is just not good enough. If Labor were serious about addressing the cost-of-living crisis and the housing and rental crisis, they would tax billionaires and big corporations. If Labor were serious about leaving no-one behind, they would use this money to fund essential services for everyone, not give another whopping advantage to the top end of town. The truth is that Labor don't have the guts to stand up to big corporations and their corporate donors, who continue to pay almost no tax as workers are left to pick up the tab. Take the climate destroyer Santos, for example, which earned a whopping $5.8 billion in profit in 2022 and paid just $16,000 in tax—far less tax than that paid even by an average Australian worker. This is the same company that has donated $1.5 million to the major parties over the last decade and whose climate-wrecking gas mines Labor continues to approve in the middle of a climate emergency, in the middle of a time when the globe is boiling. Labor is totally captured by its corporate donors and continues to do their bidding. What an absolute rort!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whenever Labor says it's too expensive to lift people out of poverty or to fund critical services, just remember it's because Labor keeps choosing to look after its corporate mates and the superwealthy, rather than people who live here. Whenever Labor says it is too expensive to make TAFE or uni free, or to provide universal and free early learning and care, just remember it's because Labor's tax cuts are for the wealthy and for the corporations, and their subsidies are for the fossil fuel companies—while life gets harder for everyone else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People are entitled to expect a bit more from Labor than for them to effectively tell us, 'Oh, look: we made the tax cuts a bit less crap than the coalition did.' People are skipping basic essentials. Labor keeps telling us that, but then doing the exact opposite. People are missing out on the care that they need because they simply cannot afford it. So if Labor is going to come back and revise the coalition's tax cuts, they should do something that will actually make a change and a difference to people over the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are the only ones in here who have, from day one, continuously opposed the coalition's tax cuts for the billionaires and the politicians which the crossbench at that time backed in, and Labor followed. It took years of Greens and community pressure to finally get Labor to shift on the Liberals' stage 3 tax cuts. So, clearly, pressure does work. But Labor could be doing so much more to help people through this cost-of-living crisis. The Greens won't stop pushing them until they put the interests of the people and the planet above those of corporations and billionaires.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MARIELLE SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:31</span>):  I also rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024. These bills are about fairness. They're about delivering more relief to the Australian people in a way that is fiscally responsible and that doesn't add pressure to inflation. And they are about making our tax system fairer, because these are difficult times. A pandemic, global conflict, natural environmental disasters, persistent inflation and higher interest rates have dramatically changed the world around us. When the former government's plan was legislated five years ago, the world was a very different place. It was before that pandemic, before the persistent inflation we've seen, before two conflicts and before the global uncertainty we're currently living with. When circumstances change like this, responsible government should change with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills before us present the right thing to do. It's the right thing to do for the Australian people, the right thing for middle Australia and the right thing for our economy. These bills will deliver more relief to more people in a way that is fiscally responsible and doesn't further add to inflationary pressures. It's fairer because it delivers a tax cut for all Australians, not just some, and it makes our system fairer too. This bill returns bracket creep for all taxpayers and does more to reduce the impact on those most burdened by it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my state of South Australia, these bills will make a meaningful difference. They'll make a meaningful difference in a way that's economically responsible and not inflationary. In South Australia, 100 per cent of taxpayers will get a tax cut, and 89 per cent of taxpayers will get a bigger tax cut because of the Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women in South Australia—indeed, all women across our country—will get a tax cut to the tune of $1,600 each year on average. We know that 5.8 million women across our country will get a bigger tax cut than they would have if we were still under the former coalition government. I've spoken many times in this chamber about things like the gender pay gap and structural issues in our economy that have let women down, especially women working in particular industries like early learning, teaching, nursing and disability support. These women will get a significantly bigger tax cut under Labor. Women who would have never got a tax cut under the former government will get one now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about delivering reform that is better for the majority of Australians. It delivers more relief to those who really need it. It is the right thing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the opposition are going to support this today, but the Australian people should be very, very wary of reading anything into that. Simply, they shouldn't believe in it, because who can forget the words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when she said that it was absolutely their position to roll back these changes—to roll back these tax cuts. Deep down, that's what they believe. Those across the aisle initially sought to oppose this bill before they had even read it. They wanted to oppose this policy before they'd understood it. That should tell the Australian people everything it needs to about the opposition's position on tax cuts and who tax cuts should go to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our tax cuts are good for the majority of Australians, for the majority of women and for the majority of people in my state, who will benefit from this relief. These are tax cuts which will not be inflationary; these are tax cuts which are economically responsible. They are tax cuts which will make a real difference in the lives of people in my state. This is the right thing to do. It's the fair thing to do. And I wholeheartedly support this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="274506" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHARMA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  This is not my first speech. Australia's in a cost-of-living recession right now. Over the past 18 months, we've seen real net disposable income per person fall by 8.6 per cent. This decline in household living standards has never been so dramatic and has never been so rapid. What we've seen in Australia is an average full-time earner on $95,000 a year see their real disposable income fall by over $8,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These workers are being hit by a triple tsunami. They're being hit by higher income tax because of bracket creep. Personal income tax collections have increased by 27 per cent since Labor came to office, which means that workers are taking home less of their pay. They're also being hit by higher mortgage repayments, the result of higher interest rates. There have now been 12 increases in the cash rate under this Labor government. In the past two years, we've seen mortgage repayments, on an economy-wide basis, go from $11 billion per quarter to $29 billion per quarter, an increase of $18 billion per quarter. So more of workers' take-home pay, which has already been reduced by bracket creep and growing taxes, has to go to servicing their mortgage. Finally—the third whammy—they're being hit by high inflation. As the RBA has reminded us, this is now a homegrown problem. The headline rate of inflation is too high; it's well above the RBA's target. We've seen food prices up by nine per cent. We've seen electricity prices up by 23 per cent—not $275 a year less, as we were promised by the Labor government. We've seen gas prices up by 29 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For workers, that means that the pay they are left with, after higher taxes and higher mortgage repayments, buys less—fewer groceries; less food on the table. It means less ability to meet back-to-school bills; less ability to pay for electricity and gas bills, which are going up each quarter; and less ability to fill up the car.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent figures from the OECD reveal this decline in living standards here in Australia quite starkly. In the 12 months to September 2023, Australian household incomes have fallen by 6.1 per cent, adjusted for inflation. This is the sharpest fall measured across any of the OECD economies over the same period. Over the same period, we've seen household incomes in the OECD, on average, go up by 1.7 per cent. In the United States, they've gone up by 2.6 per cent. In the United Kingdom, they've gone up by 3.2 per cent. In France, they're up by 0.3 per cent. But in Australia, household incomes, adjusted for inflation, have fallen by 6.1 per cent. That means that Australian real household incomes are now back to 2017 levels. If households are feeling poorer, families are finding it harder to put food on the table and people are worried about how they're going to pay their bills, that's because they are as wealthy or as poor as they were in 2017. People have gone no further ahead in seven years now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With these amended stage 3 tax cuts in the cost-of-living tax cuts bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, you would think, listening to some of those opposite, that Labor has fixed the cost-of-living crisis that they've presided over. But, if you look at the sums here, the person on an annual wage is going to receive only an extra $800 a year, or $15 a week, under these amended tax cuts. An average worker on $95,000 a year has lost $8,000 a year, or $150 a week, because of higher inflation, bracket creep and higher mortgage repayments, and all they are getting back from this government is an extra $800 a year, or $15 a week. They've lost $8,000 a year; they're getting back $800 a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is my main gripe with this legislation. Labor is seeking to alleviate the symptoms but not to treat the disease—the disease they have made considerably worse and continue to make worse: the disease of high inflation and rising cost of living. The economist Chris Richardson has described these tax cuts as a bandaid and said that higher productivity would be needed to drive better living standards. He's been quoted as saying: 'In Australia these days, we spend our time grabbing bits of pie from each other rather than growing the pie.' The Deloitte Access Economics partner Stephen Smith has said that, while the tax cuts would provide some relief to households, that will not be enough to offset the decline in living standards. He's said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Households have been dealing with the cost of living challenges that elevated inflation and rising interest rates impose. At the same time, bracket creep is ratcheting up the average rate of tax paid, while aggregate measures of income and economic growth are being driven by population growth, not productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are three major problems with this legislation. Firstly, it's insufficient. If you're an average worker, you've lost $8,000 a year in your real disposable household income, or $150 a week, and all you're getting back is an extra $800 a year, or $15 a week. But it's also doing nothing to address the root causes: high inflation and low productivity growth, which are the biggest burden on living standards and how Australian households are feeling right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the government's most important agenda in this parliament has been to alter our industrial relations landscape to make workplaces less flexible and to reduce the scope for enterprise bargaining and for wage rises linked to more productive and flexible workplaces. All these changes do is hurt productivity and contribute to wage price inflation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amended stage 3 tax cuts also entrench bracket creep, and bracket creep is at the heart of why Australians have less take-home income. The stage 3 tax cuts, unamended, would have returned significant portions of the proceeds of bracket creep. They would have simplified the tax system. And they would have restored incentive to our personal income tax rates. Under the plan unamended, 95 per cent of taxpayers would have been paying no more than a marginal rate of 30c in a dollar, whilst the plan would have retained the progressive character of our personal income tax system. But instead, with these amended changes, we see, from Treasury's own estimates, that they are expected to increase revenue by $28 billion over the next decade. It's not much of a tax cut if the Treasury is taking $28 billion over the next decade in additional tax revenue compared to the business-as-usual scenario.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia relies too much on income tax receipts in our tax system. We need to address that, and these changes today do nothing to address that. All they do is increase our dependence on income tax. Ultimately, it's workers and salary earners, who are often earning income but are quite asset poor, who are bearing more of the burden of our taxation system and having to fund more of the social services that Australians rightly expect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a better balance in our tax system. That is why the coalition—whilst not standing in the way of these tax cuts, because we recognise households are doing it tough—will take a policy proposal to the next election that will simplify our tax system, restore incentive and rebalance our tax system away from our dependence on income tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, this is a broken promise. And this is a question that goes to the heart of personal integrity and the integrity of any government. We know the Labor government voted for these stage 3 tax cuts. They went to the last election saying they would support the stage 3 tax cuts. They confirmed on over 100 separate occasions that they supported these tax cuts. We heard the Prime Minister say he was a man of his word, and that his word was his bond when it came to these things. Whilst they can cite extraordinary circumstances, I think we've seen from this government already that we cannot take them at their word. If they assure us again and again they do not plan to change parts of our tax system, we cannot take those assurances at face value. If they promise us they will do one thing—whether it's to acquire nuclear-powered submarines, not altering negative gearing or not altering the capital gains tax system—we can no longer take them at their word.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a prime minister and a government who spoke a lot about integrity in the last parliament; they spoke a lot about restoring trust in politicians and about restoring the public's faith in elected office, and I share those sentiments. I would like to see public faith restored in elected office in our parliament, but this cuts right across that. This is up there with Julia Gillard's promise not to introduce a carbon tax: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' It's up there with Paul Keating's abandonment of the 'l-a-w' tax cuts after the 1993 election. In fact, in many respects, it's even more egregious than that. You could argue, with Australia coming out of a recession in 1993-94, that the case for retaining the l-a-w tax cuts was no longer made. You could argue that after the 2010 election, when Julia Gillard had to form government with the Greens, she had to adjust her policies to make sure they were on board. But there are no such exigent circumstances here. This is a broken promise, pure and simple. Whilst the Australian people might be mildly grateful for an extra $15 a week—when they've lost $150 a week because of bracket creep, because of higher interest rates, because of high inflation—they will not forgive a government for so flagrantly breaching their promise, for breaching the commitment they made to the electorate, and for being so bereft of solutions to the broader challenges our economy faces—low productivity, increasingly inflexible workplaces and a government that is more focused on redistributing the pie rather than growing it for everybody.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LAMBIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  I've been thinking about that famous Benjamin Franklin quote, 'In this world, nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes.' You can also add, 'You can be absolutely certain that our major political parties are very good at arguing about tax and totally not good at doing anything about tax reform.' Since March last year I have been calling for the stage 3 tax cuts to be rejigged so that low- and middle-income earners can get some relief—and that was the right thing to do. If a government or leader gets something wrong, they should fix it. But there are other things that need fixing in our tax system, and it will take real courage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do we have the courage do that, or does the government of the day have the courage to do that? I doubt it. Our tax system was written in the 20th century, and that's a problem in itself. I'm not an economist, but most of them will tell you our tax system isn't match fit for the 21st century—and it certainly wasn't written before COVID came around. Australians want and need better services; that's what our tax system is supposed to pay for. But it's everyday Australians that carry most of that burden. Over the next 10 years our governments will have to spend a lot more on the NDIS, aged care, defence and our health system, and all this spending pressure will grow as Australians get older and the climate change weather events keep getting worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the OECD, Australia is a low-taxing nation compared to similar countries. We tax the pay packets of everyday Australians, but we let multinationals dodge millions of dollars of tax every year. Every year they keep dodging tax—why wouldn't they?—because the companies throw their hands in the air and say that they will have to leave. That's what they say: 'We will have to leave.' What a load of rubbish! Won't don't you play them at their game and say: 'Good—leave. Go find somewhere else to dig your iron ore.' Go on, tell them: 'Leave. If you don't want to pay your tax here properly, and you don't want to support this country, then get out of it.' No-one seems to have the courage. The Nationals and the major parties do not have the courage to hold them responsible and to make them pay their fair share. Many Australians out there, millions of them, are getting really sick of this. They've had enough. They're sick of picking up the burden when the multinationals are not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know the government gets more from young Australians out there paying back their HECS than they do from the oil and gas companies who operate here in this country? That in itself is shameful. You're prepared to rip off our kids instead of taking from the multinationals. That's where we are today in 2024. On top of that—not only is that bad enough—we also give the oil and gas companies $11 billion in subsidies. That's right, Australians. So we give them subsidies, and we don't tax them properly, but, don't worry, we'll pick on our young people out there, who don't have a big enough voice and enough cash in their pockets and can't make enough political donations, and we'll take the money off them. It is frightening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Taxation Office's eighth <span style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">orporate tax </span><span style="font-style:italic;">transparency </span><span style="font-style:italic;">report</span> looked at over 2,000 companies. Guess what? I know, Australians, this won't surprise you, but over a third of them didn't pay tax at all. They didn't pay tax. I guess, when you're paying no tax, that's an accountant's invoice that is worth paying, isn't it? Yes, it is. If you're an Australian earning good money, you can access lots of tax discounts like capital gains tax, negative gearing and family trust arrangements. The list goes on and on. These are available to all Australians but are accessed most by older and richer Australians. A substantial review of the tax system by former Treasury boss Ken Henry in 2009 made more than 100 recommendations. You wouldn't guess it out there, but guess what? Most of them have not been implemented. That's right; they haven't been implemented. There's nothing on you having independent inquiries, Senate inquiries, and House inquiries. Great! You make these recommendations, and they go back on the shelf. I wish we could give every dollar away for all those recommendations that are not put back out there and not spoken about again because of the lack of courage in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whenever there is talk of fixing these tax breaks, the media and politicians start talking about winners and losers. Scare campaigns pop up everywhere, especially at election time, and then it deteriorates into nastiness either about the top end of town or the so-called welfare cheats. That's where we're at—the blame game. We have to be adults about this, and we're a long way from it. We're like a bunch of two-year-olds, running around still in the cot, instead of saying: 'Something needs to be fixed. Let's fix it.' Because that's what a leader does; they fix it. We have to talk about tax reform, and we have to act on it. Fixing the stage 3 tax cuts doesn't count as reform. It's not even close. To be grown-ups and make the changes the experts recommend will require political courage, like I said, and that will mean both major parties leaving their donors and vested interests at the door. Just for once, I ask you to put this country before anything else. If you put this country, this nation before your donors and anything else, my goodness, the leaps and bounds that economically we could make in this country would be astounding. It would be absolutely astounding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's something the government could fix now. They could fix the dodgy GST deal the Morrison government did with Western Australia in 2018. I say this to Tasmanians especially, because you are set to lose $900 million in GST revenue very shortly. When this deal was done, the government told Australians that it was because the price of iron ore was expected to fall. Anyway, the price of iron ore didn't fall, and prices went up, and they have stayed up. The Prime Minister at the time, Scott Morrison, promised that other states and territories wouldn't be worse off and would be topped up. This top-up was supposed to cost about $2.3 billion. Guess what it's projected to cost today? It's $30 billion. Do you think the Labor Party over there is going to top up Tasmania with the money that was taken off by this side over here? I doubt it. Once again, this shows a lack of courage. We'll keep reminding them of the lack of courage as we're going into elections, no doubt. But, seriously, for that $900 million—or more now—to come out of Tasmania: whoa! I tell you what, the Treasurer has agreed to keep the top-up deal to Tasmania going, and that's a good thing, but fixing this dodgy deal would be better. As Saul Eslake, economist and proud Tasmanian, told the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, 'the smaller states, like Tasmania, South Australia and the NT, are going to face a fiscal cliff when that part of the deal ends'. He also made the excellent point that fixing the GST isn't about numbers; it's about votes. How about that? He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"The GST deal isn't Chalmers' fault, but no party is going to abandon it because of the politics of WA. Something is going to have to change because it can't continue."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, I'm just one of millions that know it doesn't come down to GST; it comes down to whether or not we have power and how many seats we can win. Those are not the best interests of the nation, never will be and never have been. I don't know where we lost that way, to be honest. In both these chambers we lost the way to put the nation first. And we have seriously lost our way. We need courage and we need political courage—the courage to talk about tax reform, the courage to listen to the experts and the courage to reform our tax system so that it's fair. Our young people out there have to stop coughing up most of it. It is shameful, like I've said before. We're supposed to be the land of the fair go. That's part of our values. Just a reminder in here, but we sure don't see that in our tax system.</span>

The Liberal and National parties want you to work longer for less. The first chance they get, they'll walk away from hardworking regional Australians who absolutely deserve a tax cut. Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts deliver more relief for Australians, allowing to them keep more of what they earn. On 1 July every Australian taxpayer will get a tax cut. That's 13.6 million Australians. That's 2.9 million more Australians than under the previous plan. The changes that Labor are attempting to push through this Senate today will also mean that more Australians get an even bigger tax cut than that which was promised before.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party gets it, and this compares starkly with the reaction of the Liberal and National parties. They've had more positions than a game of Twister. At first they claimed not to know what it was, but decided they were against it; next, they said they didn't have a position; and, finally, they decided, actually, it's a good idea, but through gritted teeth they have articulated a very slow and reluctant 'yes' to this legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the associated bill. What we see in the Senate today is the continuing whingefest that Labor would dare to make sure that you earn more and keep more of what you earn.</span>

Let's do the calculations, Mr Acting Deputy President. I don't want to come in here with just bombastic rhetoric; I'll back it up with hard numbers. Say the average person on $80,000 needs, if they're lucky, $60,000 a year to live on. They earn $80,000, they pay 20,000 in tax and they've got $60,000 left over. Let's not forget that the Labor Party are going to take 12 per cent of that income, so you're almost down to $50,000. Let's settle on $50,000 a year that you need, as an individual, to live on. The inflation rate has been running at five per cent for the last two years, so now we've got an inflation rate of 10 per cent over $50,000, which means the cost of living has gone up by at least $5,000 for an individual. That is for someone who is living very frugally, I might add. Anyone with a family and a couple of children probably needs $100,000 to live on; their cost of living has gone up by $10,000. Let's just settle on $8,000 being the rise in the cost of living for the average working family. What's Anthony Albanese and the Labor Party going to return to them on an annual basis? Eight hundred dollars, $16 a week or only 10 per cent to offset the cost of living. That is an utter disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party have had two years to deal with this. They could have kept the low- to middle-income tax offset going, the LMITO, which was worth $1,500 for people on $96,000 a year if they were really serious about helping low- to middle-income tax earners. But they didn't because Labor saved the $11 billion by withdrawing that low- to middle-income tax offset so they could get back in the black, so that Mr Chalmers, the Treasurer, could skite about getting the budget back into black. So, while the federal government's running a surplus, hardworking Australian families are at home going broke.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not only the cost of living. The cost of living goes up, so does the GST. The GST is applied to most goods and services as well, so GST collections have risen. The fuel excise has risen. The alcohol excise has risen. The cigarette excise has risen. Those of you still having the odd darb every now and then—that was a long time ago; you don't see many of them anymore, and that's just as well. But let's not forget the cost of living is through the roof, and that is the key issue here. In the six months between when the Prime Minister announced the changes to the tax cuts and 30 June the cost of living will have risen by more than what this tax offset will provide. So don't be fooled by the Labor Party saying: 'Look at us. Look at this hand. We're giving you $800.' Behind their back in this other hand is somewhere between a $5,000 to $10,000 increase in the cost of living. That is the key issue here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what is the No. 1 driver of cost of living in this country? It has been the reckless immigration rate that went from zero throughout the COVID era back to 500,000 people a year. The Australian workforce and Australian families were recovering from the government overreach throughout COVID. Many people were locked down, locked out et cetera. They had bills to pay because they got forced to stay in a hotel for two weeks, a $10,000 bill for merely wanting to go to a wedding or to go and see one of their loved ones if those loved ones had passed away. Many families were already doing it tough, and the Labor Party somehow thinks, 'We've got to keep the economy going because the economists in the Treasury need to show that we're still growing on a growth basis.' But on a per capita basis we're getting poorer, people. And we're getting poorer because of Labor's bad economic management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken many times before about the history of the Labor Party in the eighties and nineties and how they brought in this three-step policy. They brought in fascism in 1985 when they let the foreign banks rip. They destroyed our manufacturing sector, smashing our patriots who love to get on the tools, like any true patriot does. They introduced Marxism in 1990 when they said every child can go to university and come out brainwashed and broke and feeling sorry for themselves. And they introduced the communism piece de resistance in 1992 with superannuation, centralising $3 trillion in capital into the hands of a few industry funds, BlackRock and Vanguard. Not very democratic, and that has had a long-term impact on the productivity in this country because our secondary industries are struggling. And when our secondary industries struggle, we cannot add value to our raw materials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And when we did open up to the capital markets in 1985, with no restraints whatsoever, foreign debt rose from $8 billion in the four major banks to $800 billion in foreign debt by 2008. That drove house prices from four times earnings to 13 times earnings; it drove two parents back to work; it drove our kids into child care; it drove our children's rankings in world education standards down the world league ladders. I've spoken to many teachers from the seventies and eighties—a great era, when I went to school—and it was well-known that Australia was world class. It had a world-class education system that has been eroded by the Marxists that have infiltrated our universities and our school sectors. And that's a shame because most teachers do a fantastic job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I digress. We are talking about tax cuts here and about the need to protect the individual. Of course, the Labor Party love it. As I said, this is nothing but a great big distraction from a Prime Minister who does not know how to deal with the cost of living. We know that because, straightaway after he did the tax cuts, he turned up on the weekend going to Tay Tay in Sydney. Then he got on his jet aeroplane and sprayed out a heap more carbon dioxide emissions as he flew down to see Katy Perry and Richard Pratt. 'Oh gee, it's great! I really care about the battlers as I'm flying around Australia and the world, emitting all this CO2!' The humanity of it all. The temperature has probably risen another half-degree just since he hopped on the plane over the weekend! But that is what he's doing. He has no substance, this man. He has no substance, the Prime Minister.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to you: what is the Labor Party going to do about increasing productivity in this country? If you want to actually increase productivity in this country, we need to empower the individuals and the families. We do that by constantly decreasing the income tax rate and starting to increase the withholding tax rate on profits sent offshore. What people don't realise is that when Paul Keating let the foreign banks come into this country in 1985, with no restrictions whatsoever on how they lent that money, the interest that we pay to those foreign banks offshore was not taxed. That's right, peeps: it is not taxed. If you look at your large tax expenditure statement, you will see that there is an exemption for withholding tax; it was worth $2.8 billion last year and it's worth $2.2 billion this year. I'm talking about section 128F and the public offer test in the 1936 Income Tax Assessment Act. We need to start taxing profits that go offshore. We need to lift the rate of tax on profits that go offshore and we need to lower the taxes on the profits that are earnt here in Australia, because there is no greater way to control your country and increase the equity in your own country than retaining your own earnings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul Keating let those foreign banks in in 1985 and decided that, with the Button plan, he'd let manufacturing rip. Well, that was great! What happened with the Button plan in 1985 was that it destroyed manufacturing. Look at Victoria, once the jewel in the crown of the Liberal Party. It used to be a strong manufacturing state. It's now the jewel in the crown of the Labor Party because it's driven by universities and superannuation funds, the Marxists and the communists. There's barely a patriot left alive in Victoria. I tell you what: if the Marxism and the communism didn't get to them, thanks to those reckless policies of the Labor Party in the eighties and nineties, Dan Andrews just about beat them out of the state throughout COVID. What a disgrace!</span>

                    </a>  Yes, they've moved to Queensland. Heaven knows why, under Labor, but we won't go there. I haven't got time to talk about that. We've got to get back to reforming the tax act. To do that, and to reform the economy, we need lower taxes on the people that get out of bed every day and go to work, and we need lower taxes on productive income—the people who actually get on the tools. Some students can still go to universities; we still need our doctors and our engineers. I'm not saying every university degree isn't a good idea, but we need more of our children back into TAFE and back on the tools, adding value to our raw materials. I was speaking to a member of the Liberal Party last week who has seen the light. He originally thought privatising infrastructure was a good thing. He said to me: 'When it was first happening, I thought it was a good thing. But one of the things I didn't realise was that when they did that, they stopped training electricians and people with other important skills through government programs when the infrastructure was publicly owned.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the other thing we need to do if we want to lower taxes—increase the productive output of this country. As anyone who has ridden a bike knows, the lower the gear, the faster the cadence. So, if we can have lower taxes, we can increase the output in the country. We also want to lower the cost of doing business. How do we do that? We build more dams, more power stations, better roads, better railways, better ports and better communication infrastructure. I'm not against the retail arm of telecommunications being private, because it's high-speed, fast-moving goods, but we have to control our infrastructure. Of course, that was the piece de resistance of communism and Marxism—selling all our infrastructure. But if we can increase the production of goods and services then we can actually lower the tax rate. A greater volume multiplied by a lower tax rate will equal the same tax takings. So, if we want to lower taxes, we need to take other measures to get rid of the red tape, green tape, black tape and blue tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should also add that we need to close some loopholes in the tax act, such as for the education sector. Why don't universities have to pay for the income they earn from foreign students? Why do foreigners not have to pay capital gains tax on the sale of water rights? Why do they not have to pay capital gains tax on the sale of assets that are a non-portfolio asset? Why is it that foreign superannuation funds and sovereign wealth funds don't have to pay tax in Australia? That's a nice little switcheroo. When the Future Fund here invests in foreign offshore assets, they don't have to pay tax. Likewise, when foreign superannuation funds and sovereign wealth funds invest here, they don't have to pay tax. Of course, the argument is that it's a false economy because then they don't have to pay their bureaucrats as much when you pay them their defined benefits scheme. That's a rort if ever I've seen one. We ought to means test that one as well, which is a lazy $300 billion for about 130,000 retired bureaucrats down here, which works out at something like $1 million to $1½ million for every retired bureaucrat. That's not a bad gig if you can get it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, long story short, why is it that we have all these loopholes in the tax act for the elites and foreigners? Who picks up the tab? I'll tell you who picks up the tab: it's hardworking Australians, when they get out of bed and put their nose to the grindstone, through bracket creep when they pay their income taxes. If we want to lower income tax, we need to reform the tax act. You can come and give me a call, Labor Party; I'll help you do that. We need to build more infrastructure. We need to put the Australian working families first. We need to get our manufacturing industry up and running again. To do that, we've got to get our children back on the tools. I'm not against some children going to university, but not everyone needs to go to university to have a happy life. We need to get back on the tools, people. We need to learn how to sweat, work hard and understand what it's like to work on a factory floor again.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024. The Greens have fought the unfair stage 3 tax cuts for billionaires, CEOs and politicians ever since they were introduced by Mr Scott Morrison and agreed to by Labor. I'm very pleased that Labor has finally heeded the calls from the Greens, from economists and from ordinary people that billionaires don't need an extra $9,000 every year. But, unfortunately, they are still only tinkering at the edges. In the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, Labor's revised solution is to give every politician and billionaire $4½ thousand a year whilst giving middle-income earners just $15 a week. Three times as much is still going to those at the top as to those in the middle, and those at the bottom get nothing. Labor can find $4½ thousand a year for politicians but only $15 a week for people whose rent has gone up by $100 or whose mortgage has gone up by $200. It does not add up. Under Labor's package, the wealthiest 20 per cent of people will get half the $318 billion that these stage 3 revised tax cuts will cost the public purse. The poorest 20 per cent of people will get 0.4 per cent of that money. And that's Labor's idea of fairness? That's your idea of leaving no-one behind?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has audaciously packaged their reforms to the stage 3 tax cuts as a win for women, when in reality they will still exacerbate the gender pay gap. The previous stage 3 tax cuts had twice the benefit going to men as to women. Under these revised stage 3 tax cuts, 58 per cent will go to men, with just 41½ per cent going to women. So these tax cuts are still skewed towards men—and wealthy men, at that—even though there has been a slight improvement on those figures when compared with Mr Morrison's version.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Press Club, when announcing the revised stage 3 tax cuts, the Prime Minister said, 'no-one held back and no-one left behind'. I think the Prime Minister must have forgotten about all those people who earn below the $18,000 tax-free threshold. I think he must have forgotten about those people who are out of the workforce because of caring responsibilities. He definitely forgot about people on income support. Those people get nothing to deal with this most pernicious cost-of-living crisis. Those people who need the help the most, who are struggling the most, are getting absolutely nothing out of this $318 billion spend of public money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of funding tax cuts, Labor could have put that money into services that would benefit everyone and that would actually lower the cost of living for everyone: building more public homes, getting dental and mental health care into Medicare, freezing rents and mortgages, wiping student debt, fully funding the NDIS, and making child care free. That's the sort of investment that $318 billion of public money could have actually delivered in benefits to ordinary people—universal services. The revised stage 3 tax cuts will starve the budget by that jaw-dropping $318 billion over the decade. So, whenever the Treasurer says, 'We can't afford things like putting superannuation onto paid parental leave,' it is because the cost of these tax cuts makes everything unaffordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a farce. Labor has shifted on the stage 3 tax cuts because they finally could not deny anymore that they were unfair. When circumstances change, so should a policy position. Well, the housing crisis has changed, too. If Labor can shift on the stage 3 tax cuts, they should shift on negative gearing and on the massive tax handouts that go to property investors. All those property investor tax handouts do—those billions of dollars of public money every year—is to push house prices further out of reach for renters and first home buyers. They should be scrapped. We've seen that pressure works, and the Greens will keep applying the pressure on the government to scrap those property investor tax handouts to the wealthy that are making the housing crisis worse and making unaffordability very, very real for more and more people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The LNP and the media want to talk about broken promises on the stage 3 tax cuts. Well, the broken promise that should be being talked about is the one Mr Albanese made when he said no-one would be left behind. The revised stage 3 tax cuts are still leaving far too many people behind: $4½ thousand a year for politicians but only $15 a week for middle income earners, whose rent has gone up by 100 bucks or whose mortgage has gone up by 200. That's not fairness. That's asking people to continue to suffer through a cost-of-living crisis. That's ignoring the most needy and wasting billions on the rich, who don't need a tax cut, when that money could be used to fund universal services that could help everyone: things like making university free again, making early childhood education genuinely free for all, scrapping the student debt that hangs over so many students' heads and often gets worse every year because of compound interest, spending money building more public homes so we can finally address the housing crisis in this country, and putting dental and mental care into Medicare. There are so many things that $318 billion—particularly the portion that's allocated to those who earn over $200,000, who don't need the help—could be spent on that would genuinely help people and provide those universal services to everyone who needs them. Yet this government, because they lack courage, have made the smallest of tweaks and are now trying to pour glory on themselves because they've made this small change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a welcome change, but they should have scrapped these tax cuts entirely and funded universal services. So much for 'no-one left behind'. I foreshadow that I'll be moving a second reading amendment in relation to the conduct of this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  I will be speaking on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia and particularly the taxpayers of Queensland. And it's always nice to hear contributions from members of the Greens party, who have an approach to economics which could only be described as confetti economics, which is that they waltz and skip and dance around the highways and byways of our country with their confetti guns, flicking out bits of paper and making outrageous promises and wanting to spend all sorts of money—</span>

                    </a>  It would not be recycled paper. It would be coloured paper, probably imported from overseas. What the Greens and those on the left of Australian politics fail to realise is that, with all these promises they want to make—to make them feel good and to enable them to do lots of virtue-signalling—someone's got to pay for it, and it's the taxpayers of Australia who have got to pay for it. I, as a senator for Queensland, and the Liberal and National parties are on the side of the taxpayers, because we believe that taxpayers know best how their money should be spent. We believe in lowering taxes because we believe that the taxpayers, with that money in their pocket, their purse, their wallet or their hand, are better judges of how that money should be spent than bureaucrats or politicians in Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will always support the lowering of taxes. We should lower taxes because it's good for the economy. It's good for families. It's good for jobs. But what disappoints me is that we have a prime minister in this country who has knowingly and repeatedly misled the Australian people in relation to the stage 3 tax cuts. What this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the associated legislation comes down to, in a way, is not the tax cuts themselves, as important as they are; it goes to the virtue of the Prime Minister of this country. The Prime Minister of this country promised Australians they could trust him. He said, 'My word is my bond.' That is what he said. He broke that bond. He broke that promise. That's not the only promise he has broken. We may recall that the Prime Minister and members of the Labor Party promised 97 times before the last election that they would cut your electricity bills by $275. Put your hands up if your power bill has gone down by $275. No-one is putting their hand up because power bills have not gone down by $275; they've gone up by 10, 15 or 20 per cent since Labor came into power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen with this Prime Minister, whether it's the broken promise over power bills or the broken promise over stage 3 tax cuts, is a preparedness to do anything and say anything to save his political skin. These stage 3 tax cuts have not come ahead because Prime Minister Albanese, after spending almost 30 years in this place, has decided that he believes in lowering taxes and has joined the IPA or the HR Nicholls Society and decided that economic reform is something that would be great for Australians. What has happened is that there's a by-election being held in Victoria in the seat of Dunkley.</span>

                    </a>  The polling wasn't good, Senator Scarr, and, as Senator Smith said, politics has come into this. The stage 3 tax cuts have come in because Labor have suddenly realised there's a cost-of-living crisis in this country. This cost-of-living crisis is hurting Australian families, hurting Australian businesses and hurting Australians, but we have a prime minister who's very happy to go to concerts or the tennis and to flit around this country like a social butterfly but was not prepared to understand the impacts of this cost-of-living crisis until the Labor Party went to him with some research and said, 'Prime Minister, mate, you've got to do something about this cost-of-living crisis because we've got a by-election coming up and we are in danger of losing this by-election.' Hence, they've brought forward the changes to the stage 3 tax reforms. Hence, the Prime Minister has again broken his word to the Australian people. He will do everything and say anything to keep his feet in the Lodge.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Before Prime Minister Anthony Albanese joined thousands of his New South Wales electors at the Taylor Swift concert, he had a moment to drop in on Western Australia. In the 48 hours that he spent in Western Australia, he left more questions than he was able to provide answers for. Western Australians were left wondering: why is this Labor Prime Minister damaging the agricultural sector by continuing the ban on live exports, an industry that is worth $120 million to regional communities across Western Australia? Western Australians were left wondering: why is this Labor government's unmodelled, unplanned immigration policy hurting Western Australians? Western Australians' rents have peaked at $600 a week, and we know that first home buyers have fallen from 2,600 when the Coalition was in government to just 1,000 last year. Western Australians are wondering: Prime Minister, why don't you listen to our concerns when you come to our state?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They all know in Western Australia that our wealth, which is shared with the whole country, is built on agriculture and mining, but this government wants to fund the Environmental Defenders Office that is going to harm and damage Western Australian mining interests. They know that this government is not interested in farming communities across regional Western Australia. On top of that, they know they are experiencing the worst cost-of-living crisis they have ever experienced. This Prime Minister comes to Western Australia with no answers and just leaves people with more questions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  On Thursday of last week, I had the privilege of speaking at the<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Mandarin</span> conference on rebuilding trust in the Public Service. The Public Service is important to me and to the Australian people as so many of us rely on it for the delivery of essential services that keep our nation functioning. Public servants are crucial to our national security and our democratic reality. They're crucial to health, education, agriculture and the environment, to name just a few key areas. That's why it's so important that the government continue its efforts to bring core government responsibilities back in-house to the Public Service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Progress to that end is being made. It was reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> yesterday, in an article by Matt Bell entitled 'Big four denied federal contracts', that Australia's four big consulting firms—EY, KPMG, Deloitte and PwC—have seen the value of contracts awarded to them by the government of the Commonwealth fall in value by almost half. This has coincided, I'm very pleased to say, with more than 3,000 labour hire and external workers being converted into full-time APS employees, serving their nation with pride and integrity in a stable, safe and secure job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not to say that there's no place for external consultancies. Experts should remain key to service delivery, particularly when their function is a non-ongoing, non-core APS service. I know of many small to medium sized enterprises in Australia who help provide key insights in their area of expertise to the Australian Public Service, and I congratulate them. The system must be populated with people who are going to serve the interests of Australia, not be replete with conflicts of interest.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  At the recent estimates hearings, Services Australia had to—shockingly—admit that there are more than 1.1 million outstanding income support payment claims. They also admitted that it is still painfully difficult to contact Centrelink. Only 50 per cent of calls made to Centrelink in the last six months were answered. One in six calls were met with congestion messaging, which means that people didn't even get a chance to talk to someone, and almost a quarter of people had to wait longer than an hour to get through to someone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite Labor's commitment to leave no-one behind, since Labor has been in government Services Australia's performance has got worse. These are not just statistics. Each number reflects the lives of Australians who rely on the government to provide them with the support they need. Those 1.1 million claims mean that around a million people are waiting for crucial assistance. Many of these people have illnesses, injuries or disabilities that prevent them from working, and they depend upon income support to survive. The social security system is meant to be their lifeline—their safety net.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to these appalling statistics, all Services Australia officials could do was apologise and, while an apology is long overdue and appreciated, it is, frankly, not good enough. Services Australia needs urgent and significantly increased resourcing. Their staff are doing the best they can in the circumstances, but there aren't enough of them. Labor must properly fund the agency to ensure people can access the support they need, and they must also immediately increase the rate of all income support payments to above the poverty line and abolish all punitive measures in our social security system. Poverty is a political choice, and Labor is choosing to keep people in poverty and to keep our income support system broken.</span>

Over the past 12 months, there has been a staggering fall in the number of GP medical clinics offering bulk-billing. Over the course of 2023, 400 clinics have ceased offering bulk-billing to new adult patients.</span>

Reflect on that: in my local region, the Greater Ipswich region in Queensland, there has been a fall of 36 per cent during the course of 2023 in the number of medical clinics offering bulk-billing. Disturbingly, this report now indicates that 1.2 million Australians are either not going to see their GP when they should or they are deferring GP visits because of the cost-of-living crisis. Ipswich residents should not have to make a choice, during this Albanese cost-of-living crisis, between seeing their GP and putting food on the table for their family.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Community television in South Australia and Victoria plays a fundamental role in our media landscape. During the pandemic it was there for South Australians, providing content, particularly religious services in language, meaning that communities in Adelaide and across South Australia and Victoria had access to this vital form of community connection when they were no longer able to attend services and no longer able to connect with their communities in person.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In so many ways, community television reflects our local community in South Australia and the local community in Victoria. It provides opportunities and platforms for volunteers to learn their skills, develop and grow. It covers all the major events in South Australia. Community television is there for us in the difficult times, but it's also there to celebrate everything which is good about South Australia and Victoria.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I fought so hard for community television when the former coalition government cruelly sought to kick it off air, despite it not costing them a single cent to allow them to continue broadcasting in Victoria and South Australia and despite their not having any other use for the part of the spectrum that community television occupies. It was an ideological attack on community television from a political party which just didn't get or value its contribution to our communities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased to say that the Albanese Labor government is introducing legislation in the other place which will give community television security and transparency in the future. That is all they have been asking for—the ability to continue the amazing community based work and service that they provide in South Australia and Victoria. I am a huge supporter of all that they do, and I am pleased that under our government we will end these crazy ideological attacks and give them the security that they deserve.</span>

I observed that one of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's first orders of business was a private meeting with globalist billionaire and manipulator extraordinaire Bill Gates. I spoke to a more recent meeting the Prime Minister had with Larry Fink, the chairman of BlackRock, the merchant bank that now owns Australia and tries to control Australia. In the break, the Prime Minister once again used taxpayers' money and a taxpayers' plane to hobnob at concerts, exhibition openings and attend a billionaire's birthday soiree. In so doing, the Prime Minister has demonstrated that he will kiss the ring of any elites he needs in order to keep swanning around as though the weight of responsibility—</span>

His latest policy is a tax on commercial vehicles, including utes that tradies need to be a tradie. How can a so-called party of working Australians introduce a ute tax that will make it harder for tradies to own what is an essential tool of their trade? Have you considered what that tax would do to housing construction? It will cut house production and raise house costs. If ever the analogy of fiddling while Rome burns is appropriate to a modern leader, it's now. It's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. What a disgrace!</span>

This shocked me. It shocked me because I'd checked the forecast the day before, and the Bureau of Meteorology hadn't forecast any rain. It's just another example of the many failed forecasts that the bureau has made throughout this summer. Originally, it forecast that it would be dry, and it has been an extremely wet summer in Queensland, unfortunately to the detriment of many Queenslanders who've been caught on the hop by a bureau that is no longer focused on doing its job properly and forecasting weather. That is because for far too long they have been spending way too much money on the climate division and not on the weather division.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  The Australian Labor Party, through the Albanese Labor government, is delivering tax cuts for hardworking Tasmanians. From Swansea to Smithton, Tasmanians will get to keep more of what they earn under Labor's fair and timely reforms. The cost-of-living crisis is impacting across Tasmania. Labor's tax cuts will help boost Tasmania's economy and give taxpayers more money to cover rent, more money to cover child care and more money to cover medical expenses. They will ensure middle-income Australians will get ahead. Those who are aspirational will get more out of these tax cuts, with 84 per cent of all Australian workers getting a tax cut. We have always looked out for Tasmanians. The Labor Party has always stood for fairness, and Labor's tax reforms will deliver fairer tax by addressing bracket creep.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's tax reforms are fair because they will impact at all stages of life. They will help young workers at the start of their careers, young parents and people in their 30s and 40s. More senior working Australians will also benefit from these tax cuts. Labor's tax cuts will help women in every city and town right across this country, including in my home state of Tasmania. Under Labor's tax reforms, Tasmanian teachers, tradies, retail workers and hospitality workers will all keep more of what they earn. The people who work hard every day to provide for their families will get an average tax cut of $1,500 a year. That is $1,500 towards their rent, towards education or towards groceries. It's tax relief for Tasmanians at a time when they really need it. It is tax relief that is based on fairness and that will deliver better outcomes for all Tasmanians. I'm proud of the Albanese Labor government's tax reforms.</span>

You have to ask yourself: why is Eric Abetz making a comeback? Is it because he wants to continue to prosecute the culture wars he prosecuted in this place? Is it because of his passion and full-throated support for the logging of Tasmania's wild places? Is it because he wants revenge on some of his colleagues?

I recognise that peace in the Middle East is a very important issue, but let's be honest; neither Hamas nor the Israeli government is awaiting instruction from the Melbourne City Council.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month a survey found that 80 per cent of ratepayers were—get this—dissatisfied with the performance of their local council. The overwhelming majority wanted their counsellors to focus on—guess what?—filling potholes, emptying the bins and keeping the parks tidy. Geopolitics and issues like climate change, Indigenous reconciliation, 'LGBTQI minus-sign, divided-by sign, exclamation mark' rights were at the very bottom of the list of ratepayer priorities. A big problem in our country is that too many local councils are controlled by—guess who?—activists. They run for local government not to serve the community but to leverage their position and agitate for their woke ideologies. This results in one thing: local councils that refuse to divide the landfill from the recyclables but who are experts at dividing the community according to ethnic, sexuality, gender and any other number of identity groups that they like to bang on about. Councils—stay in your lane: roads, rates and rubbish. You communists!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  More than a year ago, alcohol bans in the Northern Territory lapsed and brought crime and terror to the streets of towns like my hometown of Alice Springs. The footage has been seen far and wide across the country—brawls, assaults, reckless driving, break-ins and attacks—and two weeks ago we found out that, in a clear conflict of interest, Labor's Deputy Chief Minister, Chansey Paech, advocated for the end of alcohol bans while he held shares in Metcash, a wholesale distribution company that supplies alcohol throughout Central Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With absolutely no regard for the entirely foreseeable consequences and problems it would cause in communities, Chansey Paech used his position to fight for a decision that he would benefit from. The Deputy Chief Minister seems to believe he is untouchable. He believes he doesn't need to be accountable for his actions. He refuses to take responsibility for his actions and has treated the people of the Northern Territory with nothing but contempt. He purchased those shares just two months prior to arguing to lift the alcohol restrictions he actively fought for the restrictions to be removed. He is morally bankrupt. His actions contributed to the absolute destruction that we have seen on the streets of Alice Springs and across the Northern Territory. I don't care how much the shares cost or how much they're worth—it is his responsibility to the people of the Northern Territory and to our most marginalised. He failed them. He should accept responsibility and resign.</span>

We will lose it because of bureaucracy and red tape. The government delivered on my request for documents relating to the Launceston City Deal and, in particular, projects under the Department of Defence, and boy those pages are an entertaining read—all 4,000 of them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're still chipping away at them—there's a lot to get through—but when it comes to the proposed land transfer to the North Launceston cadet facility, the pages tell a story of UTAS being uncooperative and causing unnecessary delays. Emails and letters show frustrations at UTAS changing their position on the deal several times. One email even says that UTAS has made 'unreasonable attempts to leverage the circumstances'.</span>

The government are halfway through their term in government, and they haven't been delivering for the people of Launceston. The Launceston community deserves more than this bumbling bureaucracy. We deserve to have the projects that have been promised—preferably quicker than in seven years.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  Treaty is off the table yet again and very few people have realised it, as this government is doing its best to cover up what is quickly becoming one of the biggest broken promises to First Peoples this country has seen. It's 36 years since a prime minister made a commitment to treaty, yet we have nothing to show for it. First it was Hawke, then it was Keating, and now Albanese has made it a trifecta of Labor prime ministers failing to fulfil their commitments to treaty.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Albanese government was elected, it committed to implementing the Statement from the Heart in full. When we voted in the referendum last year, we were not told that the promise of truth and treaty was dependent on the Voice. Four months later, our people are still hurting. We need healing, yet instead the government pours salt into our wounds. In estimates last week, the government made it clear that truth and treaty are off the table. This decision was made within the Labor Party, and they have even called these conversations amongst themselves 'consultation'. Talk about ignoring grassroots voices, not to mention the calls from thousands of people who attended rallies on 26 January to demand truth and treaty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year offers an opportunity to begin a process of healing, following your failed referendum, and a renewed approach to truth-telling. The government has $22 million sitting in a reserve fund for makarrata. It is time for the government to get out of the way and spend this money on truth and treaty through a self-determined grassroots process to heal this nation.</span>

Two years ago, war returned to Europe—a brutal, bloody type of war, the likes of which we had thought and hoped belonged in the last century. But, as Russia's tanks and troops sought to roll across the border in their illegal, immoral and abominable invasion, we have seen a return to that type of conflict. It was an unprovoked, unjust and unacceptable attack on Ukraine. It was a reminder that the days of despots and autocrats are not gone; in fact, we face the threats more, potentially, than for many, many years.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Putin expected a quick victory, but he miscalculated. On this second anniversary we salute the unwavering strength of Ukrainians, which has kept the belligerent advances of Russia at bay. We also pay tribute to those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. Lest we forget the tens of thousands who have lost their lives and the many more who have suffered injuries and the loss of income, property, wellbeing and basic humanity.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Within two months of Russia's invasion the former coalition government delivered a comprehensive package of support for Ukraine—military assistance, economic assistance, energy assistance, and support through visas. We were comprehensive in our support. We positioned Australia as a leading non-NATO contributor. Whilst the Albanese government has provided further assistance, it has slipped relative to that of other nations. We call on the Albanese government to reverse their decision and donate Australia's out-of-service MRH-90 Taipan helicopters to Ukraine, to reinstate an Australian embassy in Kyiv, to respond to repeated requests from Ukraine for additional energy support and to ensure the swift finalisation of a double taxation agreement alongside comprehensive support.</span>

They were so rapt and they wanted to have first bragging rights because of all the work they had been doing around this building, lobbying for transport reform in the closing the loopholes bill. They were so rapt, and they wanted me to personally thank the government senators, the Greens senators and the crossbenchers Senator Pocock and Senator Thorpe. But I wanted to pay my respects to outgoing president Rod Hannifey—I'm just looking at the clock, and that's not right, is it? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

On 16 February, the Australian Border Force issued a media release entitled 'ABF operation in Western Australia' in response to media reports that at least one illegal venture had arrived near Beagle Bay. Ministers have since publicly acknowledged the arrival of a vessel. Will the minister confirm when this illegal venture arrived, how many boats there were and how many illegal maritime arrivals were on board?</span>

We won't be commenting on operational matters or seeking to politicise national security and border protection, unlike those opposite. We're not going to assist the people-smuggling business. We have a large border, as everyone knows, so boat arrivals do happen from time to time, and we saw that under your government, Senator Paterson. We had a very similar situation to what recently occurred in WA, in Queensland.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The mission of Operation Sovereign Borders remains the same today as … when it was established in 2013: protect Australian borders, combat people smuggling in our region, and importantly, prevent people from risking their lives at sea. Any alternate narrative will be exploited by criminal people smugglers to deceive potential irregular immigrants and convince them to risk their lives and travel to Australia by boat.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Finance, Minister for Women, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:07</span>):  I thank Senator Sheldon for the question and acknowledge his career in advocating for working people across this country and ensuring that they get fair wages for the work that they do. We said we would get wages moving again and we are. Real wages growth is back and ahead of schedule, because the Albanese government wants people to earn more and keep more of what they earn.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Annual real wages growth increased at the end of last year for the first time in almost three years and, for the first time since 2018, we've seen three consecutive quarters of real wages growth. Since the election, nominal wages have been growing at an annualised average of four per cent, compared to 2.2 per cent under the Liberal government. This is a substantial turnaround in just 18 months. It means that real wages growth returned faster than forecast by Treasury—at the end of 2023, rather than at the beginning of 2024. Stronger wages growth is a result of the government's policies to lift wages for workers, including our support for record increases to the minimum wage, which has increased by $110 a week under Labor; a 5.75 per cent pay rise for workers on awards in 2023 and 4.6 per cent in 2022; the highest-ever pay rise for aged-care workers, who had long argued the case for better wages—a 15 per cent wage increase, and it took a Labor government to deliver that; and significant investments in new industries to create secure, well-paid jobs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are improving job security and pay equity for Australian women, and the gender pay gap has fallen to a record low of 12 per cent. Last week's new numbers are very welcome, but we know that people are still under pressure, which is why Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts will be so important when they pass the Senate later this week.</span>

Labor's tax cuts will deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer. That's 13.6 million people. Labor's tax cut will deliver a bigger tax cut for Middle Australia to help with the cost of living. This builds on our other measures to target cost-of-living relief while not adding to inflation. Despite opposition from the Liberals and Nationals, we've already delivered electricity bill relief. We've made medicines cheaper. We're making it easier and cheaper to see a doctor. There's cheaper child care. We're expanding parental leave. We're building more social and affordable homes and we're increasing rent assistance. There's fee-free TAFE. All of these measures have received opposition from those opposite.</span>

For too long, under the former government, workers weren't getting a fair wage increase. We saw wages stagnate. We saw annual wages growth of around two per cent. In the public sector it was in the order of about 1.2 per cent over the decade, so they were falling behind.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've done in our first 18 months is support those cost-of-living measures which don't add to inflation, but we've also put in place the architecture to make sure that workers are getting a fair pay rise. Our cost-of-living policies have helped to deliver that sooner because our policies have helped put downward pressure on inflation, and we saw that in the ABS data. Because we're putting downward pressure on inflation, we've seen those good wage figures in the last week. But we know people are under pressure, which is why we remain focused on the job at hand, which is to ease cost-of-living pressures on the Australian community.</span>

At Senate estimates earlier this month, the Department of Home Affairs gave evidence that at least 18 individuals released from immigration detention as a result of the NZYQ High Court decision have been charged by state and territory police and that at least seven individuals have been charged for breaching their visa conditions. How many of the 149 noncitizens released from immigration detention as a result of the NZYQ case are currently in custody?</span>

The High Court ruled that indefinite detention was unconstitutional, and it up-ended two decades of legal precedent. This opposition has taken every single opportunity to play politics with this issue as we have gotten on, have focused on keeping the community safe and have focused on putting in place arrangements to keep monitoring and keep an eye on those who have been released.</span>

The officials—our police who are in charge, our Home Affairs staff who are in charge—are doing the job that we have asked them to do, as they should do. They are the experts. They are in charge. They are managing this situation. They are keeping the government briefed. They are providing information where it is required. And you've just had a whole week of estimates to investigate this yourself, where you were given a range of evidence. But I am very confident that the AFP and the ABF, along with their state and territory counterparts, are doing the job that they need to do, keeping the community safe. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I can confirm that the ABF and the AFP are doing everything that we have asked them to do, in the laws that have passed this place, to keep the community safe. As I would remind those opposite, it took, I think, three years, under HRTO, to put a case before the courts—a successful case. The officials will do the work that they need to do.

Under HRTO it took more than three years for the first continuing detention order application.

Two weeks ago the Minister for Resources introduced a bill that would give the minister the power to bypass environment laws to fast-track climate-destroying gas projects and silence First Nations voices under the guise of worker safety. Why is this government's first legislative act since the Voice referendum to silence the voice of First Nations communities who oppose gas projects in their land and sea country?</span>

The short answer is no. And of course that's a ridiculous proposition that is being put. As I said, the bill before the parliament does not change the legal requirements for consultation for offshore projects in any way, shape or form. There'll be no change to rigorous environmental assessments. No environmental standards will be watered down. There will be no fast track for offshore projects. And the government is consulting on ways to make these consultation processes clearer for offshore resources projects. Indeed, the consultation period has been extended to ensure that everyone can have their say. Environmental organisations, First Nations groups, industry and resources companies have all told us that our system of consultation about projects is not working. So we are happy to work with stakeholders on sensible amendments to the current bill to give everyone further confidence about the intent of the changes.</span>

This government supports the resources industry and the jobs that it creates and the export dollars it creates. We think we can do it in a way that respects First Nations interests and the environmental interests at stake here as well.</span>

The short answer to your question is we are doing plenty on these matters. Unlike the opposition, the Albanese government wants Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn. We're not about reducing how much people get paid and making them pay more tax, like the opposition; we're about helping Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July, as a result of the Albanese government's changes, Australian workers will be able to keep more of what they earn with Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts. Every single taxpayer in Australia will get a tax cut, different to what the Liberals and the Nationals put forward, and Middle Australia and low-income earners will get a significantly higher tax cut than they were going to get under the Morrison-Dutton tax cuts. We're also helping workers to earn more by boosting job security and wage bargaining, strengthening our awards system and closing loopholes that undercut pay and conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Green is right: low wages were a deliberate design feature of LNP economic policy, and they had the desired effect for the LNP by keeping wages down year after year. According to data released by the ABS last week, under the Albanese government real wages growth is back and ahead of schedule. Wages were 4.2 per cent higher through the year, the equal fastest annual growth since 2009. It took a Labor government, the Albanese Labor government, to see real wages growth returning to Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the first time since 2018 we've seen three consecutive quarters of real wages growth, and the highest wage growth in health care and social assistance industry in the history of the wage price index—double the average wage growth under those opposite for nine years. Two-thirds of wage growth in the most recent quarter came from awards and enterprise bargaining—the direct result of actions taken by this government. Think back to the legislation we passed: the 'secure jobs, better pay' bill, the 'closing the loopholes' bill—both opposed by the opposition, both put forward by Labor and both delivering for Australian workers. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We understand very well that Australians are dealing with cost-of-living pressures at the moment and that, despite the various things our government is doing, people still need help. That's exactly why we are working so hard to get wages moving again and delivering Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts. I'm really pleased to see that our policies are starting to pay off, with the strongest annual wage growth in over 14 years under the Albanese Labor government. The average full-time worker now earns $120 a week more since we came to government, and, under Labor's tax cuts plan, they will get a tax cut of more than $2,100. Wages have been growing at almost double the average compared with when those opposite were in power. The gender pay gap is at 12 per cent, down from 14.1 per cent—the lowest ever level—and this is a direct result of the government's policies to lift wages for workers, including fixing our bargaining system, banning pay-secrecy clauses, and fixing gender-equality and job-security objectives of awards in the Fair Work Act.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:31</span>):  My question is to the minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water, Senator Gallagher. Last week the Minister for the Environment and Water, Tania Plibersek MP, stated that Australians were throwing out too many items of clothing and that manufacturers should sign up to a government-backed scheme called Seamless to recycle and not dump used clothes. Clothing can and should be recycled into new clothing and other fibre products.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Australian company operates an upcycling scheme that has dozens of manufacturers, trade linen suppliers, recycling companies and retailers as members, and has taken 100 tonnes of clothing out of landfill. Minister, why is the government reinventing the wheel, creating its own favoured solution and imposing that, instead of working with the industry to help them upscale their existing solution?</span>

That has been critical to the work that she has been doing and it has certainly been under way for some time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there was talk before there was a summit and that there was talk of a voluntary code, but it's an important part of ensuring that we're protecting the environment from the amount of waste that's going into landfill. A big contributor to that is clothing. I don't know, maybe I have misunderstood your question, Senator Roberts, but while there are manufacturers and industries in place that are already doing this, this is about building on that and making it more across-the-board, particularly for those that aren't doing that, to make sure we're lifting our game in relation to recycling and preventing the huge amount of clothing material going into landfill. If there are manufacturers or businesses that you think are feeling out of the loop of that consultation I'm sure the Minister for the Environment and Water would be happy to reach out.</span>

Most suggest giving used clothes to charity shops, very little of which can be resold. Most of that ends up in landfill at the charity shop's expense. Isn't the first step here sorting out the system for recycling and processing, then working with councils and retailers to encourage recycling through yellow bins? Is your government putting the cart before the horse?</span>

Where we can, we do work with councils and we work with businesses—we'll work with anybody who wants to help protect the environment and reduce the amount of waste going to landfill. From my reading—and I was not here last week—of the work that Minister Plibersek was doing, it was about encouraging the voluntary cooperation or involvement of businesses in Seamless, in that program, to build it from there.</span>

We are seeing that the average Australian sends almost 10 kilos of clothing waste to landfill every year. So it is a big problem, and it's a problem that we need to work across industry to fix.</span>

The agreement between the Victorian, Tasmanian and Commonwealth governments to deliver the Marinus Link has included an option for the Tasmanian government to sell their share of the project to the Commonwealth since September last year, which has been public.

The Commonwealth government has an agreement in place with the Victorian and Tasmanian governments. There is an option for the Tasmanian government to sell their share of the project to the Commonwealth but only once the first cable of Marinus is fully operational. I don't think it's useful for us to get involved in state campaigns. They'll no doubt traverse a range of issues. The Marinus Link is a project we are committed to, it's going ahead, and of course we will work with whatever government forms government in Tasmania when that election is complete.</span>

In the lead-up to the last election, the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, made the strongest possible election commitment to stopping petroleum exploration project 11, known as PEP-11, from proceeding off the New South Wales coast. Earlier this month, the New South Wales government announced its plan to stop PEP-11 in its state waters. I understand that the PEP-11 proposal is now with a joint Commonwealth-state authority. Can you confirm today that Minister King has the final say on the future of PEP-11, and can you tell coastal communities across New South Wales, who want this project stopped, when this decision will be made?</span>

I do recall the commitment that the Prime Minister made and Labor made, prior to the election, on an issue that I know is of great significance in that part of Australia. Since coming to office, the government has been left with no choice but to concede that Mr Morrison's actions on PEP-11 could not be defended in court, so the government is taking a different approach by governing with competency and in the national interest.</span>

I understand that the New South Wales bill does not ban PEP-11, which is in Commonwealth waters rather than New South Wales coastal waters. So the New South Wales bill, as I say, relates only to offshore resources activity in New South Wales coastal waters. In terms of that bill, it's obviously a matter for the New South Wales government, and I refer you to them about this point. But we do understand—</span>

As you say, Senator Whish-Wilson, the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator finalised advice on PEP-11 for the New South Wales government and the Australian government on 18 October 2023. Departments are now reviewing this advice, as is appropriate. Any future decision on PEP-11 would first need to be considered by the government of New South Wales as a member of the Commonwealth-New South Wales offshore petroleum joint authority. A future decision on PEP-11 will only be considered by the Australian government once the New South Wales government minister has considered NOPTA's advice and made a formal decision on PEP-11, but it's not the government's intention to provide an ongoing commentary on PEP-11.</span>

The government very much understands the concerns of many in the local community about this particular project, and that's why we took the position that we did. But it's not my intention to jeopardise an administrative decision, which is yet to be made, by speculating about what may or may not happen and what decision may or may not be made. I've said repeatedly in answer to your questions that NOPTA has finalised its advice for both the New South Wales and Australian governments. That advice is now being considered by the relevant departments. For me to speculate on what the outcome of that might be would be risky and would potentially create avenues for legal action, which we don't want to provide. We want to make this decision properly, in accordance with the law and in accordance with good process, and I have no doubt that a decision will be made as soon as possible.</span>

Last week the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported a further reduction in the gender pay gap, to 12 per cent, delivering the smallest pay gap based on gender on record, a testament to the Albanese government's commitment to women's equality. This achievement comes alongside significant strides in workplace reform and gender equity and demonstrates how the government's policies for women are putting downward pressure on the gender pay gap. Could the minister please outline how these initiatives contribute to the government's broader economic and social goals?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, the gender pay gap has dropped to a record low, with the ABS reporting last week that the gender pay gap has dropped to 12 per cent. The ABS identified that the reduction is driven by broad based wages growth, which has been particularly strong for women. The WPI rose by 4.2 per cent in the year to the December quarter of 2023. This was the highest annual increase in underlying wages growth since the March quarter of 2009. This shows that our efforts to lift wages are working and that our efforts to support women's economic equality are working in a very real and tangible way, and that is because women's economic equality has been a key priority of our government since day one. We have recognised that women's economic equality is a core economic priority. We've been working hard to implement reforms that'll have a real, practical impact on the lives of Australian women.</span>

This is on top of the reforms we've made to the industrial relations system, reforms the opposition opposed, of course; reforms to fix the bargaining system to get wages moving, particularly in industries dominated by women workers; reforms to change the law to put gender equity at the heart of the Fair Work Commission's decision-making; and reforms to ban pay secrecy clauses to reduce gender pay discrimination.

We've been working hard to improve economic outcomes for women. While there is still a lot of work to do, we are seeing welcome improvements. Women are not only benefiting from record wages growth, but also women's workforce participation reached a record high of 63 per cent in November. There were 333,000 more women employed in January than there were in May 2022, a 5.2 per cent increase. This means more women are earning, and, with the narrowing pay gap, their work is being better valued. We're also investing directly to close those gaps through supporting increasing the minimum wage and funding pay rises in industries like aged care. With Labor's tax cuts, 100 per cent of working women will get a tax cut, and 90 per cent of women will be better off than they would have been under former prime minister Morrison's tax plan.</span>

It is an important publication of data tomorrow by WGEA—the first time that gender pay gaps of employers with 100 or more employees will be published. I acknowledge the huge amount of work that has gone in from WGEA, from all the staff, led by Ms Mary Wooldridge. They have done an incredible job to put us in the position where that data will be released tomorrow. Data is a powerful tool for accountability and change. This is not, I think, about concentrating on where the gap is the biggest; it's about making sure that all businesses, where they can, are making efforts to close the gender pay gap, that they're understanding what's happening in their business and that we are using all the levers available to us to make gender equality, certainly when it comes to pay but also in other areas, a real opportunity in Australia.</span>

I refer to a media report and a statement issued by the Department of Finance on 21 February 2024 regarding the department's inappropriate disclosure of the commercially sensitive pricing information for up to 400 businesses. Recent reports from InnovationAus.com claim that up to 200 of these impacted businesses have yet to sign any confidentiality agreement to prevent the disclosure of pricing information. Minister, when were you informed that this disclosure had occurred?</span>

This is a really disappointing issue. Commercially sensitive information from the MAS Panel has again been inadvertently disclosed by the Department of Finance in an administrative error. I would have to check the date, but it was around 19 or 20 February that I was advised, and Finance had certainly been in touch with my office. I was travelling last week, so I would just have to check that. I think on 21 February the secretary issued a statement on the disclosure of information, and I think the next day the secretary also announced a review into how these two MAS Panel disclosures have occurred.</span>

I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I understand that there were a number where the email hadn't been opened and the email was deleted after contact by the Department of Finance. But I can tell you that the department is doing everything it can to ensure that we minimise the impact on suppliers and certainly that this never happens again. I would also say that there is work being done to support staff that have been involved in this, and the inquiry will get to the bottom of what has led to the error in disclosure of this sensitive information.</span>

                  </a>  Yes, there have been two inappropriate disclosures on the MAS Panel, as I recall it. I had a number of discussions with the secretary of Finance. Ms Wilkinson did a lot of work with the relevant area. They're dealing with these matters all the time. I was confident in my briefings with the department and with the internal investigation that was conducted that steps had been taken to make sure this wouldn't happen again. Obviously it has. That's why the inquiry by Mr Manthorpe is so important. I don't want to get ahead of that, so we'll wait for that inquiry to be held. I understand that it's only going to be a matter of weeks. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be a bad day to be a member of the state Labor team in Tasmania, when you're hung out to dry by the Australian Labor Party in the form of the Albanese government. Today we read in the paper that, if elected, the new Labor government would tear up Marinus Link. For those listening, I will tell you about Marinus Link. It's a project which was first envisaged by the former coalition government around the need to generate more clean energy. Of course it is this crew opposite—the government, who sometimes don't act like a government, if you judge them on their behaviour in this place—who are all about clean, green energy. Marinus Link and the Battery of the Nation are two projects which I would have thought the Australian Labor Party and the Albanese government would be backing, but they are now under threat because of moves by a group of people that want to form government in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll remind senators of what was said by Labor's energy spokesperson in Tasmania just this morning in the Hobart newspaper, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury</span>. Mr Winter, Labor member for Franklin, said, 'Tasmania would be best off getting out of the Marinus project as soon as possible'—not at a later date or at some specified date in the future after the link is fully operational, which is what the minister told us would be the case. He went on to say, 'There's no point throwing good money after bad, at a project where more than 90 per cent of the benefit flows to the mainland.' Mr Winter—this economic whiz, in touch with small business and, of course, the cost-of-living crisis thrust upon us by the Australian Labor Party—is out of touch. He doesn't understand that there are 1,400 jobs directly linked to this project. He's happy to chuck them out the window. Most of them are in regional Tasmania and not in his electorate, so he probably doesn't care. We'll find out one day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, of course, in terms of $1.4 billion of investment from this project alone, it is shameful that, ahead of an election, a candidate seeking to be a minister in a new government would stand up and say: 'You know what? We don't want this. We don't actually want this for Tasmania. We don't want the economic benefits. We don't want to share our clean, green energy to reduce carbon emissions with the Australian mainland.' Meanwhile, this mob over here turn the tap off on other forms of reliable energy generation. It just doesn't make sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But taking note of the answer given by Senator Gallagher, the minister—who I respect greatly; she is a great servant of the people of the ACT—she took issue with me asking a question about Tasmanian issues, which is kind of odd; I am a Tasmanian senator concerned about exactly what's happening down there. But the fact is that Senator Gallagher hung Ms Bec White, the Labor leader in Tasmania, and her shadow energy spokesman out to dry. Their policy is now in tatters. They can't walk away from Marinus Link.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Gallagher confirmed for us today that their policy to walk away from Marinus Link, to tear up this agreement with the Commonwealth, cannot take effect until the first cable is laid and fully operational. It means that that money will have to be spent no matter who is in government—unless the Tasmanian Labor team are lying to the electorate—</span>

                  </a>  Measure my language? Okay. Well then the Tasmanian Labor team are, true to form, misleading every Tasmanian about what they actually stand for. They're still trying to figure it out, of course, because they were caught off guard with this election. They don't know what their policy is, so they've just whipped this one out of the drawer. They're going to tear up Marinus Link, which is good for our energy transition, good for jobs and good for the economy—1,400 jobs and $1.4 billion of economic activity in our state. Mr Winter and Ms White, the brains trust of the Tasmanian Labor team, want to tear it all up. But, as was proven today, they can't do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It begs the question: what communication is actually taking place between the Labor Party in Canberra and the Labor Party in Tasmania? I suspect diddly squat—none. Nothing is actually being done in terms of what they are asking from the Australian government. They have no capacity, no leverage, no ability to extract anything out of the Albanese Labor government. You would have thought that, if there was one strong suit that team Labor in Tasmania has, it would be to have the Labor government onside when they're going to announce policies related to federal areas of policy. They didn't. They didn't do their homework. They didn't check. Tasmanians, as I said in the question, will be worse off. They'll be paying more for electricity under Labor. There'll be fewer jobs. There'll be less economic activity. And of course the mainland will not be getting the benefit of our clean green power. Labor don't know what they're doing, and I hope to God they don't win the next election.</span>

                  <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  Let's start looking at the record of those on the opposite side and the issues they've been raising through their list of questions over the past week. If we want to talk about protecting Operation Sovereign Borders, let's look at the record of those opposite, at what they've actually done. We won't forget, on that fateful election day, the decision by the previous government, led by the member for Cook, when the operational protocols that protect Operation Sovereign Borders were undermined. Under the direction of the former prime minister and the former home affairs minister, they ordered a senior military officer to issue a public statement compromising a live military led operation. This disregard for Operation Sovereign Borders was not a once-off, of course; it's happened before. They have been up to this before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most recent comments from the Leader of the Opposition on border security have shown yet again that they put their own political games and gains ahead of the country's interests. What they're actually about is marketing to those people who are smuggling people into this country, because that is the consequence of undermining a border protection system that both parties strongly support. They've actually turned around and used a marketing campaign to be used by people smugglers in trying to undermine the exact same policy that we've been implementing. They undermined it on election day. They undermined it when they turned around and made those comments on a live military led operation when dealing with our sovereign borders. They turned around again today, in this last week, doing the exact same thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the opposition isn't here asking questions about the fact they're concerned about boats. They're not here asking questions because they're concerned about protecting Operation Sovereign Borders. They're not here asking questions because they're concerned about national security. They're here asking questions because they want to create fear and division, and also open up the opportunity for those people smugglers to get more people onto boats, dying in the sea lanes all across the territories around Australia. These are the consequences of the strategy that has been adopted by those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the disinformation peddled by the Leader of the Opposition rips apart, for political gain, the bipartisan support for this critical policy. They will stop at nothing, will they? They'll stop at absolutely nothing. And they should absolutely know better than to be carrying on in the way they have, because not only is it false and inaccurate information—and I'll get to that in two moments; I don't think I'm going to have enough time—because what was said by the commander of the Joint Agency Task Force, Operation Sovereign Borders, Rear Admiral Brett Sonter, made it abundantly clear about what those opposite have been up to. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The mission of Operation Sovereign Borders remains the same today as it was when it was established in 2013—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">exactly the same—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">protect Australia's borders, combat people smuggling in our region, and importantly, prevent people from risking their lives at sea</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Any alternate narrative will be exploited by criminal people smugglers to deceive potential irregular immigrants and convince them to risk their lives and travel to Australia by boat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what they're doing. That's what they're up to. And those are the consequences. People will die at sea, if you get your way by giving the sort of misinformation you have, under false pretences, with the false accusations you have made. The facts stand, as the rear admiral expressed. You are undermining our borders and you are putting people at risk. Those are the consequences of what you are doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's another miscalculation, of course, because part of the marketing strategy for these people smugglers is to say that our borders are able to be broken. So what do those opposite do? They not only give misinformation and take a political opportunity to misrepresent the facts; they go further, because they also say that there's been a decrease in funding for the Australian Border Force. So now they're saying to those people smugglers: 'It's easier to come in.' Now, it's the same policy. The rear admiral made it clear—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300134" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CADELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  Continuing on from where Senator Sheldon was, in taking note of similar questions I'll say I was really impressed by the indignation shown by the senator in his speeches. I was really impressed by his ability to bring up past governments and their actions and to use words. But the words of the Labor government are like a Sunday cricketer who goes out and gets bowled for a zack and comes home and hits socials and says, 'Scored a ton!' Their words don't match their actions. They don't in so many things, and they don't here. We hear the words, 'The mission stays the same,' but what about the tools to complete the mission? How are they going? What's under consideration there? And that's how we use our words cleverly in this game. The mission stays the same. But can we do it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what they've done here. Three times today the opportunity was given to the government to talk about how the tools will stay the same to complete the mission and how TPVs, temporary protection visas, will not change and there is no consideration given to them changing—a key element in the deterrence of people smugglers. None of those chances were taken—not one. If you want to talk about who's trying to attract and encourage the people smugglers, why not take the chance—if, as we hear, this bipartisanship on this policy is so strong—to say, 'Yes, that was a great thing that the previous governments did; that will not be changing.' They had three chances today; none of them were taken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've talked about the 149 noncitizens who were released by a High Court ruling—and I agree with that, and we agree with that. We've talked about these dangerous criminals—murderers, rapists and robbers. How many have you applied to be put back into custody? You were given a chance to say how many: 'We've done it for one'—or two or three or four. You would not take the chance. So you stand here being indignant. You bring up past MPs. The past MP that matters is John Howard, the past PM: 'We will determine who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.' That is the core of our national policy. And what we want to see is the tools and the actions and the decisions of government that stay to support that—nothing more than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we see is a 'tough on borders' rhetoric and a 'soft on borders' action. It is like everything this government does. No matter what is happening with our borders, we're talking about people here and the tragedy of all those lives lost at sea under a Labor government: all those families, all those children lost at sea because they lowered the borders. It's the same now. Look at the illegal vape operations that are happening. They say: 'We're tough on vapes. We're cracking down.' But they are creating a business model for criminals there too—'but we are tough on it'. It is always the same: tweet tough; act soft. The Australian people deserve better than that. They need consistency in word and in action, and they are not getting it from here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we asked if the same policies are involved and we get told about the mission. We ask if action has been taken. 'We don't comment.' We ask if we have taken any court responses. They don't answer the question. When you look into the microscope at the promises, when you look into the microscope at the claims and you look at the actions of what's happening, it's 'best endeavours, no care'. These are our borders. The people who come here need to be safe and they need to be people we want to have here. They need to be people that integrate with our society, that want to be Australians, that want a better life. And for everyone who does it illegally, somewhere there is a refugee in a camp that won't be taken. There are already enough problems in the world for people who want to be here and do it the right way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'We're not confirming here'. 'We don't answer.' 'We have had at least 12 boats come.' 'We're not answering.' Have we had at least 311 people come? There is no confirmation of this because we can't scrutinise it for the Australian people to see how it's going. These criminals who bring the boat people here—they are nothing more than criminals; they are bad people—are looking for weaknesses all of the time to exploit others, to exploit their clients, to exploit the very poorest people seeking trouble. They need to know that you will stand up and say: 'TPVs will stay. Everything that supports this policy that saves lives on oceans will stay.' Today you had the chance; today you didn't take that chance. Our borders are weaker for the answers that were not given.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  One thing you can always rely on the coalition to do is to politicise the issue of unauthorised boat arrivals. They don't show any compassion. They don't offer any solutions. They just want to play political games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was quite surprised when the previous speaker, Senator Cadell, mentioned former prime minister John Howard. When I hear Mr Howard's name the very first thing that comes to my mind are the untruths that were told about children overboard, the absolute untruths that were told about that. I don't think people forget that. People remember. Once again, that was political game playing by the then Prime Minister to try to win an election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then Senator Cadell spoke about us not talking about it. What was that line—let me think—'We don't broadcast on water activities; we don't talk about on water activities.' I heard that from the former coalition government for 10 years. They couldn't tell anybody anything. It was all very hush-hush. And on that side, they have so many people who are trying to create fear and anxiety amongst the public because they think that's what will win them the next federal election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cadell referred to Senator Sheldon's 'alleged outrage'. That side are the world's best at confecting outrage, and there's nothing they like better than to confect it when they're talking about unauthorised boat arrivals. There's no principle involved; they're just creating fear to try to win the next election. They refused to disclose or discuss anything when they were in government and they had lines about it: 'We don't discuss on water activities. We don't discuss this. We can't encourage the boats to arrive.' All of a sudden, when they're in opposition, they do a complete turn and are happy for that to be discussed. I think 'hypocritical' is the first word that comes to mind—and the other words are probably unparliamentary, so I won't say them out loud!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have to think about what the ulterior motive is that that side have, besides the fact they've got no policies to speak of. They feign concern about cost-of-living issues, but there was not one question today about cost-of-living issues. It just astounds me that they can come out all overexcited, trying to make people scared, trying to make out that they we're the saviours of unauthorised boat arrivals—but they weren't. We know there were boat arrivals under the previous government. We know there was an issue in Queensland very similar to what happened in Western Australia, but there is a convenient memory lapse on that side! They just like to perpetuate untruths for political pointscoring because it's their default position. They'll use all kinds of weasel words to try and create the impression that we've had some kind of departure on border security policy, when nothing could be further from the truth.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor remain committed to Operation Sovereign Borders; I don't know how many times we have to say it. We remain committed to the policy that people who arrive in Australia by unauthorised boat will never settle here and will have to seek third-country resettlement options. And, whatever tall tales those opposite try and tell the Australian people about the funding arrangements for border security, the fact is that we have increased funding by $470 million over the forward estimates; that has been proved. If you don't accept the government's word on any of this, you can listen to the words of the head of the Australian Border Force:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Border Force funding is currently the highest it's been since its establishment in 2015, and in the last year the ABF has received additional funding totalling hundreds of millions of dollars, to support maritime and land-based operations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's completely irresponsible and disingenuous of the opposition—and that includes Mr Dutton in the other place—to try and politicise this issue.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  The Albanese government is getting a reputation at home in Australia and abroad for all the wrong reasons. Here in Australia it is getting a reputation—more than getting a reputation; it has got a reputation—for not combating the cost-of-living increases that now punish every Australian family. It is getting a reputation for being deaf, dumb and blind to the increases in the cost of doing business that are now being felt by every Australian business, with many of them being forced to pass them on to consumers in order that they may continue to keep their doors open. And, now, Labor is getting a reputation for itself internationally for its weak leadership on border security.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a Western Australian senator, news of almost 40 illegal maritime arrivals reaching the north-west coast of Western Australia over the last few weeks unfortunately came to many Western Australians as another reminder of why this Labor government, led by Anthony Albanese—supported by Labor members of parliament like the member for Pearce, Tracey Roberts, the member for Cowan, Anne Aly, and the member for Perth, Patrick Gorman, who is the Prime Minister's right-hand man—has given up on the interests that are important to Western Australians. The fact is that an illegal vessel travelled across vast seas and reached the Australian mainland—in this case, the Western Australian mainland—and dropped passengers without detection. This, I might add, is a part of the world that I am very familiar with; I have been to Beagle Bay and to One Arm Point, and I regularly travel across from Broome to Kununurra on the road, on the single-lane highway. The fact that illegal maritime arrivals can arrive undetected is an embarrassment for this Labor government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's particularly bad for Western Australians because, as I said, it comes on top of a litany of other issues which are demonstrating that Western Australian priorities are the very last thing on the minds of this Labor government. Having wasted $450 million on a referendum—which didn't just fail but failed catastrophically, and which is now being criticised by some of those people who were so close to the referendum they almost owned it—means that very few Indigenous Australians living in the far north of Western Australia are getting the important services that they need.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are told the proposed tax on clothing is to encourage recycling. The proposal from the Minister for the Environment and Water was floated over the weekend. This was not some random thought bubble. The World Economic Forum and its acolytes have been saying for years that everyday citizens are buying too much clothing. Minister Plibersek repeated those World Economic Forum talking points in the same press conference. This begs the questions: What's the correct amount of clothing a person can own? Who decides how much clothing we each get to own? Is the intent to remove colour and style options so that a few approved uniforms are all we need? Didn't China try that already?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This proposal sits alongside the World Economic Forum policy that I spoke to last sitting, calling on people to wear clothing for a week and jeans for a month before washing them. It's true that laundering clothing does wear it out. To get by with fewer items of clothing, one has to wash them less often. At least they thought this through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's terrifying that a minister of the Crown would repeat World Economic Forum talking points designed to ensure that everyday Australians have less. The failure here, though, is this: the reason we throw out so much clothing is that Australians don't know clothing can be recycled. Councils don't have clothing on the lists of things you can put in a yellow bin. Retailers don't have recycling bins in stores, and they don't attach a tag to a garment saying, 'You can recycle the product in a yellow bin.' The industry already has recycling facilities in Sydney and Melbourne, which is a good start.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's an idea: instead of taxing clothing to create a new recycling system, as the Labor Party is considering, how about working with the industry to expand capability and then encourage the public to recycle clothing instead of throwing it out? This government needs to use less stick and more commonsense. It needs to use less control and do more listening and consulting.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is absolutely no case for drilling for dirty fossil fuels off the beautiful coastline of New South Wales. It will cause irreversible damage to our coast, our oceans and the wonderful marine life that lives within. It is a devastating prospect for our environment and climate, and it will hurt local industries and communities that depend on our oceans and coasts for their livelihoods. Yet today we heard more pathetic excuses for why the federal Labor government won't stop the climate-destroying PEP-11 project.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me remind you what Prime Minister Albanese promised in the lead-up to the last federal election: 'A Labor government that I lead will rule out PEP-11.' He also said that PEP-11 doesn't make sense 'from an economic, environmental or energy perspective.' In parliament he stood up and said that PEP-11 'should be consigned to the dustbin of history, where it belongs.' He said, 'This is a complete no-brainer.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't happen often, but, on this, I could not agree more with the Prime Minister. What is the Prime Minister waiting for? In the middle of a climate crisis, there is no excuse to drill for offshore gas under PEP-11 when we know that burning gas will only make things worse. As we sit on the cusp of a climate catastrophe, why hasn't the Prime Minister finally rejected PEP-11 as he so emphatically promised before the election? Is this a promise he intends to keep, or has the fossil fuel lobby got to him again to approve yet another climate-destroying project?</span>

From the outset, the Greens and I have campaigned with courageous communities who have been united in their opposition to PEP-11, and I want to give Natasha Deen and Save Our Coast a particular shout-out for their work to protect our climate and oceans. PEP-11 must be rejected in its entirety—no ifs, no buts. Once and for all, reject PEP-11.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Minister Watt will say that the government reject this notion—the notion that I have put to them. This is the government's first legislative act since the referendum on a voice to parliament, yet they seek to continue to silence the voices of First Nations people in this place. Minister King's office have told me—as have DISR, the department under her direction—that the consultation is ongoing. It is ongoing, but they are not speaking to the right people. They have 200 names of native title groups, organisations, industry, environmental groups, but no names of the First Nations people who are challenging these offshore gas projects in the Federal Court—no Tipakalippa, no Burke, no Cooper. I asked the department directly in Senate estimates two weeks ago as this bill was coming on, because I knew that, of the eight technical amendments that this minister is hoping to put through, one of the major ones is about the EPBC. It's about environmental approvals and seeking to water down the approvals that are already there.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reject Minister Watt's comments around this not being fast-tracking. In his words, putting them on the record, 'No. This is not about fast-tracking offshore gas projects.' It sure will be if this gets through—if it gets through the House and it gets through this place on a deal with the opposition about PRRT. And we know how broken that system is, because a teacher and a nurse pay more tax than the big gas cartel in this country. That's the deal that they will do with the opposition.</span>

You've let Woodside down. You've let Santos down.' We've heard it all come out, and it continues. It continued in that FOI that was released. It was about Santos.</span>

The Bill also ensures greater scrutiny of new NVR RTOs and promotes a quality vocational education and training (VET) sector that benefits students, industry, and the community. The Bill further incorporates some changes from the lapsed Regulator Performance Omnibus Bill 2022 (the Omnibus Bill). </span>

The 2018 All eyes on quality: Review of the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011 (the Braithwaite Review) also highlighted the need to strengthen quality and integrity in VET by placing more rigorous legislative requirements on NVR RTOs at the point of registration and throughout the registration period. The Braithwaite Review also recommended strengthening entry to market requirements to ensure NVR RTOs are committed to and capable of providing quality VET. The Bill implements recommendations from the Braithwaite Review and responds more broadly to the findings in the Nixon Review in relation to non-genuine VET providers. </span>

Specifically, where an NVR RTO has not delivered training and/or assessments for a period of 12 consecutive months its registration will automatically lapse by force of law. However, to ensure procedural fairness, all NVR RTOs will be able to apply to the Regulator for an extension to this 12-month period ahead of their registration lapsing. Where an NVR RTO is genuinely committed to providing training and assessment, but has legitimate, reasonable justification for not providing training or assessment, the Regulator will be able to grant an extension for a maximum of 12 months, after which no further extensions are available. The extension would ensure that the NVR RTO's registration will not lapse until the end of the period specified in the extension. It is intended that extensions will only be granted where the reason for which the NVR RTO has not provided training or assessments is demonstrably outside the control of the NVR RTO. Such limited circumstances could include, for example, natural disasters such as fire, flood, or pandemic events. Provided an NVR RTO begins delivering training and/or assessment within the period specified in the extension and it demonstrates that it is otherwise capable and committed, the NVR RTO's registration will not lapse after the extension period concludes. The Bill also proposes amendments to ensure that extension decisions are subject to internal and external merits review (via the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or, subject to the passage of legislation, the proposed Administrative Review Tribunal) in line with other reviewable decisions under the NVETR Act. The Bill proposes amendments to ensure that extension decisions are reviewable decisions under the NVETR Act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with recommendations of the Brathwaite Review, Part 2 of the Bill includes amendments to prevent an NVR RTO from changing, in the first two years of its registration, the courses it is registered to deliver to students. These amendments will help ensure those that are new to the sector are able to focus on delivering quality training or assessments in the segment of the market for which they were originally approved. Further, this would provide the Regulator with the opportunity to assess an NVR RTO's operations over a reasonable period to ensure the organisation has a sound understanding of the educational integrity and commitment required to operate in the sector prior to expanding its course offerings. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments proposed in Part 3 of the Bill would expand—from 90 to 120 days—the period in which the Regulator can conduct internal review of decisions, where a review application is made by an NVR RTO. While it is expected that most reviews will be completed within the current 90 day timeframe, this amendment will ensure the Regulator gives due consideration to review decisions, which are more complex and require detailed consideration. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Part 4 of the Bill includes amendments that allow the Regulator to consider and make decisions in relation to initial applications for registration in an order determined by the Regulator. Importantly, these amendments still require the Regulator to make a decision on applications for registration but provide the Regulator with greater flexibility in terms of how it prioritises, considers, and makes decisions in relation to applications—for example, taking into consideration areas of skills training shortages or community need. The amendments also give the Regulator the ability to decide non-complex applications quickly and efficiently, while applying appropriate scrutiny to complex applications or applications that raise potential integrity issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Part 5 of the Bill includes amendments that will empower the Minister to determine, via legislative instrument, a specified period where the Regulator is not required to, or must not, accept or process initial applications for NVR RTO registration under the NVETR Act. This will assist the Regulator to manage and address integrity risks identified in the VET sector in relation to NVR RTO market entry. The legislative instrument may apply to all initial applications for registration or to one or more classes of initial applications. Allowing for the instrument to apply to a particular class or classes of initial applications enables the Regulator to target specific cohorts of high-risk applicants or specific VET courses, without disrupting the acceptance and processing of other applications. The determination will require the Minister to consult with the Regulator and seek the Skills and Workforce Ministerial Council's agreement to the instrument prior to implementation. This will ensure the instrument cannot be made without the agreement of the states and territories and that the views of the Regulator are taken into consideration prior to the Minister making the instrument.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Amendments proposed in Part 6 of the Bill expand and strengthen offence and civil penalty provisions regarding false and misleading representations made by NVR RTOs. These amendments broaden the existing provisions to clarify that prohibited conduct includes making false and misleading representations in relation to the NVR RTO's operations. This strengthens consumer protections for students where unscrupulous or non-genuine NVR RTOs seek to attract student enrolments through false and misleading claims in relation to their operations. Inserting new provisions clarifies that prohibited conduct could include, but is not limited to:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Part 7 of the Bill will increase the penalty units specified under certain provisions in the NVETR Act to deter non-genuine or unscrupulous providers from breaching the NVETR Act and to reduce the financial benefits and incentives to engage in conduct in breach of the NVETR Act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The maximum penalty units for a breach of a relevant offence or civil penalty provision under Part 6 of the NVETR Act will increase, along with the penalty units specified under section 64, subsection 71(3) and subsection 79(2) of the NVETR Act. The amendments provide for increased maximum penalties for offences and civil contraventions which threaten VET integrity, student protection or otherwise are indicative of practices that may be associated with non-genuine or unscrupulous providers. It is intended that an increase in penalty units send a strong signal to non-genuine or unscrupulous NVR RTOs and potential providers that heavy penalties will be applied for breaches of the legislation. These increased penalty provisions are the maximum penalties that could be imposed by a court and are intended to ensure that the imposition of such penalties operate as more than just a cost of doing business for a non-genuine or unscrupulous provider. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill would also increase the penalty units specified under subsections 211(3) and 211(4) of the NVETR Act. Those subsections relate to a failure to provide a copy of VET student records, which is an issue that affects students when a provider ceases to operate, or the provider's registration is cancelled or lapses. A higher penalty may support better student outcomes by ensuring that providers and their executive officers are incentivised to provide the Regulator with a copy of affected students' records in such situations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The amended penalty regime will apply in relation to offences committed, or contraventions, acts or omissions that occur on or after the commencement of the Bill. Courts have the discretion to determine the appropriate penalty amount, up to the maximum set under the law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with the principles set out in the Attorney-General Department's Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Infringement Notices and Enforcement Powers (the Guide), the increased maximum penalty units prescribed under the amended provisions will be adequate to deter and punish the worst-case offences. Those involved in breaches of the NVETR Act may receive large financial benefits from their misconduct. The penalty units in the NVETR Act have not been increased since the NVETR Act commenced, and the increases the Bill proposes reflect the changing structure and nature of the VET market over that period. The increase of financial penalties is appropriate for regulatory and disciplinary purposes. The Guide notes that a higher maximum penalty will be justified where there are strong incentives to commit the offence, or where the consequences of the commission of the offence are particularly dangerous or damaging. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments proposed in Part 8 of the Bill will help support efficient and effective regulation of the VET sector. These amendments were included as part of the lapsed Omnibus Bill, which senior State and Territory Government officials were consulted on. Specifically, the amendments clarify the use of personal information contained in audit reports, align registration requirements with similar requirements under the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (ESOS Act) and clarify review processes to better align with the internal review process in the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 (TEQSA Act). This streamlines interactions for entities regulated by both the Regulator and TEQSA under the ESOS Act. The Bill also makes technical amendments to a number of sections in the NVETR Act to ensure alignment with new provisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, Part 9 of the Bill would amend the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator (Transitional Provisions) Act to set out transitional arrangements. Those arrangements would ensure the effective and efficient operation of the Bill on commencement by specifying how the amendments will operate during the period immediately post-commencement. For example, section 4 of the transitional provisions provides that Part 2 of the Bill relating to change to scope of registration will only apply to applications made on or after the day of the Bill's commencement (the day the Bill receives the Royal Assent). Applications received prior to this date will not be affected by the amendments.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill is urgent and requires introduction and passage in the 2024 Autumn sittings period to ensure that amendments can be implemented as soon as possible. This is necessary to assist the Regulator in taking action against providers who do not intend to deliver quality training and are being used as a veil of legitimacy for fraudulent activities. The changes would ensure the sector and the broader community can have confidence that NVR RTOs delivering and/or assessing VET are providing quality education and training and are legitimate operators. If the Bill is not passed in the 2024 Autumn sittings the Regulator will not be in a position to take action against non-genuine and unscrupulous providers in a timely manner, leaving students and Government exposed to fraudulent and otherwise exploitative activities of unscrupulous and non-genuine NVR RTOs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The policing, surveillance, criminalisation, and detention of First Peoples children is a humanitarian crisis and the youth carceral system is operating in breach of this country's human rights obligations. Children need culture, country, connection, and family, not prisons. The billions spent on police, prisons and surveillance must be urgently re-invested into First Peoples self-determined community programs and services to provide appropriate wrap-around support to women, children, and families.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1991, 33 First Nations children have been killed in custody that we know of. My thoughts are with those families. Losing a child is something no-one should have to go through. There are 17 prisons for children across this country, where our babies, some as young as 10, are held in horrific conditions, being abused, starved and tortured, in breach of all human rights obligations. Over 50 per cent of these kids are First Nations, when we are just three per cent of the population. These babies are being torn away from culture, country and everything they know, too far away for family to visit. As said by Dylan Voller, a survivor of torture at Don Dale, said, these are kids:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… from a beautiful culture, the oldest continuing culture in the world, with so much to teach about how we can live in harmony together and with the land. But … their elders have been pushed aside by a government hungry for land and power. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the Australian government uses brutality against children for their own political ends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Children's Commissioner, Anne Hollonds, said that decades of evidence show that harsh punitive measures go against all recommendations from across the world and do not keep the community safer. In fact, the states with the toughest youth crime laws are the ones with the biggest problems. The Standing Council of Attorneys-General has a report, which is in the hands of all of the state governments, clearly stating that locking up children will only cause more harm to the community. We know increased punitive measures do nothing to address the underlying social issues, yet this so-called progressive Labor government have a few native police officers in their ranks. Your own Marion Scrymgour is making disgusting calls to treat our kids even more harshly, when they are already being openly hunted, locked up and tortured, and then Senator McCarthy is giving black money to the police dogs, adding to the billions of dollars being spent on this racist system every single year. Native police in your own ranks—shame!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine if instead these billions on police stations and prisons and police surveillance were reinvested into First Peoples self-determined wraparound community services to support our women, children and families. We know this works. Children need culture, country, connection and family, not prisons. We're talking about 10-year-olds! It is beyond time for the federal government to show leadership, to commit to real justice reinvestment, to raise the federal age of criminal legal responsibility and to comply with the human rights obligations they signed up to.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300644" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LIDDLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  There are actions the Prime Minister can take today to reduce the rates of children entering the youth justice system and for adults entering the justice system. To make a difference, you have to deal with domestic and family violence, and you have to deal with the issue of child protection and recidivism. It's not just the police, the courts and the prisons; it's everyone who has to take action here. It is parents being responsible for getting children to school and ensuring home is a safe haven, not somewhere of chaos and trauma from which they escape and inevitably find trouble.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that youth incarceration is in large part caused by a failing child protection system. Around 58,000 Indigenous children come into contact with child protection in any given year, and that number is going up. Around 22,000 Indigenous children are subject to child protection orders in any given year, and that number is going up. The Victorian Aboriginal Justice Agreement states that, of the Aboriginal children involved in the youth justice system, 81 per cent were victims of abuse, trauma or neglect, and 78 per cent experienced domestic and family violence. The Productivity Commission report of March 2020 recognises that most children are raised in loving, positive environments and that the risk of harm to children is exacerbated by a higher prevalence of other risk factors, such as poverty, unemployment, overcrowding, mental health issues, substance misuse and, of course, family violence. The link is undeniable. For adults, family violence results in greater risk of exposure to police, courts and prisons, too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indigeneity of itself does not condemn Indigenous people to a life of harm, crime and trauma. But for too many, that is their reality. It's the focus on those who need it most that should get our attention, and we should act on everything. It might be uncomfortable to talk about sexual abuse, coercive control, and physical and mental abuse. But talking about the hard stuff is what truth-telling is really about. Until we reduce the number of young people in the child protection system we won't be able to reduce the number of children behind bars. Indigenous children are 10.5 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children, an overrepresentation of some 800 per cent. Most Indigenous children are taken into the system before they turn one year old, and the likelihood of their being returned home is bleak. In New South Wales, just 15.2 per cent return home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where it is safe to do so—and only where it is safe to do so, because the work has been done—children should be assisted to return to their families. This motion suggests redirecting money from police and prisons to an Indigenous corporation. I don't think that's the answer. Better-targeted funding, removal of duplication, accountability, and focus on outcomes not outputs are what's needed in greater measure. This also means an audit of services that deliver to the most vulnerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that irresponsible actions of ideologically driven politicians has also contributed to making an already bad situation worse. I'm referring to the removal of the cashless debit card in those communities that asked for a trial and the reckless lifting of alcohol bans in the Northern Territory. When spending on alcohol, drugs and gambling rather than on food, education and essentials occurs, the change for the most vulnerable is not for the better. In former trial site Bundaberg, the rate of domestic and family violence offences rose by 24 per cent. In former trial site Kalgoorlie-Boulder, breaches of violence restraint orders skyrocketed by 48 per cent. When I travelled to the region in January the shire councils, the shelters, the emergency frontline workers, the teachers and the locals told the same sad, sorry, shameful stories: more lives shattered, more demand for emergency services, more money needed to rebuild lives. The silent victims of this family and domestic violence epidemic are children and the most vulnerable. Sometimes those who were once innocent victims end up as perpetrators facing police, courts and our prisons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years ago the Albanese government promised 500 new frontline community service workers to combat escalating family and domestic violence. To date they've delivered just two. I've yet to hear someone plausibly explain how an ice-skating rink in Alice Springs, painting roller shutters and supporting music festivals will change the lives of the most vulnerable. Senator Thorpe is right: all contributors to this issue need to be part of the solution. It's not one versus the other. There needs to be an improvement in the expectations of services delivered. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEWART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I want to start by acknowledging Senator Thorpe for bringing the important issues impacting First Nations communities to this chamber today. It is indisputable that yes, children need culture, country and connection to family. It is indisputable that women, children and families need access to support services when and where they need them. And it is indisputable that families and community members need to have control over these programs and services. The evidence tells us that when Aboriginal people have a seat at the table our children are happier and our families are healthier. But this cannot be done by simply throwing money around. We must, above all else, empower First Nations communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Gunditjmara country in south-west Victoria Winda-Mara Aboriginal Corporation is recognised as a progressive leader for positive change in the community. In 1990 a group of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community members came together on Gunditjmara country in south-west Victoria to discuss the needs and aspirations of the mob at the time. From that initial meeting, the attendees determined to form an Aboriginal community controlled organisation in Heywood focusing on addressing the housing, health, employment, child removal and education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Winda-Mara has since celebrated its 30th birthday and continues to go from strength to strength. The organisation is now a well-respected Aboriginal community controlled organisation with over 85 staff, working from offices in Hamilton, Haywood and Portland in the south-west corner of Victoria. Winda-Mara manages medical centres and housing properties tenanted to Indigenous Victorians. Their work in the community services space includes supporting cultural strengthening, regional local justice, playgroup and youth mentoring programs. They also talk about having some of the lowest incarceration rates in the state because of what they do and how they do it. The team at Winda-Mara are passionate, kind and effective. They have high aspirations not just for First Nations people but for the entire region, and the determination to match it. Leaders like Uncle Mookeye, JB, Ben Church and Jason Walker are working to engage young people plus build opportunities for mob.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, construction will begin on Winda-Mara's new medical clinic in Heywood and a new integrated family services building. These developments not only will strengthen the quality of services provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community members—and other community members are welcome to use the service—but also will contribute to the regional economy at large. More construction in the regions means more jobs for builders, plumbers, sparkies and site managers. We must continue to build on the strength and resilience of First Nations people to achieve better outcomes because, after all, what's good for mob is good for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through justice reinvestment, the Albanese Labor government has invested a historic $91.5 million to enable a community led approach to prevent First Nations people coming into contact with the criminal justice system in the first place. We are also implementing a wide range of other measures to support communities, including working in partnership with First Nations people to deliver a new remote jobs and economic development program and establishing a national commissioner for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people to help achieve progress under the Closing the Gap agreement. I note that a commissioner for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children is something that mob have been asking for for a very, very long time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In any conversation around supporting First Nations people we must look to the success of the deadly organisations already operating in this space and work with them to identify and remove barriers to further success. That pathway requires a strong emphasis on self-determination, trust and power sharing with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. It requires us to support and create pathways and remove barriers to economic participation and inclusion. It requires a long-term focus and commitment. It requires us to build mob up, not tear them down. I would say that most First Nations senators and members in this place have a shared commitment in wanting better for our communities, and referring to members and senators in this place in a derogatory way does nothing to advance that cause.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  I rise in support of this motion brought by Senator Thorpe to this place today. We all know the crippling and absolutely unacceptable overrepresentation of First Nations people in our justice system. I want to share some of those statistics today. In the September 2023 quarter, there were 14,183 First Nations prisoners across Australia. This is an increase from the June 2023 quarter, when there were 14,011. More than a thousand more First Nations people are in prison than in the September 2022 quarter because of the actions of frontline responders and of police across this country—and they are at the heart of the problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge some of the points that senators who have already spoken have made—that these are all interlinked, interconnected, with some of the issues we are seeing in closing the gap. But we also have three very specific targets—targets 10, 11 and 12—that have been set out for this federal government to do something about, and the cries from across this country about how we do that and how we achieve that are going to need bold action. We cannot continue to sit in this place and the other and push the responsibility back on the states and territories. Across all jurisdictions, governments are given hundreds of millions of dollars, particularly in the area of policing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have sat and listened to how this money can be spent better in our communities. I have worked in academia. I have worked in the research area. I have listened to community consultations about justice reinvestment. What people are saying isn't about giving more money to the police or to white NGOs in communities. It's about giving community an opportunity to do what they need to with diverting those youth and investing in our people and addressing some of those underlying social issues and social causes which are at the core of this—housing, education, employment, health care, access to the basic services and necessities in our communities. We are living in Third World conditions in some of our jurisdictions. I don't want to hear people say that we got running water because of colonisation. That is not true. You can't even drink the water that's running in some of the communities in my home state of Western Australia. So that's a farce. We need to give up that game and stop buying into that rhetoric. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am all for defunding the police. I am absolutely in support of that. Get them back to their core function and let them own the title of colonial police forces in this country. Let them own that title, because that's what they were put in place for. That's truth-telling. Police forces in this country are doing their damnedest to not give us justice. Justice means that we are judged by our peers. We are not judged by our peers when there are white magistrates, white juries, in this country, who are continuing to do the job. They are not our peers. We need to think fundamentally about the role of the justice system. I am referring to this as the justice pipeline, and it needs to be dismantled. Senator Liddle is absolutely right: child protection plays such a huge part. We are only two or three generations from the stolen generation. In some households, like mine, we are only one generation away. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On rehabilitation versus punishment in this country: rehabilitation is not happening. The current system is not rehabilitating anybody; it's a revolving door. That's what's happening in our communities, and there sure as hell is no pathway to making sure that people are actually getting the support and the help that they need in these institutions. It is appalling. There is Banksia Hill. There is Unit 18 in Casuarina Prison in my home state, where they used a riot squad on a 16-year-old boy who had a health crisis—Cleveland Dodd, who was the first child to die in custody. This is shameful. It's a shame and a stain on our history. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  Rates of incarceration are still too high. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are over-represented at every point in the justice system. So I thank Senator Thorpe for bringing the motion before the chamber today and I thank the other speakers who have contributed to the debate so far. We still have a lot of work to do to address that over-representation and, in particular, to help the young people who are affected in so many ways by the disadvantage that still afflicts so many Aboriginal communities. As the Prime Minister has said, by any standard the status quo is not working. We cannot keep doing the same thing expecting a different outcome. All levels of government will need to do better if we are to make progress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of the national agreement underwriting closing the gap, there is a simple principle: the key to practical and sustainable change is ensuring that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are involved and empowered in the design and delivery of policies, programs and services that affect their lives, their families and their communities. We are determined to work with the Coalition of Peaks on structural changes to the way that governments work with communities—formal partnerships and shared decision-making, building the community-controlled sector, transforming government organisations so they work for everyone and sharing access to data and information so that we can work together to make the right decisions together and act on the evidence that's before us. If we can get these fundamental reforms right, we can make progress on the targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the targets, as everyone here completely understands, reach across health, education, economic development, housing, infrastructure and justice, and we can't untangle the unacceptable rates of incarceration from these other measures and these other metrics. We also can't untangle them from the systems which are principally controlled by state and territory governments, including many of those systems associated with justice and policing. It's why colleagues are interested in speaking about justice reinvestment approaches, and it's why the government is interested in funding them and supporting them. They offer us the opportunity to provide an integrated response to the challenges faced by communities and to work with communities to identify how those responses should be organised and delivered. Justice reinvestment empowers First Nations communities and leaders to develop local solutions that divert people who are at risk away from the criminal justice system and, more importantly perhaps, provide the social and community underpinnings that support people to have happy, engaged, prosperous lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the government has committed a historic $91.5 million to enable these community led approaches. We've named some of the first recipients in places where we seek to work: in Cowra, in Maningrida, in Groote Eylandt, in Central Australia, in Cherbourg, in Yarrabah, in Townsville, in Derby, in Balgo and, of course, in Halls Creek and in Alice Springs. It is the largest justice reinvestment commitment ever developed by the Commonwealth government. These approaches had been attempted elsewhere in a period when the Commonwealth government was not interested in engaging, and these programs are showing that they can work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own home state, the Maranguka Justice Reinvestment Project in Bourke has been an incredibly important project, initiated and run by local people. Bourke has 3,000 residents, 20 per cent of whom identify as Aboriginal. In 2013, elders in the community decided that a new way of thinking and doing things was required. They initiated this project, designed to better coordinate support for families and kids and to operate as a community hub that is community led and can work in partnership with state governments and non-government agencies. The overarching goal is to decrease the rate of contact First Nations children and young people have with the criminal justice system. It works within the pillars of cultural authority, collaborative and flexible service delivery, shared decision-making, brokering of social solutions to systemic challenges and operationalising of First Nations data sovereignty, and it has had an impact—a 39 per cent reduction in the number of juveniles charged in the top five offence categories. We are committed to building on the successes that have been demonstrated— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  Equal laws for all and special laws for none. Equal rights for all and special rights for none. This is the only acceptable position in a democracy that is free and fair. In a true democracy with true equality, arbitrary characteristics like race never determine the outcome in courts or from the enforcement of the law. In a true democracy there is no place for separate laws and courts based on race. In a true democracy, we are all equal before the law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The activists who promote the Voice and the activists who claim exclusive Aboriginal sovereignty over Australia do not support equality or democracy. They despise equality and democracy. They despise reconciliation and national unity. They support the tyrannical politics of victimhood and grievance. They tried to insert this tyranny into the Constitution. They literally sit in this building, the seat of democracy in Australia, while attacking the principles upon which it was built. The hypocrisy is absolutely breathtaking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Thorpe says Indigenous Australian children need their families, not prisons. I agree. But they need functional families who teach respect for the law and for the police who enforce the law on behalf of their communities. They do not need dysfunctional families who neglect or abuse their children. This is what is happening in many remote Indigenous communities, in country towns, in major regional centres and in our big cities. Indigenous Australian children roam the streets, looking for trouble, because it's safer than being at home with their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This epidemic of abuse has been destroying the lives of countless Indigenous Australian children. Countless times, we've called for a royal commission into the sexual abuse. But everyone says, 'No, we don't need it.' It's an epidemic that the activists do not acknowledge exists—despite many Indigenous leaders in these communities desperately calling for help to end it—because, for the activists, if you're Indigenous, you can do no wrong. For them, if you're Indigenous, you should be above the laws that apply to the rest of Australia—except that is complete nonsense, because of one thing: democracy itself. Indigenous Australians have had as much say in the creation of our laws as every other Australian, thanks to democracy. It's keeping to the principles of democracy that will ultimately empower Indigenous Australians. It's keeping to the rule of law that will ensure justice ultimately prevails for all Australians, regardless of race.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  I, first of all, want to commend the contribution from Senator Dorinda Cox, and I could begin and end this speech by saying what Senator Cox said in her clear statement of the need for First Nations peoples to be making decisions about their kids and about their communities, as the recipients of the resources of federal and state governments that are designed to be uplifting First Nations communities. That's what is absolutely needed in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As this motion makes clear, justice reinvestment is not happening in this country. Justice reinvestment is meant to be taking money from prisons and police and putting it into the communities instead. No state government has, no territory government has, and never has the federal government taken money from the police and the prisons and actually put it into uplifting First Nations communities and put it where it's most needed: in those community-run organisations that know best how to look after their kids and their grandkids. We hear talk of justice reinvestment, but it's never about taking money away from the prisons and the police; it's always about giving more money for prisons and more money for police.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just look at Queensland, at the growth in the number of First Nations kids in watch houses. Just look at the Northern Territory, where we'd find, if we checked, that pretty much every kid in jail there tonight would be a First Nations kid. And the numbers are shameful across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's not spend more money on the prisons and the police and on putting more kids in jail. Let's spend money on Nelly's Healing Centre, in my home state of New South Wales. It's run by an incredible Gamilaraay and Birrbay woman, Helen Eason. I have seen the work she does—the families she saves; the kids she has kept with their families. Let's look at Grandmothers against Removals and the incredible work that those women are doing—First Nations women from my state and from across the country. And let's look at Abcare, on Gumbaynggirr land, which is keeping kids with families. Spend the money there, not on more cops and more prisons.</span>

                  </a>  I'll take that interjection, Senator Watt. It is a good question. Why is this motion, calling upon the Prime Minister to restore Operation Sovereign Borders to its original design, being moved? There are three reasons that I rise to move this motion today. The first is the recent report of almost 40 illegal maritime arrivals reaching the mainland undetected in Western Australia's north in the last week or so. There were almost 40 undetected illegal maritime arrivals on the Australian mainland approximately one week ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to read from an ABC report in relation to this, just to give everyone listening to this debate the full flavour of what is happening here. It talks about how a local Aboriginal tourism operator discovered 13 of these arrivals, 13 men. With indulgence, I'll refer to the hospitable way in which our local Aboriginal community treated the arrivals. I'll quote from this Aboriginal tourism operator, who preferred to remain anonymous:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They all congregated at the water tap—they were really thirsty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report goes on:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He spent two hours with the men waiting for authorities to arrive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They reported being dropped off in the middle of the night along the rocky shoreline of Pender Bay, and then walking in the bush for four days before being found.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And they begged him for help to get to Sydney to find work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They begged him to help them get to Sydney to find work. That's what they asked for. The local Aboriginal tourism operator said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Border Force have a tough job, but there does have to be more layers of surveillance in place. These guys had a success making it here, so there will probably be more turning up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the first reason I raise this motion today: the concern that the Albanese Labor government is not protecting our borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second reason is that we know—it is on the record—there have been at least 311 illegal maritime arrivals, potentially on 13 different vessels, in this country since Labor was elected in May 2022, so this isn't the first issue we've had since Labor was re-elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third reason I rise to speak this motion is that no-one in this country wants us to return to the dark, dark days of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, when we had thousands of illegal maritime arrivals in this country, thousands of children in detention, and a cost of billions and billions to the Australian taxpayer. That's why we're raising this issue. We're actually obliged to raise this issue on behalf of the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back on 26 April 2022, the Prime Minister said, 'The same policy that exists now, Operation Sovereign Borders, will apply under us.' But it doesn't. The Labor government removed one of the key pillars of Operation Sovereign Borders. I have here the document from the coalition announcing Operation Sovereign Borders, and one of the key pillars was restoration of temporary protection visas for those found to be refugees. That was one of the key pillars of Operation Sovereign Borders. It was removed by the Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other concerning thing the Labor government has removed is budget allocations for our border security. The irrefutable fact is that maritime patrols and aerial surveillance have dropped. It isn't the fault of the Australian Border Force; it's because they aren't being adequately funded. There has been a budget cut of over $400 million over the forward estimates. There has been a 20.7 per cent decrease in aerial flying hours and a 12.2 per cent decrease in maritime patrol days. This is happening under Labor's watch. It needs to stop, and Operation Sovereign Borders needs to be reinstated.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  The question is right: why are we in this position having this debate? Clearly, the reason we're here is because there's an attempt by the opposition to undermine our borders. There's a political opportunity, here—not an opportunity that's in the interests of the Australian public, not an opportunity that's in the interests of the Australian community, but a political opportunity to turn around and misrepresent what's actually going on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the same people that turned around, on that fateful election day, the decision by the previous government, led by the member for Cook, that put at risk operational protocols to protect Operation Sovereign Borders—and they're at it again. On that particular occasion, under the direction of the former prime minister, the former home affairs minister ordered a senior military officer to issue a public statement compromising a live, military-led operation. The opposition are here asking questions not because they're concerned about the boats, or because they're concerned about protecting Operation Sovereign Borders, or because they're concerned with national security, but for no reason other than the fact that they want to create fear and division. These comments and their comments will be exploited by people smugglers. That is a disgrace. What they're creating is an environment which is untrue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great lies—one of the many lies—that the opposition have put forward is that Peter Dutton said we're cutting funding to the ABF—the Australian Border Force. Again, there is disinformation from the Leader of the Opposition, who should know better. There has been, in fact, an increase of $470 million under this government, including more than $200 million this year, as the ABF Commissioner Michael Outram said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Border force funding is currently the highest it's been since its establishment in 2015 and in the last year the ABF has received additional funding totalling hundreds of millions of dollars, to support maritime and land-based operations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So who should we believe? Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, and the opposition, or the ABF Commissioner? They don't like the facts, because when you go through the fact you hear more. Admiral Brett Sonter, Commander of the Joint Agency Task Force Operation Sovereign Borders, made it abundantly clear. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"The mission of Operation Sovereign Borders remains the same today as it was when it was established in 2013: protect Australia's borders, combat people smuggling in our region, and importantly, prevent people from risking their lives at sea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, get this; this is really important—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had some discussion about this earlier in question time. Some people were saying that this is a fictitious argument put forward, so they're saying the admiral in charge of Operation Sovereign Borders is getting it wrong. They're saying the commissioner in charge of the Australian Border Force is getting it wrong. They have said on both occasions what has been said by the opposition leader and by those opposite: that it will result in additional people-smugglers and people being put at risk in the sea lanes of this region. The opposition leader is becoming a marketing tool for people smugglers because he is misrepresenting the facts. The ABF and the ADF have said very clearly how this is moving forward: it is the same Operation Sovereign Borders; it is very well funded; it's an expert operation run by one of the most senior naval officers in the country. We respect and are grateful for the work the ABF do to protect our borders and we back Operation Sovereign Borders. That's the reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the visa question, that part of the motion shows, again, the absurdity of their argument. Unauthorised maritime arrivals—that is, people seeking to enter Australia on a boat with a passport or visa—are subject to offshore processing. That is what happened in the past and what continues to happen today. But they constantly put our borders at risk with the unfounded, inaccurate descriptions that they've been putting forward in these debates of the last week. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  Well, have a listen to this utter disgrace of a debate, these utterly disgraceful speaking points from both sides of this chamber. Let's all take a deep breath and understand what happened a couple of weeks ago. A very small number—40 people; a tiny number—of vulnerable and desperate people arrived in Australia by boat without visas in order to ask us for protection and to ask us for our assistance. And instead of our response and the ensuing national debate being about how we could actually help them, what we could do to support them—a debate that would have been in line with Australian values like generosity, compassion and decency—we have had the debate framed exclusively around this so-called massive threat to our borders and to our national security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those folks are not a threat to our borders and they are not a threat to our national security. The reason the debate is framed in that way is because it suits the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton. He is a political vampire who feeds on people's suffering. It's what gets him out of bed in the morning and what leads him to believe he can win the next election, if he weaponises enough migrants and enough people seeking asylum in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, the compliant media—led by News Corp but by no means exclusively News Corp—jump in, credulously report Mr Dutton's frame and suddenly you have the Labor Party trying to outdo Mr Dutton on border security. This is how we destroyed thousands of lives in offshore detention. This is how we exiled thousands of people to Manus Island and Nauru, where they were murdered, where they were raped, where their children were subjected to sexual abuse and where they were attacked by the armed forces of Papua New Guinea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the race to the bottom that weaponises people seeking asylum and destroys thousands of lives. The media's complicit. The Labor Party's complicit. And it's driven by the Liberal Party, because it is their political aim to get these outcomes, not because anyone is prepared to actually take a decent step and help support vulnerable people who seek our protection.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  I rise to speak on this urgency motion brought to the Senate today by my colleague Senator Scarr. And it is critical that we bring this motion to the Senate today because we all know that having control over our borders is essential for the ongoing security and safety of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is simply not good enough that people smugglers have, in recent days, exploited apparent weaknesses of our maritime border with reports of 40 illegal maritime arrivals reaching Western Australia. And what is even more concerning is that these latest groups appear to have made their way through Australian waters undetected to arrive on Australian soil. It is clear that people smugglers are once again exploiting the Labor government's weak leadership on border security. There have been more than 300 people on at least 12 boats that have arrived on Labor's watch since the 2022 election. We know that maritime patrols and aerial surveillance have dropped under Labor, as the ABF has failed to meet its targets. There was a 20.7 per cent decrease in aerial flying hours in 2022-23 compared with 2020-21, and there was a 12.2 per cent fall in maritime patrol days in 2022-23 compared with 2020-21. These facts speak for themselves. It is clear for everyone to see that there are cracks that have emerged in Australia's border security under the watch of this Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This recent maritime arrival is just the latest incident where the Albanese government has been exposed on border protection and national security. We all know that they were caught flat-footed by last year's High Court decision. As a direct consequence of the government's lack of preparedness, 140 hardcore criminals, including child sex offenders and murderers, were released into our community, and it wasn't until recently that we were able to get the full picture of the types of characters who were released. After months of sustained pressure from the coalition, at Senate estimates recently the Albanese government finally released the document that it didn't want the public to see. The government admitted that there are seven murderers, 37 sex offenders and 72 violent offenders among the 149 people the government released into the community following the High Court's decision last year. The government also admitted that seven people breached their visa conditions once they got out and that 18 people have been charged by state and territory police for various offences. Worse, the government admitted that it hadn't made a single application to lock up any of these hardcore criminals released onto the streets, despite rushing through ahead of Christmas the legislation giving them the powers to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is incredibly disappointing. I think Australians are disappointed with the efforts or lack thereof that this government has made to keep Australians safe and to keep our borders safe. Conversely, we know that the coalition has a strong track record when it comes to border protection, and the results of our border policies speak for themselves. It was the coalition government which broke the back of the people-smuggling trade that was allowed to flourish during the Rudd-Gillard years. We cannot forget that, the last time Labor was in government, more than 50,000 people arrived illegally on more than 800 boats, and there were at least 1,200 deaths at sea. It was the coalition government that restored order and stemmed the flow of illegal boat arrivals through the implementation of Operation Sovereign Borders. Like I say, the facts speak for themselves. There had not been a successful boat arrival in years under the coalition after we introduced Operation Sovereign Borders, and we ended the deaths at sea. Frankly, only the coalition can be trusted to keep Australians safe and our border secure. What we have seen in Western Australia in recent weeks demonstrates that clearly. It was the coalition's strong border policies that stopped the boats, ending both the deaths at sea and the illegal trade of people smuggling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt, from the opposition's point of view, that this government must act immediately to protect Australia's borders from future illegal maritime arrivals and to ensure that our community is kept safe. It is simply not good enough that we have seen instances where boats have been able to navigate through Australian waters and land on our shores undetected. People smugglers are exploiting this government's lax approach to border security, but we know that maritime patrols and aerial surveillance have dropped under this government. There have been more than 300 people on at least 12 boats who have arrived on Labor's watch since the 2022 election. We need to send a strong and clear message to people smugglers that we take the protection of our border extremely seriously, but I have very little faith that that will happen under this government.</span>

That's because Labor's incompetence has basically put out the welcome mat for the people smugglers. These smugglers are the lowest form of vermin, preying on human misery and false hope. They have noted how immigrant murderers and sex offenders are being allowed to roam freely in our community by this Labor government. They have noted Labor won't maintain the level of monitoring and surveillance necessary to deter their attacks on our borders. They are absolutely delighted that Labor has gotten rid of temporary protection visas, a critical deterrent against their foul business model.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor cannot be trusted with the security of our borders. Australia must return to the full model that stopped the boats. It's the only proven effective model that prevents deaths at sea. It's a model admired in many countries whose borders are being attacked by people smugglers. It should beggar belief that Labor would sacrifice the security of our borders and the safety of our community by dismantling this model. Sadly, however, it's very believable. Labor has never supported a strong border, and it was only a matter of time before the people smugglers returned. Because of the way the High Court decision has been handled and because of the release of 149 out of our prisons or detention centres, I call for Minister Giles to be sacked. He has got to go. He is hopeless as a minister and incompetent at his job. At the next election I hope the people of Australia realise that our current Prime Minister has to go also for his incompetence and for how this matter has been handled. As far as I am concerned, our security is of utmost importance for this nation and for the people of Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I say to the Labor Party: how dare you accuse the coalition of politicising Sovereign Borders. It was under the Labor Party that we had over a thousand deaths at sea—under the reckless Rudd government, which relaxed our border control. Over 50,000 people ended up in detention camps, and it has taken over a decade to effectively reduce those numbers. So for the Labor Party to come in here and accuse us of playing politics is sheer hypocrisy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we should note here is that Australia actually has a very generous refugee policy. We take almost 20,000 refugees a year, on a humanitarian basis. There are certainly, if not millions, hundreds of thousands people out there around the world in refugee camps who have done the right thing and have tried to apply for a visa. When we have people smugglers smuggling people through the back door, many of whom aren't even genuine refugees—when I looked at the photos of the guys that rocked up last week, they didn't look too hungry to me. I think that this is something the Labor Party should take very seriously and not mock the fact that we actually lose control of our borders. If you look at what has happened in Europe, Africans are dying when they cross the Mediterranean from places like Libya to Italy. You get thousands of people dying at sea. So it is much better to have a strong border policy, to make sure that people don't—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The need for Prime Minister Albanese to restore Operation Sovereign Borders to its original design under the former Coalition government, including re-introducing temporary protection visas, to send a clear message to people smugglers that Australia takes the protection of its borders seriously</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Prime Minister Albanese came to power, there have been at least 311 illegal maritime arrivals in Australia, who have come on at least 13 boats. At least 40 came in the last few days, reaching the mainland of Australia undetected. It shows that the people smugglers are exploiting the weakness of the Albanese government when it comes to protecting the borders of Australia. The No. 1 job of any government is to protect Australia, to protect our borders and to protect our people. When the Prime Minister is asked on live TV what he's going to do to prevent illegal immigration or how he could possibly justify his dismantling of Operation Sovereign Borders—or when he was asked about this most recent arrival, do you know what the Prime Minister said? This is what the Prime Minister of this country said. He said he is not across it because he has been in the car. What has he been doing in the car? Having a nap? Playing <span style="font-style:italic;">Grand Theft Auto</span>? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a Prime Minister who has tens of thousands of public servants—departments of defence and home affairs—who clearly report in as to what is happening on our borders. Now, either they're not being resourced properly or he's not being told what's going on—or he doesn't care. So, it is either incompetence or malfeasance, or it's just a Prime Minister who's not up to the job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People smugglers can smell weak leadership. We saw that in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. We saw how the people smugglers exploited that weak Labor government. And we can see now how the people smugglers are exploiting this weak Labor government. It is time for someone like Peter Dutton, an ex-copper from Queensland, to become prime minister—someone who understands the importance of the safety of Australians, someone who understands, who will bring back Operation Sovereign Borders and protect Australia and make sure we can sleep safely in our beds at night. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="283585" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  I'm really pleased to stand today in support of this urgency motion brought by Senator Scarr. As Senator McGrath was just outlining, this is ultimately just about the Senate calling upon the Prime Minister to get real, to get serious, to actually put his heart into Operation Sovereign Borders. We know, based on the actions, based on the budget allocations, based on what we're seeing in the operations, that this Prime Minister is not committed fully to Operation Sovereign Borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It really hasn't taken the Labor government too long to start failing on border security, has it? It was almost predictable form for the Labor government, and this Prime Minister, who was a senior minister in the last failed government, when it came to border security. And we're seeing now the creaks and the cracks in the doors that are starting to open because this government doesn't take it seriously. Their heart is not in it. Their heart is not in Operation Sovereign Borders. Otherwise we wouldn't see the cuts that are there—to budget, to flights, to surveillance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Western Australia—and it's good to see Senator Smith here—we know that our state of course is a very large state and the coastline is enormous. And the Prime Minister should know, because whenever he flies across to Western Australia, in his Airbus, he knows he has to travel for a very long time, and then when he refuels his plane and heads on up north he knows , when he looks out the window, that it's a long time, that several hours go by. As he looks out the right-hand side of his Airbus, he'll see that he's still got the Western Australian coast on his wing, because it is a very long coastline. Therefore, it requires a significant investment in surveillance, in air-flight hours, to survey the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But because of the reduction in budget, because of the reduction in operational hours for those flights that are going up and down there, we've seen some arrivals, and this Prime Minister is the only one who is to blame. Prime Minister Albanese's heart is not in Operation Sovereign Borders. The Albanese government dismantled the coalition's Operation Sovereign Borders after the 2022 election by removing the temporary protection visas. That's what they did: they removed them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And just recently, on 16 February, in our home state of Western Australia, in the northern Kimberley, we saw illegal boat arrivals simply land onshore and begin wandering around the town site of Beagle Bay. Now, I commend the community of Beagle Bay. They made sure these arrivals were watered, fed and cared for while the police were called to come, and it took some time before they arrived. They did what they needed to do as good citizens, but the government didn't do what it needed to do to ensure that there was surveillance to make sure that that boat never arrived on that shore. And we don't know the character of the people or what could have happened if people who had malfeasance in mind had arrived. That community was unprotected. It's a beautiful part of the world, but it is a serious issue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is hardly surprising that this government is failing in this area. Maritime patrols and aerial surveillance have dropped under this government's watch. These are the hours that I'm talking about here. There was a 20.7 per cent decrease in aerial flying hours in 2022-23 compared to that of the previous year and a 12.2 per cent fall in maritime patrol days in 2022-23 compared to the previous year. The people on the other side stand up here in this place and say: 'There's no change. It's all the same. It's exactly as the previous government was doing.' But your data doesn't back that up. The evidence is clear. It's a big coastline, as I pointed out. You need aircraft to fly over it. You need boats out there to go past it because it's so easy. It shouldn't be easy if you're committed to it, but, because your heart's not in it, it seems like it's a sieve that's leaking. You've got to get serious, government, because it actually matters to Australian security.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to take note of the response tabled earlier today on the new fuel or vehicle emissions standards. While the government has a lot to hide on its plans to jack up car prices across Australia, it has decided to introduce the world's most aggressive emission limits on vehicles here in Australia that will penalise all Australians that are seeking simply to buy a car for their families, some to just go about and do their jobs as trades men or women or farmers or miners—people who have to have large vehicles to make money for their families and for our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government continually says that these new emission limits, these so-called new vehicle efficiency standards, will not raise the cost of cars because there is a similar scheme that operates in the United States. They have said this on repeat. It's obviously something in the first line of the talking points that have been provided by the minister's office. I doubt many of them have actually looked at what has happened in the US or how their scheme works. It became clear at Senate estimates a couple of weeks ago that the system the government is proposing is very different from what has operated in the United States.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is proposing a reduction in emission limits for Australian vehicles of more than 60 per cent over the next five years, so emission limits have to come down by more than half over the next five years. In the United States, in the last five years their scheme has only reduced emission limits by 25 per cent, so our scheme is double the impact of the US just to start with. On the other side of it too, under the government's scheme, car manufacturers will pay a penalty if their cars are sold above the limit. Of course, those penalties will be passed on to you as the consumer. The size of that penalty under the government's scheme is $100 per gram of carbon dioxide over the limits. That fine is actually three times the level that has applied in the US to date. On top of that, on another side of things, in the US, large vehicles like the RAMs and the F-150s that a lot of trades men and women use in the US are exempt. They're exempt from the US scheme! Here in Australia, your four-wheel drives, your LandCruisers, your Ford Rangers and your Toyota HiLuxes are all under the scheme. The government's distraction here—'Just look to the US'—does not hold water at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Senate has asked the government to produce the documents and produce the modelling associated with their proposed scheme so we can actually see what the impact on car prices will be. But, surprise, surprise, the government is refusing to release this information because, they say, it's a cabinet document. It's part of cabinet deliberations. This is a total abuse of the Senate's powers. It's an abuse of the orders that have been previously decided upon in this place. A government cannot and should not be able to just declare that any document is a cabinet document and therefore keep it hidden from the Australian people. This is simple. All we're asking for are the calculations that have been done to show the effect of the government's scheme. There is nothing secret here. There is nothing of national security interest. This material was funded by taxpayers and should be able to be viewed by taxpayers. There is no justification to keep it hidden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the limited time I've got, I just want to demonstrate why the government is keeping this hidden. The most popular car for sale last year was the Ford Ranger. It emits 188 grams of carbon dioxide a year. The government want to impose a limit on this car in 2029 of 81 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre. The Ford Ranger will be 107 grams over the limit. At a charge of $100 a gram, as I said earlier, that works out to be $10,700. These are the government's own figures. They're very simple calculations. We just want to see the modelling. There is a little bit more complexity to this, which I'll come to, but it's $10,700 extra that people will be asked to pay for a Ford Ranger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, a lot of people out there in our community have to buy a Ford Ranger. They have to buy a ute of that sort of size and weight to do their jobs as plumbers, as builders, as bricklayers or as farmers. Some farmers will need a four-wheel drive even more. You get a bigger impact on a four-wheel drive. You need those types of vehicles. There are no EV alternatives that can suit the purposes of a bricklayer in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, the government says that the cars—the Toyota HiLuxes and the Ford Rangers—will get more efficient over time, but they won't get more efficient to the tune of 100 grams of carbon dioxide reduction. They won't get more efficient to the tune of a 60 per cent reduction. Even if they get more efficient at a reasonable rate, it'll still mean thousands of dollars more in cost. We deserve to know exactly what the government's numbers are. What has the government been told on how much the extra cost will be? If it wasn't an extra cost, they'd be releasing this modelling—no doubt about it. The only reason they're keeping it hidden is they have something to hide in their plans to make us pay more for cars.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="283585" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  I want to take this opportunity to speak on this. Just yesterday I was a guest of the Caravan Industry Association at their show down in Melbourne; I stopped in on my way from Perth to Canberra yesterday. I went and had a look at this industry. It is an enormous industry. Did you know that 93 per cent of the caravans driving around in Australia are manufactured in Victoria alone, in the suburbs of Campbellfield and Epping? It's an enormous industry, and it employs tens of thousands of people. You think of the country towns that are benefited by people travelling on their holidays, whether they be young families or grey nomads, as they often like to be called—well, maybe they don't like to be called that, but they are often referred to as that. The reality is this policy the government is bringing in is going to have a very significant impact upon that industry and upon people's lifestyles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Canavan was saying, there is no equivalent, when it comes to electric vehicles, that will be able to handle the loads required or the heavy loads on the back of a ute or on the back of a towbar, when they will be towing a caravan or boat around the country. It's just not practical. Yes, these EVs have the torque that is available, and they can tow up to, in some cases, like the F-150 Lightning, 4½ tonnes, but you can only tow for about 100 kilometres before you've got to recharge. The battery in an F-150 Lightning weighs 900 kilos. That 900-kilo battery is being hauled around, with extra wear and tear on the roads. Imagine having an accident with a car that heavy. And you know what? The gravimetric energy density of that battery is only 250 watt hours per kilogram compared to fuel, which is 11,700. So that 900-kilo battery is equivalent to 18 litres of fuel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state, where we like to go out in the great outdoors, in July it's like a great exodus from Perth; people go up north to places like Ningaloo, which is about a 1,300-kilometre drive. Can you imagine, every hour, having to pull over and recharge your vehicle. There's nothing, even on the periphery of science, of technology, that is going to see a tenfold increase in the energy density of batteries. The problem is you've got this enormous battery of about 120 kilowatt hours in an F-150 Lightning—that's a big American truck, mind you; it's bigger than a HiLux or a Ranger. Imagine having to recharge that. That's twice the size of a Tesla battery. It would take three hours to recharge that battery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we go up—and we go up most Julys and have done for many, many years; we have towed our caravan up to Exmouth—there's a fuel stop that we have to stop at, because you can't make it to the next location, between Geraldton and Carnarvon. It's called the Billabong Roadhouse. When you go up there in the middle of the July school holidays, you've got to wait about half an hour to get fuel—and that's assuming it only takes maybe five minutes to refuel a petrol tank. Imagine if the queue of cars that needed to recharge at that point all had to wait three hours. Imagine the size of the power station you'd have to build right next door to it to ensure that you had enough throughput and enough ability to charge multiple vehicles all at once. Imagine the size of the power station you would need right there; I bet it would be a diesel powered power station! It's just completely impractical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with the association yesterday. They're optimistic about the future, but the innovation that's required to solve this problem is not coming in the next two or three years. The policy that the government is bringing in is imposing the cost on purchases of vehicles in the next couple of years. There is no innovation, even on the horizon, that would deal with the very practical limitations. I haven't even talked about tradies who need to carry heavy equipment to do their job. A reason why tools are heavy is because they have heavy work to do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  I too rise to speak on this proposed legislation, which is basically a tax on productivity. It's a tax on productivity, and it is a tax on working-class Australians. Yet again, it's another one of these costs that will be passed through the economy. It's an attack on the building sector, because many tradies use utes. I'll be honest here; I'm not against making utes smaller so they fit in car parking spots. I'm not against that at all. But when it comes to taxing utes and those vehicles that carry loads and do the lifting, I have said many times in this chamber that we need to get back on the tools in this country. We need to stop the paper shuffling, the wallowing in self-pity, the indoctrination and all of this stuff and actually get back out there building houses and more factories, and this idea will only make that harder. Why? Because it's an increased tax, and it's increased regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's annoying about this is that the Labor Party and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, and the Prime Minister won't actually release the modelling that will show how much extra it will cost for tradies to go about and do their job. I don't know what's happened to the Labor Party. They used to be the party for the working class, yet we've seen over the last few decades that they've forgotten about their original base, the working-class Australians, who are migrating in droves. We saw that originally under the Howard battlers. They never forgot what Hawke and Keating did to them with the Button plan in 1985, and we're seeing this trend—the migration of working-class Australians over to the Liberal party—because we get it. We know that there is no substitute for productivity in this country and that this tax, which is basically what this proposed legislation is, is only going to make it harder for hardworking Australians, like our tradies, to go out there. God knows, we need them. We don't want any more people going to university and coming out brainwashed and broke when they're 22. We need more hardworking tradies in this country, and I fear that this proposed legislation will destroy hardworking Australians.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens don't accept the government's public interest immunity claim on documents relating to disability loadings and the funding negotiations with the Western Australian government. The negotiations on the new funding arrangements are happening behind closed doors, and after over a decade of waiting for full funding for our schools, the public has a right to know about the negotiations that are happening between state and federal governments. We think that the Australian people have a right to know the basis on which the future of public school funding in this country is being decided. Labor's track record on public school funding isn't anything to be proud of. Gillard's 'no worse off' comments, which were made very soon after the Gonski report was delivered, essentially meant capitulating to the private school lobby, nobbling Gonski from the get-go. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The deal with the WA government doesn't fill us with confidence. At the moment, as far as we understand—certainly, in the opinion of the WA Labor government—it includes the four per cent dodgy accounting tricks which enable the state of WA to count things like transporting kids to school on buses, capital depreciation of buildings and the funding of teacher registration bodies in their Gonski funding. That's four per cent of funding that will not go to students in classrooms and that is desperately needed in public schools. In estimates, the Minister representing the Minister for Education would not commit to the government removing this four per cent loophole, and on <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> yesterday the minister dodged the question. The so-called deal with WA, if it's rolled out nationally—which is what the minister has said he wants to do—would lock in underfunding for another generation of public school kids. If the four per cent loophole remains, we will only get to 96 per cent. That's 96 per cent of the money required to get only four-fifths of kids above the minimum standard.</span>

If they're going to end it, why won't they come out and say that now, and why won't they show us the documents? If they're now planning to backtrack on that promise, the parliament and the Australian people deserve to know. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2023-24 Budget, the Australian Government announced that it is investing $14.7 million to strengthen the way the criminal justice system responds to sexual assault to prevent further harm to victims and survivors. This includes an Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry into justice responses to sexual violence; a lived experience expert advisory group to support that inquiry; and a ministerial-level national roundtable to drive nation-wide, cross sector collaboration and inform the terms of that inquiry.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill expands the range of offences covered by existing protections for vulnerable persons in Commonwealth criminal proceedings. It ensures adult complainants are able to access vulnerable witness protections for offences that occurred while they were children, including crimes against humanity, war crimes and drug offences. This recognises the broad range of offences impacting vulnerable people, and that it may take many years for a victims and survivors to disclose their abuse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill introduces a range of measures to address the admissibility of evidence concerning vulnerable people. Evidence about a vulnerable person's reputation with respect to their sexual activities will be made inadmissible. Greater restrictions are also placed on sexual experience evidence, making it inadmissible except in limited circumstances and where the court grants leave. This type of evidence is too far removed from evidence of actual events or circumstances for its admission to be in the interests of justice, and can re-traumatise vulnerable persons by 'victim-blaming'. A court will therefore need to be satisfied that sexual experience evidence is substantially relevant to the proceedings, and to consider whether its probative value outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment to the vulnerable person. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill addresses barriers that may deter vulnerable witnesses from giving evidence. The new measures allow for a vulnerable person to give evidence by way of video or audio recording, and for evidence to be recorded for use at subsequent proceedings. Importantly, witnesses will not be required to see the defendant when giving recorded evidence, and it will be an offence to intentionally copy, damage, alter, possess or supply recordings of the evidence. This aims to reduce the risk of re-traumatising victims and survivors and will enable vulnerable persons to give evidence in a safe, controlled format. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Due process for defendants is retained as defendants will be provided with the opportunity to observe the evidence recording hearing (as they would be during an ordinary hearing) and will have access to relevant evidence recordings. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill supports the voices of victims and survivors by ensuring they are empowered to speak out, if they choose to do so. The Bill makes it clear that the current restriction on publishing material that identifies another person as a child witness, child complainant or vulnerable adult complainant in a proceeding does not apply to a person who publishes material that identifies themselves. The Bill will also remove the requirement for the proceedings to be finalised before such publication may occur, and clarifies the law that there is no restriction on identifying a vulnerable person who is deceased. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Not only do these amendments ensure victims and survivors are able and supported to speak out should they wish to do so, but they also present an opportunity for the public to gain a better understanding of sexual violence from the perspective of victims and survivors. Most importantly, these changes give victims and survivors back their voice, as well as the agency and power to control their own stories and experiences. Limiting this provision to victims and survivors balances providing a legal mechanism to support them to speak out while preserving the ability for victims and survivors to maintain their privacy. This safeguard ensures that the choice is that of the individual, and that they are empowered, but not obligated, to tell their story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These reforms will progress the work of the government under the National Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Child Sexual Abuse 2021-2030 and the Standing Council of Attorneys-General's work plan to strengthen criminal justice responses to sexual assault.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is an important step toward creating better outcomes for vulnerable persons in Commonwealth criminal proceedings through strengthened protections and enhanced safeguards. The amendments aim to minimise the risk of re-traumatisation, and provide greater assurance that vulnerable persons will be treated with appropriate sensitivity when appearing as witnesses or complainants in criminal proceedings. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill empowers ASQA to take decisive action against the minority of non-genuine or unscrupulous Registered Training Organisations (RTOs). The Bill targets those RTOs that use their business operations as a veil of legitimacy for fraudulent activity, or to circumvent the regulatory requirements for the delivery and assessment of VET. The Bill will enable ASQA to take swift action to deter and remove non-genuine or unscrupulous RTOs, and to apply greater scrutiny to new RTOs seeking to enter the VET sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also provides for increases to the penalties that ASQA is able to seek against RTOs for serious breaches of the Act. The penalty units in the Act have not been increased since the Act commenced in 2011, and these changes are in the view of the Government long overdue. This is designed to ensure that penalties in relation to unscrupulous or non-genuine conduct outweigh any financial gain to be had from that conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to supporting a high performing, reputable and trustworthy VET sector. The Government recognises that this sector is critical to skilling Australians, creating career opportunities and pathways to secure work, as well as delivering the skills needed to drive the economy. This is demonstrated in the landmark, $30 billion, five-year National Skills Agreement between the Government and state and territory governments that will provide the skills needed for a modern economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill represents the next step in the Government's work to protect students and build the integrity and quality of our VET sector. It follows the Government's $37.8 million investment to support ASQA's processes, as provided for in the 2023-24 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. This investment provides for an integrity unit within ASQA, significant upgrades to ASQA's digital and data systems, and the establishment of a tip-off line to detect and address unacceptable and egregious behaviour by RTOs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Working with state and territory Skills Ministers, the Government has also strengthened the Fit and Proper Person Requirements under the Act, to apply increased scrutiny on those in management positions within RTOs. This change expanded the list of matters ASQA can consider when determining if a person is fit and proper, including a new power to consider conduct that suggests a deliberate pattern of unethical behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes are being made in parallel with work underway to revise the <span style="font-style:italic;">Standards for RTOs. </span>New RTO Standards are being designed to drive integrity across the sector. These reforms will emphasise quality rather than baseline compliance, and will make it more difficult for non-genuine or poor-quality providers to comply with the new standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments in the Bill respond to integrity and quality issues highlighted in a number of reviews dating back to 2018. These reviews made recommendations to ensure students from Australia and overseas who choose to access our VET sector can be confident in the high standard of education and training delivered. These recommendations include those made in the 2023 <span style="font-style:italic;">Rapid Review into the Exploitation of Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s Visa System</span>, conducted by Christine Nixon AO, APM (known as the Nixon Review), as well as those in the 2018 review <span style="font-style:italic;">All eyes on quality: Review of the Act 2011</span>, conducted by Professor Valerie Braithwaite (known as the Braithwaite Review).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill has also been informed by the 2023 report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's '<span style="font-style:italic;">Quality and Integrity—the Quest for Sustainable Growth</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: Interim Report into International Education</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also incorporates changes from the lapsed <span style="font-style:italic;">Regulator Performance Omnibus Bill 2022 </span>(the Omnibus Bill) to improve regulator efficiency and remove areas of legal uncertainty for regulated entities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I turn now to the measures in the Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, the Bill enables the automatic lapsing of an RTO's registration where it has not delivered training and/or assessment for a period of 12 months, as recommended by the Braithwaite Review. These provisions will apply to any RTO that has not delivered training and/or assessment for 12 consecutive months. This targets the integrity risks posed by dormant RTOs that are not demonstrating a genuine commitment to education and training delivery. For example, dormant RTOs that use their registration purely for on- selling purposes will be subject to an automatic lapsing of their registration, by force of law, where they have not delivered training and/or assessment for 12 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure procedural fairness, RTOs will be able to seek an extension from ASQA in instances where the RTO has a legitimate, reasonable justification for the non-delivery of training or assessment. These extensions are for a maximum of 12 months, and will only be granted where the reason the RTO has not provided training or assessments is demonstrably outside its control. Such limited circumstances could include, for example, natural disasters such as fire, flood, or pandemic events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This measure applies to RTOs that have not delivered training and/or assessment for 12 consecutive months from 1 January 2023, in order to apply to dormant providers currently in the sector. For these RTOs, their registration will lapse on 1 July 2024 (or after 90 days following the day after Royal Assent, whichever is later). Those RTOs will be able to apply to ASQA for an extension 60 days before their registration lapses to demonstrate a legitimate, reasonable justification for the non-delivery of training or assessment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Second, the Bill will prevent an RTO from adding new courses to its scope of registration in the first two years of registration to manage quality risks to students, addressing a Braithwaite Review recommendation. This will ensure newly registered RTOs are required to focus on delivering quality training and/or assessment in the segment of the market for which they were originally approved. It will also provide ASQA with the opportunity to assess a new RTO's operations over a reasonable period, to ensure a new RTO has a sound understanding of the educational integrity and commitment required to operate in the sector, prior to expanding its course offerings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Third, the Bill expands the period within which the Regulator can conduct an internal review of decisions. This ensures ASQA can give due consideration to complex or high-risk review decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fourth, the Bill gives ASQA greater discretion in terms of how it prioritises, considers, and makes decisions in relation to applications for initial registration of an RTO. This ensures registration applications can be prioritised, such as where reputable applicants propose to deliver courses in areas of skills shortage or where there is community need. It will also enable ASQA to decide simple applications quickly and efficiently, while applying appropriate scrutiny to complex or high-risk applications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fifth, Bill empowers the Minister responsible for VET to determine a specified period where the Regulator is not required to, or must not, process or accept initial applications for RTO registration. This determination must be made in consultation with ASQA and with the agreement of state and territory Skills Ministers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This determination could be used by the Minister where ASQA identifies a trend in applications by non-genuine or unscrupulous providers seeking to enter the VET sector, for reasons other than a genuine commitment to the delivery of quality training. The determination could also be used where ASQA has received a considerable influx of applications, and the number of applications means that granting them would have a deleterious effect on the integrity, health and quality of the VET sector. The determination may apply to one or more classes of applications. This will permit ASQA to target specific cohorts of RTO applicants that pose a risk to the sector, without disrupting the acceptance and processing of other applications for registration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sixth, the Bill improves student protection by expanding offence and civil penalty provisions to cover a broader range of false or misleading representations by RTOs about their operations. This clarifies that ASQA will be able to consider broader activities that relate to a non-genuine or unscrupulous RTO's business operations, including where it publishes false and misleading descriptions about its training, or misleading images of delivery locations, premises, and facilities. It would also prohibit the publication of false testimonials. These provisions will remove impediments to ASQA taking decisive action in response to RTOs that seek to mislead students with false representations and false advertising.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Applying tougher penalties to egregious RTO behaviour is imperative to support integrity in the VET sector, and to deter those that currently see penalties as a risk worth taking, or a 'cost of doing business'. The Bill increases the maximum penalty for many of the offence and civil penalty provisions in the Act five-fold. Currently, maximum penalties for affected offences under the Act range from $9,390 to $187,800. These amendments mean those penalties will now range from $46,950 to $939,000 under current penalty unit values. These increases are focused on the offences and civil contraventions which threaten VET integrity, student protection and are otherwise indicative of practices that may be associated with non-genuine or unscrupulous providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the Bill supports effective regulation through a number of technical and administrative changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Measures previously introduced in the lapsed Performance Regulator Omnibus Bill 2022 further support efficient regulation by clarifying the use of personal information contained in audit reports, aligning registration requirements with similar requirements under the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (the ESOS Act) and clarifying review processes to better align with the internal review process in the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) Act 2011. This will ensure streamlined interactions for entities regulated by both TEQSA and ASQA under the ESOS Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The measures in the Bill, combined with the steps already taken, demonstrate the Government's commitment to lifting integrity and delivering quality outcomes for those who access our VET sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill supports the majority of providers—those who are genuine, are doing the right thing, and are in the business of education and training for the right reasons. They, along with students, industry and the whole Australian community will benefit from the removal of non-genuine and unscrupulous providers, who undermine integrity and trust in VET.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A well-regulated and trusted VET sector will strengthen Australia's ability to ensure our skills and training workforce needs are met now and into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the Bill to the chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">PASSENGER MOVEMENT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 2024</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2024 gives effect to a measure announced by the Government as part of the 2023-24 Budget. This Bill will amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Passenger Movement Charge Act 1978 </span>to increase the passenger movement charge from $60 to $70 from 1 July 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The passenger movement charge is imposed on persons departing Australia for another country and is usually collected by the carrier, such as an airline, at the time a ticket is sold, and then remitted by the carrier to the Department of Home Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Border Revenue Collection measures, such as the collection of the passenger movement charge, play an important role in advancing Australia's economic interests and helping to fund our critical border protection services, such as customs, immigration and biosecurity. This is the first time the passenger movement charge has been increased since 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the intervening period, the Government has already acted to improve the traveller experience at our border. We continue to invest in improving the performance of our airports and the passenger experience through our international airports and cruise ship terminals. This includes commitments in the 2022-23 Budget of $60 million to upgrade Hobart Airport runway and airfield facilities and $55 million to upgrade Newcastle Airport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has invested over $48 million in a range of measures to support Australian tourism and travel. These initiatives include programs to revive international travel, upskill workers, ensure quality tourism products and deliver infrastructure upgrades. These programs support the THRIVE 2030 strategy, which sets out a long-term plan for growing Australia's visitor economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This increase of $10 to the passenger movement charge is broadly in line with the increase in inflation since 2017. It will see an additional $520 million generated in revenue over the next three years. This is one of several measures the Government announced in the 2023-24 Budget as part of our Economic and Fiscal Strategy to make the economy and budget stronger, more resilient and more sustainable over the medium term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This considered increase to the passenger movement charge will bolster the Government's capacity to invest in the protection of our international border—including the Government's recent investment in strengthening Australia's biosecurity system, as well as supporting the important and expanding work of the Australian Border Force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Access to telecommunications underpins much of today's economic, social, cultural and political activity. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards and Other Measures) Bill 2023 will deliver improved safeguards for Australian consumers when they access broadband and voice services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill contains five schedules. Schedule 1, the bulk of the Bill, sets out measures to refine and improve the statutory infrastructure provider, or SIP, regime in Part 19 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telecommunications Act </span>1997. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, Part 19 provides the legislative basis for NBN Co, and other telecommunications carriers, to provide access to high-speed broadband networks across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Most changes focus on minor changes to enhance the operation of the regime, but there are a number of more significant measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, the Bill would will bring private networks in new developments, for example those operating in retirement villages, into the SIP regime for the first time. Bringing these private networks under the regime will mean that consumers living in these new developments will have greater certainty they can access broadband and voice at appropriate standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Second, the Bill will provide a mechanism for SIPs to be required to pay compensation to customers where they do not meet a standard or a rule. This will give providers an incentive to lift performance in the event that new standards or rules are implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Third, the Bill will clarify that SIPs' obligations start in an area once buildings have been constructed and someone has moved in. Currently the obligations start once a network has been installed and there can be situations where a SIP is delayed in deploying a network and this means occupants may face delays in being able to access telecommunications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fourth, the Bill will clarify the powers of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to resolve complaints about SIP connections. This will provide an additional safeguard for consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fifth, the Bill provides stricter rules when SIPs exit their service areas, meaning that there is appropriate notice given to NBN Co, as the default SIP, to arrange for continuity of service in an area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sixth, the Bill repeals an exemption from the SIP supply obligation, because there was uncertainty in the industry about how this exemption works in practice. The Bill proposes to replace the exemption with a power for the Minister to adjust the SIP supply obligation in the event a SIP is temporarily unable to fulfil the obligation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This mechanism would be delivered by legislative instrument and the Minister would be able to specify conditions that must be met, such as reporting obligations, to provide transparency to consumers and the regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 to the Bill would provide powers for the Australian Communications and Media Authority, or the ACMA, to issue remedial notices to developers who do not install functional fibre-ready facilities, such as pit and pipe, in developments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will further encourage developers to install fit-for-purpose pit and pipe and remediate it if it is deficient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 3 to the Bill clarifies the powers of the ACMA to identify carriers and carriage service providers in public reports on their performance. This will improve transparency and accountability. Carriers and carriage service providers will be encouraged to improve their performance, and consumers will have better information when they choose a service provider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 4 provides powers for universal service providers to be determined in relation to specific areas of Australia. This provides future flexibility, for example, if Norfolk Island is fully integrated into the Australian telecommunications regulatory framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 5 makes some technical amendments to legislation, including to clarify the powers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to issue infringement notices, and to clarify the maximum penalties that should apply for breaches of carrier separation rules and also the anti-avoidance measures relating to the Regional Broadband Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Taken together, the measures in the Bill will improve access to broadband and voice services for people in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with pleasure but an enormous amount of frustration that I move, along with my colleague Senator Cadell, for the ninth time to attempt to get a Senate inquiry into this very important matter for regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand here as someone who has been a longtime supporter of renewable energy. I recall being at the opening of the Woolnorth Wind Farm on the north-west coast of Tasmania, one of the very first in the country. As a supporter of the proposed Robbins Island wind farm that's currently going through its environmental approval process, I'm not someone who is against renewable energy or the importance of renewable energy and its role in the transition that the country is currently embarking on. What I am against is the complete bulldozing of this process by this government, who promised to be open and transparent with the Australian people before the last election but continues to proceed to trample on their rights, to refuse to hear their voices or allow their voices to be heard in this place through a Senate inquiry that will look into the effects of the transition. We were told during one of our attempts last year that we didn't need to worry about this: that the government had set up its own process and that Mr Dyer was going to undertake a consultation around the country to look at the effects and report back to the government. So we really didn't need to worry—there was a process in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did that process find? What came back from that process undertaken by Mr Dyer, who I met? I sat down and had a conversation with him while he was going about that process. Mr Dyer's report shows one massive fail on behalf of the government. Even the government's own report said this process and what was happening around the country wasn't working properly. This government's own report confirms that there are chronic problems, with a survey showing that a staggering 92 per cent of respondents were dissatisfied with the level of engagement from project developers. The survey also found that more than 90 per cent of people were dissatisfied with the information being provided or with their concerns being resolved. How much more damning can a government's own report into the processes that currently exist be? I've spoken to some people who, like me, are huge supporters of this process. I heard from one person involved in an organisation supporting energy transition. The route of the transmission lines across their property has been changed seven times, and the consultation hadn't been adequate. This is a farmer who's supporting the process, and this is what this government are supporting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cadell and I have tried to be very constructive with this process. We've worked with the Greens. We've spoken to the crossbench. We understand that they come from a range of perspectives, but the motions that Senator Cadell and I put up have made a very genuine attempt to be sympathetic to those concerns. Likewise, we are concerned. I have heard through evidence to a joint standing committee inquiry that the payments made to Indigenous Australians by these project proponents vary from state to state. In Queensland, a grazier will get more than an Indigenous owner will. Explain that to me. Why isn't that equal, and why is it unreasonable that this parliament investigate that? We've even been concerned about the impacts in the context of environmental concerns, which I genuinely believed that the Greens and some of the others on the crossbench—Senator David Pocock, who's opposed this all the way through—might have been interested in. When just a few weeks ago I attended a presentation in this place by a former member of the Queensland Greens, who showed the group assembled some images that had been taken on the development of some of these renewable projects in Queensland, I was gobsmacked. I've been minister for forestry on a couple of occasions. I've shadowed the forestry portfolio. I've had all sorts of accusations made against me for being a destroyer and being someone who supports the forest industry, and particularly the native forest industry, over my time in this parliament. I have not seen anything that compares to this, and it absolutely confounds me that the Greens—particularly Senator Pocock, who came in here talking about the importance of the environment—wouldn't be the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular person, who is a former member of the Greens, helped campaign to support the election of Senator Waters, so they are not a radical in that sense. But these are a couple of the points that this individual, who on his own time came to Canberra to express concerns about what's happening in northern Queensland, where there are thousands of hectares being impacted—environmental lands. This is his report: no sediment controls on the works, no erosion controls on the works, infrastructure being built in areas of concern right down the Great Dividing Range, and one project involving 1,300 hectares of prime koala habitat. I watch the ads for the WWF on television telling me that koalas might be going to go extinct and that I should donate to the WWF to prevent koalas going extinct, and they will campaign for it. Where were they? There was not one submission in the planning process for any of these developments in Far North Queensland from the WWF, the Wilderness Society, the Australia Conservation Foundation or the Environmental Defenders Office, who are being funded by this government to protect the environment—not a peep from these organisations. Not a single peep! Yet we are seeing koala habitat destroyed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me back to the question: where is the support in this chamber for these environmental impacts? We've had thousands of farmers come to Canberra on a number of occasions and come into this place to try and express their view. Their voices can't be heard. They've come from Far North Queensland to Brisbane to have their voices heard. They've gone to Sydney and Melbourne. And we've seen the results of the government's own work—92 per cent not satisfied, yet the government still has its head in the sand and refuses to allow these people's voices to be heard on the record so that we can have a sensible process for transition that is fair to the farmers, allows a sensible process of transition of the energy system, provides appropriate environmental controls and supports the communities where these things are occurring. Why won't the Greens and the crossbench support this? You really have to wonder why. There are genuine concerns by a former member of the Greens political party, who took his own time to come to Canberra to talk to us about it, yet they won't support these things. They won't support an open process that allows this to be properly investigated, and you really have to wonder why.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All that is before we get to the impact on the oceans. The government's trying to stop gas mining off New South Wales. There are probably a few seats of concern there for them. But, if you look at what's happening in Gippsland and the situation in the South East Trawl Fishery, which lands more than 20,000 tonnes of fish into the Australian market every year—by far the largest supplier of local fish to consumers in Sydney and Melbourne—that particular fishery is subject to more than 90 per cent of the marine farm impacts on commercial fishing in Gippsland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, why can't their voices be heard? Why are they being silenced by the government? Why won't the crossbenchers support the coalition in a sensible approach to considering the impacts of these developments? We have tried to work cooperatively with the Greens and the crossbench. We've incorporated their concerns into our motions, and they continue to vote against it. So, you wonder why.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And when you hear what's happening in some of those windfarms up in Far North Queensland—the fact that it's all about the money, that they're paying no tax, that they're delivering no energy but are selling the credits to the gas industry—and then you look at where the money's coming from: I mean, this environmentalist from Queensland called them carpetbaggers. And if he didn't, I will, because that's what's going on. Look at the donor disclosures, particularly for Senator David Pocock, disclosing total receipts of $1.797 million into his campaign account, half of it—$856,382—coming from the carpetbaggers in the renewable energy sector, Climate 200: bought and sold, bought and delivered. 'We want our projects to go ahead. We don't want any interference. It doesn't matter about the impact on the environment. It doesn't matter about the impact on Aboriginal lands.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who cares about the farmers? This government doesn't. They're taxing the farmers to fund the importers of biosecurity risk, so why would they worry about what's going on on their land as it is? They're buying their water back. Why would they worry about it? Government doesn't care about farmers. It clearly doesn't care about the environment. It clearly doesn't care about Indigenous Australians, despite all the claims, because they continue to bulldozer over them and refuse to allow their voices to be heard through a Senate inquiry that Senator Cadell and I have now requested, as of today, nine times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we're starting to see the evidence come out anyway. They come to Canberra, they come to the chamber, they're threatened with eviction. It's outrageous the way people who are genuinely concerned about the impact on their farms, their livelihoods, their marine environments, the environmental lands and particularly Indigenous Australians are being treated by this government, who could quite easily allow a very sensible motion to be supported and a very sensible inquiry to go ahead, particularly when its own process found that 92 per cent of people were dissatisfied with what happened. It's an absolute disgrace that they won't allow this motion to go ahead. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  This is not the first time the Senate has debated the need for an inquiry into the effect of industrial wind, industrial solar and transmission lines on rural and remote Australia. The reason is simple. As I travel through Queensland listening with my constituents, they let me know in very clear language that there must be an inquiry into this scam, into this destruction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to name and honour and express my appreciation for the people from Victoria through to New South Wales through to southern Queensland and Central Queensland and North Queensland for standing up, in rural communities in particular but also, increasingly, city folks. I want to single out two names in particular: Katy McCallum and Jim Willmott. People in this protest movement know of them, and I thank them for their outstanding work. Katy has been a real dynamo, full of information. Thank you so much.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's net zero energy transition is a complete disaster. These things are destroying Australian's productive capacity, taking a coal powered generation capacity that offers cheap, reliable, affordable, accessible, secure, stable energy to industry and to homeowners and families and turning that into a catastrophe—an economic catastrophe, an unreliable catastrophe. Jobs are being destroyed and exported to China. In January, Alcoa announced the closure of the Kwinana aluminium smelter, with the loss of 850 staff—850 jobs!—and 250 contractors. The closure was caused in part by Australia losing its competitive advantage in power. And that's extremely important. The cheaper and more reliable the energy, the more competitive and productive a country is, and the higher the standard of living and the higher the wealth for everyone. That has been the message of the last 170 years of history. And we are committing economic suicide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A report into Victoria's renewable energy and storage targets, released and then withdrawn last month, stated the following, 'Achieving net zero requires the construction of unprecedented'—there's that word again—'amounts of renewable energy in Victoria, more than 15 times today's installed renewable capacity, according to the current best estimates.' It continues, 'Analysis indicates that to meet net zero targets using onshore renewables could require up to 70 per cent of Victoria's agricultural land to host wind and solar farms.' Those are their words: 70 per cent. Well, good luck with that, because you'd be starving, watching the wind turbines not even turning and the solar panels cooking the earth. Finally, the truth is out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No wonder this Labor government is buying back water and eliminating major infrastructure in regional and remote Australia—in short, making life tougher and tougher for the bush, and hollowing out the bush. No wonder approvals are being guided through for bug and lab-grown protein. These will be our food sources, once the net zero agenda is completed. If you don't believe me, go and listen to the parasitic globalists. They've said exactly that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor government has every intention of turning the bush into one giant industrial landscape of wind, solar, batteries, transmission lines and pumped storage. It's antihuman. The minister for misery, Mr Chris Bowen, is wrecking the bush. The minister for misery, Mr Chris Bowen, is wrecking Australia. The minister for misery, Mr Chris Bowen, is killing people's lifestyles in this country and killing our futures. We've just enough land left over now to grow beautiful quality beef and agricultural products, for the billionaire parasites the Prime Minister is so fond of hobnobbing with. So they'll shut down agriculture, except for that small quantity for the parasitic billionaires—produce that will, of course, be available to the nomenklatura: the class of bureaucrats, journalists, academics and politicians who promote these measures with the understanding that they will never be restricted by them. This is the truth of the net zero agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I travelled through Far North Queensland in January and visited the areas to be desecrated with wind turbines. I learned about the aquifers that run from the beautiful, amazing Atherton Tablelands—amazingly productive land—out to the Great Barrier Reef, taking water under the sea and then feeding it under the reef as far as 50 kilometres offshore. That's a fact. These ancient aquifers will carry any pollutants—including naturally occurring arsenic—out to our beautiful Great Barrier Reef. Pollutants are being disturbed by construction of these wind turbines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw the rockslides that occurred during the recent cyclones, which residents reported as being the worst they could remember. Climate hasn't changed. That's natural, up in North Queensland, because of the wet summers. These rockslides extended from the top of the mountains to the road at sea level. This is natural in North Queensland, with beautiful mountains and lots of rain. This devastation is in an area that is part of the same mountain range where wind turbines will be erected. So they're going to loosen the mountain tops. If the government is not getting up there with seismologists and surveyors to see what caused these rockslides, then the outcome will be more devastation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been too much looking the other way or turning a blind eye, and too much wishful thinking, in the planning for net zero. There's been too much blindness—people groping around in the dark, ignoring the data. This inquiry will be a chance to ask hard questions about the real environmental and financial cost to Australia and the real impact on regional, rural and remote Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to read from some notes. I want to honour and appreciate Steve Nowakowski. He was in bed with the Greens. He's a dedicated conservationist, which made him wake up to the fact that the Greens are not conservationists; they're just antihuman. He had courage. He was a booth captain with the Greens during their election campaigns, very much pushing their agenda, but he had the courage to inquire, to ask questions and to change. He had the courage, once he woke up, to oppose, to get the data and to tell the truth. Steve Nowakowski had the courage to speak out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has never been any data from any government agency anywhere in the world, nor from any institute or university, that shows the underlying logical scientific points and empirical scientific evidence to justify this climate fraud. There has been no data for solar and wind. The CSIRO's GenCost, as other senators in this parliament have attested, is a complete fraud. It is fraudulent. They're basing their conclusions on false evidence, false data. They've fabricated it. They've omitted solid cost data. That's because what they want to show is that the government's policy of solar and wind is the cheapest. Solar and wind are not the cheapest; they're by far the most expensive. First comes hydro, second comes coal, third comes nuclear and then way, way behind come solar and wind.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I rise today to speak to this motion about the impact of transmission lines. It's the kind of motion that we've come to know as 'Transmission Tuesday'. But, today being Monday, I'm going to rename this motion 'Mathematics Monday', because for too long we've been told that we have to follow the science, but there's never any attention paid to the actual mathematics that underpins the science. If you look at all the great scientists, they're actually famous not for their theories but for their mathematical algorithms or the constants that they came up with. Whether it be Einstein and his E=mc2, Planck and his E=hv, Avogrado's number, Planck's constant or Wien's law, all of these guys came up with a number. So today I'm going to look at the numbers behind the claim. The reason I am doing this is that, yes, it's true that renewables and transmission lines will have a devastating impact on the environment and they will have a devastating impact on the cost of energy, so let's just acknowledge that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People love to conflate the issue between the science and the environment. One of our party's values is the need to protect the environment. We can tick all that off. I love the environment and protecting the environment, but I want to focus on the mathematics. Yet again, I absolutely believe in climate change, because the climate changes every day; that's called the weather. We can take that out of the equation and go back to the underlying lie that underpins the justification of this expenditure and waste of taxpayers' dollars and that will have such a devastating impact on our economy and the climate, which is the greenhouse gas theory. It's not a greenhouse gas law; it's a theory. It doesn't become a law until a mathematician proves the theory.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their theory is that an extra hundred parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere will heat up the atmosphere by one degree. Technically speaking, the CO2 has increased by 140 parts per million in the last hundred years or so, and they're arguing that the temperature of the atmosphere has increased by 1.4 degrees. Effectively, a hundred parts per million has increased the temperature of the atmosphere by one degree. Let's divide that by a hundred. One part has increased the temperature of the 10,000 surrounding molecules of nitrogen, N2, and O2 by one degree. The first law of thermodynamics, which is the science of heat, says that energy is neither created nor destroyed. It can only be transformed or transferred. What that means—ironically enough, I learnt this in maths, too, not physics—is the laws of momentum. Temperature is ultimately a measure of mean molecular momentum. If a car that weighs one tonne is travelling at 100 kilometres an hour, and it hits another stationary car that weighs one tonne, assuming no heat loss, the most that stationary car can travel is at 100 kilometres an hour. The car that hit it, if it was only travelling at 100 kilometres, cannot convert that into 150 kilometres. That is the law of conservation. Energy cannot be created. It can only be transferred or transformed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that in mind, we apply that to the molecules in the atmosphere. In order for one molecule to transfer heat to 10,000 other molecules and heat each of them by one degree, the temperature of that molecule has to be 10,000 degrees. I'll qualify that, because CO2 has a specific density of 1.53—in other words is 1½ times heavier than the combined weight of N2 and O2 in the atmosphere. I won't explain that. That's molecular weights. You can work that out yourselves. Long story short, that means that one CO2 molecule has to have a temperature of 6,600 degrees in order to transfer one degree of heat to 10,000 molecules. Here's the thing: the sun has a temperature of only 5,700 degrees Kelvin, so the greenhouse gas theory proponents are saying that the temperature of a carbon dioxide molecule actually has to be hotter than the sun. That is ridiculous. You talk about Jesus feeding 5,000 people with a couple of fish. This is like the Jesus molecule, CO2, which can transfer heat to 10,000 molecules. That cannot happen. That mathematical equation alone destroys their argument just like that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't finish there, because I'll go to the second law of thermodynamics, which says that the entropy of a system must always increase. What does that mean? It means that heat rises and heat expands. The greenhouse gas theory has this idea that somehow heat gets trapped in the atmosphere. It's like a blanket in the atmosphere that traps heat. That's not true. It is true that CO2, carbon dioxide, absorbs radiation and photons—I'll come back to that with a third thing I'm going to. But right now there is not a solid object in the atmosphere that traps convection. Yes, CO2 does absorb and emit photons, but it does not trap convection. A greenhouse gas, for example, will allow sunlight in. The air will heat up. It will rise, but it cannot rise outside the greenhouse. Eventually, the heat gets trapped at the top of the greenhouse. Overnight it cools, and then the hot air condenses back into liquid and it goes back into the plants. There is nothing that traps heat in the atmosphere other than gravity itself, which I'll talk about later. We know that. The evidence of that is the fact that the height of the troposphere at the equator is 16 kilometres. The height of the troposphere at the poles is only six kilometres. Why is the height of the troposphere at the equator so much higher than the height of the troposphere at the poles? It's because it's hotter at the equator—because heat does not get trapped; it rises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to the first law, imagine a carbon dioxide molecule. We've seen what happens when steam runs out of a jug. When the jug boils, the steam comes pouring out of the jug because hot air goes from hot to cold. If you have a shower and you keep the bathroom windows closed, the room steams up. If you open the windows, the heat runs out. It's like having a shower down at the beach or when you go camping. You don't trap the heat; it just disperses into space. You've got to remember that outer space is a very, very big place. The temperature in outer space is actually 2 degrees kelvin, or minus 270 degrees. It is constantly sucking heat out of the atmosphere. This idea that somehow heat gets trapped by CO2 is complete rubbish, because CO2 is not a solid object. It cannot trap conduction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken about conduction and convection—the first and second laws of thermodynamics. I'll now speak about the third way in which heat is transferred, which is radiation. I will quote no less a figure than Albert Einstein himself who said, on page 14 of his 1917 paper, that radiation is so insignificant that it drops out as compared to other forms of heat transfer. What he means by that is that radiation is next to nothing. So, if I walk out one sunny day and I feel a bit of heat on my face, that's radiation. But radiation does not have the same force as a flood or the wind, as anyone can tell you who has seen a cyclone and has seen the impact that the wind can have, or who has seen the impact of conduction when we have a car accident or some form of physical contact, which is conduction. That's Einstein proving that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go further into radiation, because this is the argument they love to confuse people with. I'll admit that the greenhouse gas theory is based on a partial truth. It is true that CO2, carbon dioxide, does absorb radiation. But here's the thing. Every molecule has a certain number of vibrational frequencies. That's based on the number of atoms in that molecule. So CO2, because it has three molecules, has four vibrational frequencies. Those frequencies are at 2.8 microns, which is incoming radiation, an asymmetrical mode at 4.3 microns and then two outgoing modes—two degenerate modes—at 14.8 microns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The interesting things about this is that it is true that CO2 absorbs the photons that travel with these particular frequencies. The best way to imagine this is to think about learning to surf. In order to stand up and catch a wave, you've got to be paddling in the same direction as the wave, and you've got to be travelling at the same speed in order to get on the wave. That's how it works with radiation. Radiation is transparent to most molecules, unless it's travelling at exactly the same frequency. We know that CO2 absorbs incoming radiation at 2.8 microns, and we know, because of Planck's law, that it also absorbs outgoing radiation at 14.8—let's just call it 15 microns. Again we rely on Planck's law. Max Planck was one of the great scientists of all time. He came up with his theory and said the energy of a wavelength is inversely proportional to the width of the wavelength. Because the incoming radiation at 2.8 is much smaller than the outgoing radiation of 14.8 microns—14.8 divided by 2.8 is about five—the energy absorbed by CO2 on the way in is actually five times more powerful than the energy absorbed on the way out.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see that, again, if we look at the equator. The maximum temperature around Singapore, for example, is around 37 degrees. Interestingly enough, I did a post on this back on about 15 or 16 September 2022, where I pointed out that the maximum temperature of Singapore was about 35.6 degrees. Suddenly, within a year of posting that, the all-time record maximum temperature of Singapore is now 37. But, if you look at maximum temperatures of cities around the equator, they will be around that 35- to 37-degree mark. If you compare that to the inland temperatures here in Australia—for example, in Wilcannia—it's closer to 50 degrees. So we know that cities that have high humidity—that is, lots of water vapour in the air—actually have cooler maximum temperatures. But you don't just have to look at cities. You can look at coastal locations. We know that cities that are on the coast tend to be milder and have cooler maximums, albeit that, I admit, they have higher minimums as well. So the water vapour and the greenhouse gases tend to modulate the temperature because they are constantly absorbing and emitting photons. But let's not forget the second law of thermodynamics: it is much harder for an atom up in the air in the cooler parts of the atmosphere to emit a photon downwards, because it's warmer, because heat always travels north. So most of the photons emitted by CO2 will actually still rise.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And let's not forget the first law of thermodynamics: if a CO2 molecule does absorb a photon and absorbs energy, it's not stationary; it's not going to sit in the same spot. If it gets more energy it's going to heat up, and it's actually going to rise by itself. This, yet again, is another thing that invalidates the greenhouse gas theory.</span>

I actually asked Larry Marshall, the former head of the CSIRO, if I could have the model that the CSIRO used to calculate net zero, because, being the accountant that I am and being anally retentive, I wanted to drill down into the detail of how we calculate net zero, because I'm of the belief that we actually hit net zero about four times over, thanks to the great work of Ian Plimer, a renowned geologist who understands how the Earth genuinely works. So I already think we're being ripped off.</span>

And he goes, 'Well, there are 40 different models.' 'Oh!' I said, 'If there are 40 different models, how can the science possibly be settled?' And he said, 'Well, it's different in the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere,' and all this stuff—the verbiage started. But here's the thing: if the science is settled, why are there 40 different models to calculate net zero? I thought that if was all settled there'd be one model.</span>

Are you seriously telling me that the downwelling radiation from greenhouse gases is over twice what we get from the sun, which actually emits ultraviolet light as well as visible light, which has energy levels that are between 100 and 1,000 times greater than infrared and longwave radiation? This sort of stuff is absurd. The key point here is always to follow the mathematics or the stoichiometry.</span>

It's mass times acceleration. What's acceleration in the atmosphere? It's 9.8 metres per second squared. That's constant as well. So mass is effectively equivalent to temperature.

It's 92 per cent; 92 per cent of respondents were dissatisfied with that level of engagement. The percentage of respondents dissatisfied with the explanations provided by project developers in response to their questions—these are community members raising legitimate questions—is 85 per cent. This is on page 8 of this report. The percentage of respondents who stated that the information they received from project developers was not relevant to the concerns that they raised—and we in this place are all accustomed to that; getting an answer to a question you never asked—was 89 per cent. That's nearly nine in 10. And the percentage of respondents who stated that their concerns were not addressed in a timely manner was 85 per cent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are compelling results from the survey. It is for those people, the people who responded to this survey—community members in rural and regional communities—that we should have this reference inquiry. Their responses are the reason. I cannot for the life of me understand how you can stand in the way of a references committee inquiry given those responses.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another survey in this report also leapt out to me and was deeply concerning. Listen to this: the percentage of community members who believe the local community would benefit from large-scale community projects put in their community is nine per cent—that's nine per cent or fewer than one in 10. Five per cent strongly agree, four per cent agree—that's fewer than one in 10 of those community members who are impacted by the policies made by the Commonwealth government and the state government with respect to these large renewable energy projects. Only nine per cent of local community members think the community will actually benefit from them, and you don't want to have an inquiry? When you are faced with the survey results, you don't want to have an inquiry? Seriously? Seventy-one per cent strongly disagree that their community will benefit. More than seven in 10 strongly disagree, and if you add 'disagree' the figure goes up to 83 per cent. Eighty-three per cent of the community members do not believe that their communities will benefit from these projects. In the face of those statistics, seriously, you don't want to have an inquiry?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech in this place, I talked about the need to make sure communities impacted by policies made in this place should be consulted in relation to those policies, whether they're mining projects or renewable energy projects. Whatever sorts of projects they are, it is one thing for this place to pass policies and impose the outcomes of those policy decisions on local communities, but if we're going to do that then those local communities should have opportunities. The local communities in Queensland who are impacted by these large-scale renewable energy projects have a right to have their voices heard. It is a travesty that Labor and the Greens are blocking community members in Queensland from having the right to have their voices heard in relation to these large-scale renewable energy projects being constructed and proposed in their local communities.</span>

Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I really do say to those sitting opposite—to the Greens and the rest of the crossbench—you should really reflect upon whether or not you want to continue standing in the way of the establishment of this references committee inquiry. The results of this community engagement review, which were referred to last year on one of the previous eight or nine occasions—is it nine occasions, Senator Cadell? </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  Senator Scarr, you broke Scarr's law right off the bat! I will try to be an exception as well, Senator Scarr—I certainly don't intend to take the full 15 minutes, but I think it is very important reflecting on my role as a senator from Western Australia, particularly as a senator who focuses on everything outside of Perth city.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The really serious concerns that people in regional Western Australia and Australia have about this move—let's call it the 'transition'; that's what the government wants to call it—to put thousands and thousands of square kilometres of activity into regional Australia—22,000 kilometres of transmission lines, thousands of wind turbines and thousands of solar farms—not to power the bush, not to power jobs in the bush but basically to power our cities. Our regional communities, our farmers, are being asked to bear the burden of these new forms of electricity generation, but they're not being allowed to have a say. They're not being allowed to comment. Perhaps even more shockingly, in this place Labor, the Greens and the crossbenchers are not even allowing them to have their say via a committee inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cadell and Senator Colbeck have put up this motion nine times. Every time I speak on this, I'm shocked that members of the Senate who take their role seriously would vote against a very nonpartisan worded inquiry into the impact of new energy developments in regional Australia. This is not an area of partisan conflict; this is about local communities being able to be heard. This Senate, through its committee system, has a right to look into those communities and to hear their voices as we put in place the frameworks for these massive changes to our energy grid, the cost of which—and when I talk about cost I don't just mean dollars and cents; I mean the impact on the environment, the impact on landholders and the impact on communities—is being borne by regional Australia. You don't put 22,000 kilometres of transmission lines through the middle of Sydney; it just can't happen. The transmission lines are running from the bush into the cities. They're impacting people who live in the regions. The developments, the wind farms, the solar farms—these are not going to be plonked in a suburb of Sydney or Melbourne or Perth; these are going to be put into our regional centres, and not in very remote communities because the cost will be too high. Even if they were in very remote communities, those people have the right to be consulted as well. And this Senate has the right, and should take the right, to look into these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that those opposite, with their alliance partners the Greens and the crossbenchers, continue to block what is a very straightforward inquiry, the likes of which this Senate passes almost literally on a daily basis—this one is a bridge too far for some reason. This one is a bridge too far for the government and the Greens because they know there's a lot of disquiet out there. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Western Australia there is a proposal for an offshore wind farm along the coast, basically between Perth and Bunbury. It is a magnificent stretch of coast that Western Australians love. Many of them choose to live along that stretch of coast. I suspect, if that proposal ever gets closer to being developed, there will be a significant amount of community concern, because I've already talked to people in those areas that will be potentially affected and they are very concerned. They want their say. They have a right to have their say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All this motion from Senator Colbeck and Senator Cadell does is set up an inquiry. It doesn't force the government to do anything. It doesn't force the Greens to do anything. It doesn't require that particular issues be canvassed—though it has terms of reference. But they're broad terms of reference. They're very standard terms of reference for an inquiry of this sort. Yet Labor and the Greens keep on blocking it. There is only one reason, and that is that it is about politics. It is about the fact that Labor and their alliance partners, the Greens, know that communities are deeply concerned about these projects and want their say on how they will work and how they will look, and to make sure the costs are not borne unfairly. Communities want to make sure that all the costs are not borne by regional Australia, that costs are actually spread out and that regional Australia is looked after.</span>

We've been here many times, and it is disappointing how close we've been at times. It wouldn't be right to name things spoken of outside this chamber, but at one stage we got to an amendment that would have seen coal seam gas and things like that on people's properties thrown into the scope of this as something we agreed to. An amendment was going to be put, we were going to vote for it and that vote would have got this across the line. It fell short and never happened—it was backed out of—so we're here again today. Senator Scarr sat here and very eloquently went through the reasons: 77 pages of shown failure in the Dyer report.</span>

If I had a product and it had an eight per cent approval rating, in terms of benefits to the buyers, it would be put in the bin. But what is being done with this policy? It is being accelerated. It is being fast-tracked and rammed down throats.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not pretend that the government is afraid of what the report will say. The committee we're sending it to will sit there and go through this. No particular group has a majority. The committee will go through the process. The government are scared of what will be said in evidence to it; they're not scared of what the report might say. They'll be scared of even hearing the story. As parents, sometimes we protect our kids from nightmares. We protect them from bad stories, from monsters and from the bogeyman. But this is the people of Australia, and they are being prevented from being told the truth because of the fear of what that truth holds.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard about the numbers. Ninety two per cent of people fear that the consultation on this process isn't good enough. Only eight per cent or nine per cent think that their community will benefit from these programs. A report hidden in Victoria says that 70 per cent of agricultural lands will disappear to build these things. We had a motion today talking about stopping PEP-11, where we might see four gas rigs off the coast of the Hunter. In that corner of the chamber there was consternation that four gas rigs might be off the coast pumping gas. But instead, we're hearing that 400 wind turbines, 280 metres tall—when offshore wind has never been commercially viable anywhere in the world—is a good thing. This is the hypocrisy of this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear that out in the Central West and Orana area there are kilometres of lines going through revegetation areas. They're going through family farmlands. They're going through important environmental lands where people have been denied the ability to farm for years because of the state of those lands, but they're okay for transmission lines. In Oberon, we're seeing towers being put on top of cliffs 600 metres tall—another 285 metres on top of that—almost a kilometre above the mean ground level, and that is okay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen former senator Bob Brown come out against these wind towers. We've seen other Greens campaigners come out against the transmission lines because they see what's happening. That is the evidence. They hear fear coming from the people. In the Illawarra they hear about the offshore wind down there coming forward. We're hearing about a political decision in relation to VNI West, where I'll be in a couple of weeks, to move the line hundreds of kilometres away because it suits some politicians, but it doesn't suit the landholders. All through the New England in New South Wales there are windfarms and wind factories going up everywhere. This is the whole point. They call them windfarms because it sounds nice. They are industrial installations in rural areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These people cannot have a voice for the fear of truth in this building—not fear of a report or fear of legislation, but the fear of truth. Have we become so brittle in our country now that we can't hear those truths? Never mind doing anything about it. Have we become so fearful that we will not give those people a platform to speak their truth? I ask that for all the people I talk to throughout New South Wales—from New England, through Port Stephens, through the Illawarra, out in Oberon, and out through Orana and the Central West. That is all they are asking for at the start, and we can start finding solutions. This is what we're not looking at. Anyone can find a problem. Some of these people have solutions. The way we negotiate the land, the way we acquire land, the height of these wind turbines, the distance from houses, the distance from property—all of these things are thought through. Instead of acquiring an access lane that comes through and takes up the land, can we acquire the whole property and the value and the business for a cheaper rate than diverting the line, for example? All of these things have to be thought through. We have to become a parliament of solutions. This is hard; we get it. But some of these solutions may be contained there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion will not go to a vote tonight. It will go to a vote later this week. And I would ask that we walk in to hear some truths. I have not come in here casting aspersions here and there about what money is here and what money is there. That will happen. This process will happen. In terms of environmental impact statements, a 28-day period to study 900-page documents is not enough. Getting black paper bags with compulsory acquisition notices on your fence and gate is not good enough. Not having a say on how this happens—because we're using the state compulsory acquisition laws that are not 'just terms', like the federal law—is not good enough, nor is promoting this race to programs. I sit in here and I hear very good arguments when the people who are against nuclear say: 'There is not this built in the world. It doesn't exist. You're making something up.' But, on the other side, there is no commercially viable floating offshore wind farm in the world. There is no commercially viable green hydrogen electrolyser in the world. But we have to take their word for it that that exists. I am prepared to take a leap of faith on those things, but we can't take a leap of faith on reading these people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not conflating numbers. There weren't thousands out the front; there were hundreds out the front. There were large numbers out the front on this, but the number in Mr Dyer's report doesn't lie. It represents the thousands of people that didn't come here and who couldn't come here because they're trying to make a living on the farm. Let's just stick with those numbers. Ninety-two per cent say this is failing as a process. Only eight per cent see real benefit to their communities of this process. That's not even a consultation. Seventy-seven pages of failure is the result of the report we were told we were waiting for here, yet the answer is the same—no to this study. People can argue that this is about politics, but the 'no' is about politics as much as the 'we want it' is about politics. We don't want to hear that the disaster story is about politics, because it might interrupt a program we're happy with. No-one is thinking about the improvement it can make to that process. No-one is thinking about doing this. Australia is a big country. There's room for everything, except that our policy seems to be punishing Australians for others. And, if we are a chamber that cherishes truth, if we are a chamber that cherishes Australians, we shall stop, think about this, invite these people to our building and ask them, 'What can we do better for you?

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:44</span>):  I like cutting taxes. I think cutting taxes should be the national pastime of Australia. I think cutting taxes should be in the Constitution. I welcome the Labor Party to that moral obligation which is cutting taxes. Cutting taxes is all about handing back to Australians money that they have worked so hard for. It's not the government's money. It's not Canberra's money. It's not the politicians' money. It is the money that belongs to hardworking Australians. So, when you cut taxes, it means hardworking Australians can keep more of their money. They get to decide how their money is spent. So I welcome the Labor Party to the giant jamboree that is the tax-cutting party, the coalition. It is about freedom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is disappointing, though, is that we have a Greens party who not only don't want to cut taxes but want to increase taxes on hardworking Australians. Otherwise, how are you going to fund all of their promises? For all of those people thinking about voting for the Greens because they're promising you free dental, free medical and a holiday to the UK every second year, where's that money coming from? That money isn't free. It's not at the bottom of the garden on the money tree that's been grown by the Greens. It's coming from the taxpayers of Australia. Be wary of the Greens and the promises that they make in relation to financial and fiscal rectitude. Remember that the Greens are the party who go around talking about the housing crisis in Brisbane yet, every time someone wishes to develop houses or housing estates in Queensland, are the first to complain about that housing development. The Greens are harbingers of doom when it comes to housing in Queensland, because they don't have any solutions. All that they have are half-baked promises and complaints about other politicians. I wish the Greens would wake up one day to the reality that is modern Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome that the Labor Party have decided to cut some taxes, but what I don't welcome is the manner in which the Prime Minister of this country has dealt with this issue. What we are debating here today may be called the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, but the subtext of this bill is about the nature, the beliefs and the values of Prime Minister Albanese, someone who looked down the camera at Australians and said, 'My word is my bond.' There are certain unparliamentary phrases that I'm not allowed to use in this place, but it is clear that the Prime Minister was not telling the truth when he made that statement. We have a Prime Minister of this country who has misled the Australian people in relation to the stage 3 tax cuts. We have a Prime Minister of this country who has misled Australians in relation to power bills. We have a Prime Minister in that party who promised 97 times before the election that they would cut power bills by $275. No-one's power bill in this country has gone down by $275. In fact, everyone's power bill in this country has gone up by multiples of $275 because of Labor's mismanagement of the economy and the energy market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what this debate is also about. It is about the cutting of taxes. It is about the calibre of the Prime Minister. But it is also about cost of living—three words that the Labor Party did not mention at all last year. There were questions put to the Labor front bench by the coalition front bench concerning Labor's approach to, or failure to deal with, cost of living. But Labor, sadly, were focused on wasting $450 million on a divisive referendum that left this country in a worse place. It was not until the Dunkley by-election was called that Labor realised that they'd better do something about cost of living, that they'd better do something about those who live in the electorate of Dunkley whose No. 1 issue is cost of living. That is why Labor have moved on these tax cuts. It is a political response; it is not an economic response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stage 3 tax cuts were legislated. Labor are proposing to make changes to the stage 3 tax reform agenda. And it's not about economics. It's not about what's good for the economy, with Labor; it's about pure politics. For example, the Treasurer of this country confirmed, several weeks ago—in an interview that can only be politely described as a train wreck—that the government didn't want to wait until after the Dunkley by-election to make these changes. We have a prime minister who, several weeks ago, was calling upon the coalition to vote against these tax changes, because, you see, it's all about politics with the Labor Party. It's not about what is good for Australia. It's not about what is good for the people of Dunkley. It's not about what is good for the long-term economic future of this country. For Labor, it is all about the politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cost of living has suddenly become an issue to them. They've been briefed by Labor headquarters. The secretary of the Labor Party has walked into the caucus room or the cabinet room and briefed them that cost of living is the No. 1 issue and they'd better do something about that. That's why we are dealing with this legislation today. It is a political response to a cost-of-living crisis that, sadly, this party opposite and this government opposite have wilfully ignored for the last 18 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who speaks to the people of Queensland—anyone who goes to the roadhouses, the cafes, the pubs and the small businesses, and anyone who goes to community meetings—will know, before anyone actually opens their mouth, what the No. 1 issue is. And it hasn't just erupted as an issue in the last month or so. It has been consistent for the last 18 months. Consistently, across Queensland, the No. 1 issue is the failure of the federal government to understand the cost-of-living crisis impacting on Queenslanders, whether that's when they're going to the fuel browser to fill up, or when they're at the supermarket and looking at how much groceries cost, or when they're getting their bills for power or insurance. But what we get from the government opposite is a political response, through this proposed legislation, as well as a catastrophic failure to understand how tough it is out there and a version of Marie Antoinette's 'Let them eat cake.' From the Labor Party, we hear, 'You've never had it so good.' Well, I challenge the Labor Party: you go to Warwick, to Inala or to Ipswich, and you tell those people there, 'You've never had it so good,' and you'll get an answer that you may not like.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  People in communities across the country have been calling for the stage 3 tax cuts to be redesigned since before the election. People knew this was a bad idea. And this has only got worse. We've seen a large proportion of people who would have benefited from these stage 3 tax cuts actually now saying, 'This is not the right direction for Australia.' The majority of Australians have a strong sense of fairness and believe in looking after each other. Reflecting what Australians believe and what we've been hearing from our communities, the crossbench have consistently called for a redesign of these cuts. We've been calling for the cuts to be made more equitable since before the government started saying, 'Our position on stage 3 has not changed.' I applaud the government for doing the right thing in the end, and I applaud both the major parties, Labor and the coalition, for capitulating to the crossbench on this issue—for capitulating to Australians on tax reform, on changes that do not make sense for our circumstances and do not make sense for the future that Australians want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen Independents in this place speaking up on behalf of communities across the country, who expect more from politicians. We've heard much about how the economic conditions in Australia have changed since the original tax package was designed. It's only right that it be redesigned. With high inflation, high interest rates and housing affordability at record-breaking lows, cost-of-living pressures are pushing ordinary Australians to breaking point. The Albanese government had a decision to make: should it do what's right by our community and redesign the cuts, or should it protect its interests as a party and avoid the backlash that we're hearing from the opposition about breaking a promise? This is a promise that shouldn't have been made in the first place, but, because we're in a country where talking about tax reform is taboo and tax reform is seen as a wedge politics issue, we are in this situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that when it comes to personal income tax we do need to have a conversation around bracket creep, and I acknowledge Senator Roberts's and Senator Babet's attempts to do that with their amendments. But, as Senator Roberts has said, we need to fix the tax system. Tinkering at the edges won't have a lasting impact, and it isn't what people want and need from politicians. Senator McGrath talked about the burden that Australian taxpayers carry when it comes to tax. I think Australians recognise that paying tax in a country like Australia allows us to have the services we have. Access to health and education—although clearly much more needs be done in those areas—are part of the social contract of being part of a community, being part of a society, being a citizen of a country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are so reliant on personal income tax because we're not willing to talk about the other areas that we absolutely should be taxing. I hope that today marks some sort of turning point, the beginning of actually being able to talk about tax reform in this place. To do what's in the best interests of Australians, today and into the future, we need to debate and make informed decisions about things like the petroleum resource rent tax. The last time I checked with Treasury at estimates, offshore LNG projects still hadn't paid a cent of the petroleum resource rent tax, despite them pulling in billions and billions of dollars from selling our gas, from exporting Australians' gas. We are getting totally dudded as a country when it comes to the sale of our resources. Once we sell them and ship them offshore, they are gone. As Richard Dennis pointed out at the Press Club a few weeks ago, we're now in a situation where this year Australia will receive more from HECS than from the petroleum resource rent tax. How can we think that that's acceptable—that we're shipping Australian resources offshore and getting nothing for them?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't have to be like this. We've seen many countries do it better. People often talk about Norway. They're sitting on a $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund now. They recognised that what lay beneath the North Sea belonged to Norwegians, and they were going to tax it. They were not just going to spend it, but they were going to hold it in trust for the future. Yes, Norway, like Australia, desperately needs to stop exploring and stop opening up new fossil fuel projects, but they've got a legacy from their oil reserves. What do we have here? A couple of big gas companies that seem to have full state capture of this parliament. We see legislation come through here that is basically written by them, for them. We've got to do better for Australians. We've got to do better for Australians today and for Australians in the future, those who aren't even born yet. What kind of legacy are we leaving for them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The journalist Paul Cleary wrote a great book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Trillion</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Dollar Baby: How Norway Beat the Oil Giants and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Won </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a Lasting Fortune</span>. It's well worth a read. It tells the story of how Norway came to that position. You saw all the usual arguments that get put up here in Australia: 'Investors won't come; sovereign risk; they'll go elsewhere.' All of these things happened there. And they looked them in the eye and said: 'Sure, you can go elsewhere, but, if you want to come and take our resources, you're going to pay Norwegians for those resources. You can still make a profit, but we are going to clip the ticket on our own resources.' It's no surprise that, when the Norwegian government said that—I think it was the Labour government in power at the time—the oil companies went straight to the opposition, to the Conservative Party, and they, to their credit, said: 'We also think this is Norwegians' oil, and we're going to back this in.' And here we are in 2024, and they have a $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what are we up to here in Australia? Almost a trillion dollars in debt. We have very, very different outcomes, and yet we still aren't hearing the major parties willing to talk about the kind of tax reform that takes the burden off taxpayers. We hear so much about tax cuts. If you want to do that and still have services, you have to tax someone. The money is going to have to come from somewhere for that, for climate adaptation, for disaster relief. Should hardworking Australians also front that up? Will we have to have some sort of disaster levy on hardworking Australians who are struggling just to keep the lights on and food on their table at the moment? Or are we going to have the guts to tax the fossil fuel companies, who are making extraordinary profits?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard the crossbench talk about some sort of windfall profit tax over the last 18 months. The major parties don't want to hear about it. There are resources, and then there is a tax system that shapes the decisions that we make as people, as communities—things like the capital gains tax discount on investment properties, being able to negatively gear investment properties. The whole conversation seems to be: 'You can't touch it. You can either have the system as it is or you scrap the whole thing, and it's a disaster.' Why can't we have the debate about how we can allow people to invest in new housing stock but not in existing stock? How do we start to turn this ship around? What I'm hearing from Australians, from the people I represent, is that it's not working. As with the stage 3 tax cuts, even people who have benefited from it and continue to benefit from it are saying: 'I've got kids, I've got nieces and nephews, I've got grandkids. What kind of future are we leaving them?' So I would urge the major parties to have another look at this and actually talk to the people we are here representing. We've seen the changes proposed, and the modelling. There are tens of billions of dollars of savings, but at the same time there are a lot of people in our community who won't even be touched by these tax cuts who are currently on things like JobSeeker, Austudy and Abstudy. We should be looking at them and investing in our communities with that saving. It's a real opportunity for us as a country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This multipartisan support for a change to the tax system and to tax bands is an opportunity to continue this conversation. Yes, there are politics in it—we've seen that over the last few weeks—but we're here to represent Australians. We're not here to represent the fossil fuel industry. We should be standing up to them and taxing them, getting a return on our resources so we can potentially give some people relief, as Senator McGrath was talking about. Until we do that, it seems impossible. You have expectation of services when it comes to health and education, and some dire need to invest more in them. On the other hand we have politicians who just want to talk about tax cuts. It's going to have to come from somewhere.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KOVACIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  I rise to speak today on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024. I note the comments of Senator Pocock and I think they're important—the tax has to come from somewhere, but it doesn't all have to come from everyday Australians. This bill has been subject to a considerable amount of public debate this year, as it represents the most significant of all of the unfortunate broken promises of Albanese Labor government. There has been a lot of discussion, too, about the opposition's position on this bill. We are supporting this bill not because it represents meaningful reform for our tax system, not because it addresses the extraordinary pressure that Australian households and small businesses have endured under this government, not because of the progressive burden of bracket creep and not because it will seek to address the No. 1 problem in our economy of productivity. This bill does none of that. Yes, this bill does provide Australian families with some short-term tax relief, but this is a political response, not an economic response, from a government, a prime minister and a treasurer who are laser-focused on politics rather than on our economy and on running our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are supporting the bill currently because it would be wrong to deny hardworking Australians out there—particularly those in my Western Sydney community—some tax relief in a few months time. This is despite the fact that this government repeatedly misled the Australian people about keeping all of these tax cuts in place, both before and after the federal election. But rather than keep talking about the consistently broken promises of this government, which are effectively their trademark, I'm going to use my time here to discuss these measures and how, if left in place over the medium and long term, they will end up costing hardworking Australians and Australian small businesses even more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians know that this government has not been honest with us. We also know that these measures will increase the government's revenue by $28 billion over the next decade. This is Treasury's own data. We will all pay more. The 90 per cent of women that are often referenced in this discussion will also end up paying more. This money isn't imaginary. It's real. And that money is being taken out of Australians' pay cheques every fortnight or month or however it is that they receive their pay. That means less money to spend on ever-increasing bills that we all face, making it much harder to save for the special things that we would like to have for ourselves, for our families or for our friends, like buying some Taylor Swift tickets. Not everybody gets to go see that for free. Along with the growing plethora of new and increasing taxes across our economy, we've heard in recent days about the potential cost increase in the average family car, or a ute for a tradie. This government has only one strategy to manage our economy and the cost-of-living crisis that they have perpetuated and mismanaged, and that is to tax Australians more. What will be next? Will it be the family home? But I digress. I want to go back to the $28 billion. It is $28 billion more that will be taken from Australians over the next decade as a result of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is not serious about economic reform. I was going to say that they couldn't care less, but the more I think about it, the more I think it's accurate to say that they actually don't know what to do, in the same way that they have no idea of the devastating effects of their new IR legislation on Australian small businesses. Either way, it's a demonstration of their inability to do the job that the Australian public rightly expects them to do. At the end of the day, this bill serves one particular purpose. It is a political fix for this government at the Dunkley by-election. As a result, young Australians will pay the price. Young Australians will suffer the most from bracket creep as their salaries shift over $135,000. Young Australians are already paying extraordinary prices to rent a home. Young Australians fear that no matter how hard they work they will never be able to afford to buy their own home. Young Australians will carry the burden of the NDIS and the aged-care system into the future in the increasing taxes that they will pay. They will pay more yet again. But this should come as no surprise, because this isn't a reformative approach; it is a political approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also an opportunity lost to create a systemic improvement to our tax system by addressing bracket creep, which the original stage 3 cuts would have done. There is no-one that does not recognise that bracket creep is a problem, so why didn't this government come up with an idea of its own to address it, rather than simply removing it? Bracket creep will reduce the value of these tax cuts over time. There is no question about that. Treasury confirms it. This is because our tax scales are not indexed to inflation or to wage growth. Indexing thresholds, as an example, is a brave move, perhaps a necessary one, but it requires a government and leadership that has economic nous and budgetary discipline. Unfortunately, those are not the hallmarks of this Prime Minister or this Treasurer. This government keeps kicking the can down the road—someone else's fault and someone else's responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a response to a problem solely of the government's own making—that is, this Labor government's cost-of-living crisis, where Australians are paying more for just about everything. In Labor's first 18 months, personal income tax has risen by a record 27 per cent. The purchasing power of an Australian earning a gross salary of $85,000 has fallen by more than $7,600 since Labor came to office. Try saving when that's what you have to deal with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Headline inflation remains more than 1.6 per cent above the midpoint of the RBA's target band, with food, housing, insurance, health and education costs all growing faster than the headline inflation rate. Core inflation measures remain higher than the headline rate, and domestic, non-tradable inflation is at a remarkable 5.4 per cent. The RBA themselves have said they don't expect inflation to return to the midpoint until 2026.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past 18 months, real net disposable income per person has collapsed by 8.6 per cent. For an average income earner, this is a decline in take-home pay of just under $8,000. This is primarily being driven by rising mortgage payments, falling real wages and increasing taxes. Let's drill down on that a little bit. Someone on this annual wage would receive just $804 more under Labor's policy, or $15.46 a week. That is less than one per cent of their annual wage and returns just 10c for every dollar they have lost to cost-of-living pressures during Labor's first 18 months in office. Let me repeat that: it returns 10c for every dollar lost to cost-of-living pressures during this government's first 18 months in office. Every single one of those Australians will be worse off over the next decade. Collectively, we will be $28 billion worse off over the next decade. AMP senior economist Diana Mousina said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there is a risk that the tax changes add to inflation in mid-2024 and could challenge our current expectation for rate cuts starting from mid-year …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this bill is a short-term political sugar hit with one goal in mind: Labor holding Dunkley at the by-election. This is a political agenda rather than an economic strategy. This government has squandered the opportunity to engage in meaningful economic reform. The Treasury had this to say about our tax system:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia relies heavily on individuals' and corporate income taxes compared with other developed countries, as well as some regional competitors. Australia's reliance on individuals and corporate income taxes remains much the same as it was in the 1950s, despite the significant change to the economy. This reliance is projected to increase further, largely due to wages growth and individuals paying higher average rates of tax (bracket creep).</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Bracket creep diminishes progressivity, and exacerbates the other problems in the individuals income tax system, such as reward for effort …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's from Treasury.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Australians are paying more tax than ever before. Inflation adjusted, the average annual income tax bill per adult in 1990 was $8,220. In September last year it was $15,344. Household disposable income is also plummeting from highs under the coalition back down to the same levels as 2013, when Labor was last in office. The Business Council of Australia said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our tax base is eroding and with an unhealthy reliance on taxing incomes as well as a raft of inefficient taxes, especially at state and territory level, we are increasingly ill-equipped to meet our society's needs.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election, this Prime Minister promised a $275 reduction in energy prices, no changes to super taxes, an increase in real wages, no changes to franking credits, cheaper mortgages and no changes to the stage 3 tax cuts. The Prime Minister has broken every single one of these promises. Yet the government have been unable to deliver anything meaningful to address a cost-of-living crisis or to show us that they are capable of delivering some kind of meaningful economic reform—an absolute opportunity lost.</span>

                    </a>  This bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, is this much better—slightly better—than the bill that was first introduced by the Liberal government five years ago. The Australian Greens have been fiercely opposed to the stage 3 tax cuts from the start. We've been the only political party to consistently call on the Liberals and Labor to abandon this unfair and ridiculous policy. And finally, after years of sustained pressure from the Greens and the wider community, Labor is changing the Liberals' tax cuts—the tax cuts that they voted for when the Liberals were in office. It goes to show that pressure works. Despite this bill only being slightly better than the Liberals' version of the stage 3 tax cuts, today's bill is a win for the Greens and for everyone who spoke up for a fairer society. Together, with a united voice, we can push Labor further and faster on the issues that matter.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it's encouraging to see Labor finally accept that the stage 3 tax cuts as they were first put together are unfair, this bill will still make economic inequality in Australia worse. Under these rejigged cuts, politicians and CEOs on incomes more than $200,000 will be given three times the value of tax cuts than the average worker, whilst the lowest 40 per cent of income earners will receive just nine per cent of the benefits. And this bill provides absolutely zero cost-of-living relief for people struggling to survive on income support payments or earning less than $18,000 a year—nothing. Those people who are scraping by on income support, people who are relying on charity, friends, family or neighbours, people who are couch surfing or living in their cars or tents and people who have been evicted from their homes because they can't afford the rent get nothing. People who don't go to see the doctor or fill scripts for their meds or get mental health support because they want to afford their kids going to the doctor to get the health care they need, and people who have given up on the idea of going to the dentist and are living with chronic toothache, eventually having to have their teeth pulled out rather than filled because they've gone too far, get nothing—while I and every other politician in this place get $4½ thousand a year in tax cuts. I and every other politician in this place do not need a $4½-thousand-a-year tax cut while millions of Australians are living on income support and are trapped in poverty. Australia is in a poverty and cost-of-living crisis. People who are on income support and others without permanent work are struggling to put food on the table, to find affordable and safe housing and to pay their medical bills.</span>

This report is the culmination of a study to better understand financial stress in the current cost-of-living crisis. The Brotherhood interviewed 43 low- to middle-income people across Victoria in 2022 and heard devastating stories of how people are currently struggling to survive. And if it was bad in 2022, it is worse now. These are the people for whom Labor's so-called cost-of-living tax cuts bill will provide no relief. Here are some of their experiences.</span>

Sometimes your mental health's affected. I've learned just to stay positive because, like I said, it's very easy to hit rock bottom sometimes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These stories are heartbreaking but, sadly, they are all too common. As the cost of living soars, people are finding it increasingly difficult to survive on casual employment, leading many to rightly seek financial support from our social security system. But the current inadequacy of income support payments is leaving so many of these short-term recipients at risk of financial stress and pushing others who are forced to survive on the payment long-term because of illness, disability or other circumstances deeper into poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a clear and simple way that the Labor government could help Rodney, Grace, Bianca and everyone whose stories I've shared, and that's by immediately raising the rate of all income support payments to above the poverty line—to $88 a day. But what Labor has elected to do instead is spend a jaw-dropping $318 billion over a decade on tax cuts, the bulk of which will go to the wealthy. Despite Labor's long, rousing rhetoric on helping the disadvantaged, since they have been in government we have seen them overwhelmingly choose policies to keep people in poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last budget, Labor ignored the calls of unemployed advocates, social service organisations and their very own Interim Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee to significantly raise the rate of income support. Instead, they opted to raise the rate of JobSeeker and other working-age payments by just $4 a day. Four dollars a day isn't enough for a coffee, and it certainly won't help someone pay rent, buy their groceries or cover medical bills. Let's go back to that $4½-thousand-a-year tax cut that everyone in this place is going to get. That's largesse of $12 a day. That's three times what was given to income support recipients in the last budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor also continues to publicly support the punitive system of mutual obligations and the privatised model of our employment system. Both are expensive, largely ineffective—and harmful—elements of our social security system. And now we've got Labor pushing through a bill that provides zero cost-of-living support for those who need it most. Labor could have made these tax cuts not apply to people earning over $200,000 a year, which would have freed up billions—billions to invest in things like raising the rate of income support, bringing mental and dental health into Medicare, wiping student debt and raising student allowance, free child care and building the clean energy systems that we need to tackle the climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Anthony Albanese often speaks of growing up in public housing and living off his mother's income support payments, yet it seems he is pulling up the ladder behind him as he tinkers around the edges of income support and our tax system. Prime Minister, if you truly cared about people living in poverty, if you truly wanted to leave no-one behind and actually offer cost-of-living relief to those who need it most, you would immediately raise the rate of income support, properly fund essential services and stop giving tax cuts to the wealthy. While you continue to persist with this neoliberal ideology of trickle-down economics, the Greens will continue to call out your hypocrisy. We know that pressure works, and we will continue to fight to ensure a fairer society.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:33</span>):  I stand here today to talk about these tax cuts. The fact is that the underlying problem for the government is that this proposed legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024, is based on a broken promise. This legislation is based on a promise that both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer repeated not just once or twice but over and over again, and they broke that promise for a very simple reason. They've admitted it. The Treasurer appeared on <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> not long after the announcement and said they had to announce it before the Dunkley by-election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's pretty clear why they broke their promise. It was because they wanted a political outcome. These are political tax cuts. And they're political tax cuts at a time when Australian families are suffering. Those of us on this side of the chamber have said that over and over again, and we understand that because we actually get out and about and talk to real Australians, and they are suffering. That is why we will support tax cuts. The Liberal Party always supports people being able to retain more of their hard earned money. But the elephant in the room in the context of broken promises—ahead of a Dunkley by-election—is inflation and the pressure that inflation has put on the small businesses and families of Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a mistruth that I think needs to be cleared up in this place. We heard it a lot from the crossbench, we heard it a lot from a small number of leftwing economists, and we heard it a lot from the Australian Greens. This mistruth is that somehow inflation profiteering was driving the inflation rate, that somehow it was actually business's fault. The Treasury analysis of inflation shows very clearly that actually the largest part of the driver of inflation in this country, since early 2022, was in actual fact wage increases, something this government has been jumping up and down loudly about in this place today. But the trouble with wage increases without productivity improvements is that in the end they have a downside. Everyone loves a wage rise. There is absolutely no doubt about that. Everybody loves a wage rise probably more than they love a tax cut. But the trouble of wage rises absent productivity improvements is that in the end they can only lead to one place, and that is longer unemployment queues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wage rises without productivity improvements will lead to higher unemployment. And, as we see in these inflation figures, they will also lead to persistent inflation in the economy. And it is persistent inflation in the economy which kills people's standards of living. It absolutely undermines and destroys it over time. It does it to such a degree that a tax cut—no matter how welcome it is and how much people do like to see their tax burden go down—will be gobbled up. It will disappear almost instantaneously. In fact, it is gone before people will even get it because of the destructive nature of inflation in our economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People's purchasing power since Labor came to power has declined by around $8,000 for someone on a median income. A small tax cut does not make up for that $8,000. People's mortgage repayments—people who are on an average sized mortgage—have gone up under Labor anywhere from $12,000, $15,000 to $20,000 per annum. A small tax cut does not make up for those increases in their mortgage repayments every month, the increase in their grocery bills, the increase in the cost of putting fuel in their car or the increase in the cost of electricity—another broken promise, I might add.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, the Australian people welcome a tax cut; of course they do. But what they're facing now is a cost-of-living crisis driven onto them by a government that just does not know how to manage the economic settings they have at their disposal. In fact they are egging on the problem, because wage rises without productivity improvements will fuel inflation and will lead to longer unemployment queues. There is no doubt about that. There are external factors that can slow things down or speed things up, but there is no doubt that wages that are above the target band inflation rate will hurt Australian families in the longer term, and no tax cut will make up for that damage. In fact, no tax cut can make up for the damage that has already been done in the first 18 month of this Labor government, in terms of the inflationary effects that we've seen and the interest rate impacts we've seen over that period of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what EY's chief economist Cherelle Murphy said about Treasury's analysis:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Reserve Bank needs labour productivity to improve and wages growth to come down to hit its inflation forecast. If either of those things proves incorrect, then inflation will prove to be too strong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labour productivity needs to improve. There is no sign of that. Nothing the government has done is improving labour productivity. The alternative is that wages growth has to come down for the Treasury to be able to meet its inflation targets. At the moment, inflation is still well above the target range of the Reserve Bank in maximising wellbeing in the Australian economy. That is not just some abstract figure. Australian families understand inflation because they feel it every day. They feel it when they go to the grocery store, they feel it when they go to the petrol station and they feel it when they have to buy their kids new supplies for the school year, and the cost has gone up.</span>

                    </a>  Every Australian feels it, Senator Babet, because it is real. It is present in the economy, and it is probably the single most negative force in the Australian economy at the present moment. This government has done absolutely nothing to address it. It talks about the cost of living, but it doesn't talk about how it is dealing with inflation. It has left that up to the Reserve Bank. What does that mean? The Reserve Bank has got only one lever at its disposal—just the one. The only thing the Reserve Bank can do is increase interest rates, and that's what they did. The only thing the Reserve Bank can do is increase interest rates. Governments have choices; the Reserve Bank doesn't. The government has choices. The government has numerous levers it can pull if it wishes to impact on the economic settings—the economic parameters—of this country. The Reserve Bank has one very blunt instrument, which it had to use with full force, because it watched and it saw the government doing nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the single biggest impact: inflation and interest rate rises that accompany the inflation have been the single biggest destroyer of standards of living in this country. Households have gone backwards a long way in the last 18 months, and that is why the community is rightly sceptical of this approach which bakes in bracket creep. It bakes in tax rises over the longer term through bracket creep—something like $28 billion over the next decade. So calling this bill before us a tax cut is actually a huge misnomer. It's actually a bill to increase taxes in the longer term. It's actually a bill to entrench bracket creep into our tax system over the next decade, and bracket creep is, again, the hidden way that governments try to sneakily deal with the problems they give themselves through not being able to control their own spending and not being able to live within their means. That's why it is important, coming into the next election, that we will have a very clear plan to deal with it. I absolutely endorse that, because bracket creep, again, just undermines the living standards of Australians. Nobody can deny that. Nobody can doubt it. It's been known for decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a system where, quite frankly, the government's probably quite happy to have a little bit of inflation going on for a little bit longer, destroying standards of living, because it deflates their debt over time; it bumps up wage rises over time. They like that. They like to be able to claim higher wage rises, even though the interplay between wages and inflation is well-known and damaging. Without productivity improvements, wages going up higher than inflation can only be inflationary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And where will that lead? Senator Scarr, you said it. It has to lead to unemployment. It has to lead to longer unemployment queues. Senator Scarr, I'll put you in the bucket with me, of those of us who remember the 1970s—it's a big bucket, the 1970s—and the destructive impact of the combination of high inflation and high unemployment. It's just something that we do not want to see in this country again. Yet this is where we will head if we get these parameters wrong. If we see an inflation-wage connection where inflation is outside the Reserve Bank band but being driven by wages, we will see unemployment queues lengthening. That shouldn't be something that anyone in this place should be contemplating—and certainly should not be celebrating. It's something we should, each and every day and each and every moment, be putting every single effort into avoiding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet, do we see anything from the other side? No. We see broken promises. We see claims about addressing cost-of-living crises that add up to nothing. We see a massive decline in the standard of living for every Australian. That is something that will be to the eternal shame of this Labor government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the federal government promised—they promised over 100 times, I think it was—that they would implement the stage 3 tax cuts exactly as they had been agreed. And wouldn't it be good if they'd implemented that stage 3 tax cut? You know what? I'll go one step further. How about we cut even more taxes? We are overtaxed. We are overgoverned. That's what I think. I think tax is theft, at the end of the day. Tax is theft. Cut it back as much as possible. Reduce the size of the federal government. The federal government is far too big. The bureaucracy is far too big. The red tape, the green tape, the black tape—it is too much.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Albanese is famous for a quote. He said, 'My word is my bond.' Is it really, Mr Albanese? Is it really, Prime Minister? He then went on and did the exact opposite of what he had promised. I'm shocked—the opposite! He attempted to justify his breach of faith. with the Australian public by insisting that he was focused on helping middle Australians with cost-of-living relief. That's what happened there. It's clear that Prime Minister Albanese sees himself as some kind of modern-day Robin Hood, but it seems to me like it's a false dichotomy. You can keep your promise to voters, or you can help Middle Australia. Why must you choose between two worthy things? Why not do both? Mr Prime Minister, just do both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to suggest a third way—a way that keeps integrity intact, if you can call it that, and a way that helps more Australians with the cost of living. I have circulated, or will circulate shortly, a Committee of the Whole amendment to this bill, which will likely be moved later this week. If supported—and that's a big 'if'—my amendment will go a long way to honouring the government's promise to the Australian people. On a side note, I'd like to see all politicians stop breaking promises that they make to the Australian people. The Australian people dislike politicians, in my opinion, and there's a good reason why. It's because promises are always broken, and that's not right. It needs to stop. Stick to your promises.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The abolition of the 37 per cent tax bracket was at the very heart of the original stage 3 reforms. It had bipartisan support. It became law. It was promised repeatedly by both major parties at the recent federal election. Obviously, I'm not going to stand in the way of the government's revised tax cuts bill. I won't stand in the way of any tax cuts, because, like I said before, I hate all taxes. It's theft. Tax cuts are a good thing. But what I will do is stand firm and ask the government to honour its word.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My amendment would allow the government's proposal to pass in full without a fuss from me, but it would also ensure that the government honours its promise. My proposal is that we abolish the 37 per cent tax bracket in two years time, which is pragmatic and fair, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. It would allow sufficient time for budgets to adjust, but it would give great hope to the Australian people. How long have we been waiting for these tax cuts now? Five years or so? What's another two more years, right? For five years or so we've been waiting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government were to support my amendment, everyone would win, and maybe once again Prime Minister Albanese's word would be his bond. But let's see if the Prime Minister supports it. I doubt he will. Do you know why? Because socialism is an expensive business. That's why. You need ever-increasing amounts of other people's money. The government could boast that they went above and beyond to address the cost of living, and all of us could be saved from the growing cynicism of a public which, frankly, is sick of broken promises.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Liberals were to support my amendment, they would be acting like Liberals who truly believe in minimising burdensome taxes. They could once again work towards a 'lean government that minimises interference in our daily lives and maximises individual and private sector initiative'. If you believe their website—and I just quoted that from their website—this is what they believe in. To my crossbench colleagues: I ask that you stand with me to support my amendments, which will ensure that the government honours its repeated promise to the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long, unfortunately, our nation has been hamstrung by high-taxing, high-regulating and overbearing government from both sides—from both the Left and the Right, unfortunately. We must allow people to keep more of their money; we just have to do it. We must force our government, whichever government that is, the government of the day, to live within its means. To quote the great Ronald Reagan: 'The problem is not that people are taxed too little; the problem is that the government spends too much.' Like I said before, taxation is theft. Reduce the size of the federal government. Reduce the size of the bureaucracy. Cut red and green tape. Grab the legislative books, cut them in half and put them in the bin; we don't need them. What we need is to unleash the free market. That's what we need—more free markets, less regulation and less government.</span>

That's a pretty fundamental principle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the proposal of these bills, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024, the Labor government, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are breaking that fundamental principle. But it wasn't just broken before the election; it was broken after the election. As Senator Babet said, the Prime Minister said, 'My word is my bond.' As soon as December last year, Treasury was commissioned to do the work to reverse the stage 3 tax cuts. When the Prime Minister was asked, at the same time Treasury was doing the work to unwind the stage 3 tax cuts, whether or not the government's position was changing, he said, 'We're not reconsidering that position', when Treasury was, at that time, doing the work to change the position. How can you actually look the Australian people in the eye and say that, when you know Treasury, in the background, is doing the work to change the position that you're saying you're not reconsidering? It is just disgraceful.</span>

It really touched me that she said that representatives from the local council of Gladstone—these aren't federal politicians or state politicians—were saying:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… younger people were being forced to choose between paying their rent or seeing a GP, because there are no longer any GPs in Gladstone that allow for bulk-billing and those young people's budgets are simply at breaking point.</span>

Through 2023, the number of bulk-billing medical practices in the greater Ipswich region fell from 25 to 16—a fall of 36 per cent in 12 months in my region, the greater Ipswich region, where my office is located. That is a shameful result—the fall in GP medical practices offering bulk-billing in the greater Ipswich region from 25 to 16. And people in Ipswich are choosing whether to pay the rent or go to the doctor under this Labor government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:00</span>):  I rise tonight to highlight an issue that affects many Australians directly or indirectly—that is, the burden of taxation on many Australian individuals. I'm not going to talk about income tax tonight. We've talked about that a lot today, and people understand income tax very well. I'm going to talk about the burden of some state taxes on Australian businesses, and the irony of those on the Left, who supposedly care about people being able to get into affordable housing, when the incentives—particularly for property developers—are constantly in the negative frame because of the ridiculously high taxation rates that are charged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you an example, Mr Acting Deputy President McGrath. This is real-world. This was described to me by an individual in Western Australia a few months ago. This example is about land tax. A particular property's land tax bill has gone from $16,000 per annum to $170,000 per annum in a little over a decade. Now, for those who can work that out in their head, that is an increase of around a thousand per cent in the taxation rate on property ownership in this particular state. It is a Labor state. I'm not going to say where it is. I don't want to identify the individual involved. The point is that, over that period, the value of that land has certainly not gone up by 1,000 per cent or anything like it. It may have doubled over that 12- or 13-year period but it certainly hasn't gone up by a thousand per cent. Actually, in the last two or three years it has probably gone backwards because of where these particular buildings are located.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When those opposite and those in the crossbench wish to talk about the importance of affordable properties being developed in the marketplace, they can't just talk in isolation about the things we do in this place. They have to look at the whole ecosystem of development in this country. One clear factor having a massive negative impact on future development is state and territory governments that are legislating ridiculous increases in taxation on property owners, for the simple reason that they're a soft target. They're a very soft target. Then those on the Left wonder why there aren't enough houses and apartments being developed and built to meet demand. You don't have to look much further than the thousand per cent increase in land tax in this particular jurisdiction. That is never going to be an incentive to new development being undertaken. It's never going to be an incentive for people to see the new property developments that I assume all jurisdictions want to see. They say they want to see them but then they tax the life out of them. This isn't the way to get economic activity in this country. We need to take a serious look at the states' and territories' land tax regimes and the way they are negatively impacting property development in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:05</span>):  Scientists have been sounding the alarm about the climate crisis for decades. Despite the evidence and the real-world experience of climate disaster after climate disaster, making the reality of a hothouse climate starkly real, government after government has ignored the warnings. The coal and gas industries keep pulling the strings here in Canberra and we, the petro state, the second largest exporter of coal and gas in the world, continue to kick the scientists in the guts. Australia could be making a huge difference to fossil fuel use if we listened to the scientists and seriously acted on the climate crisis. If we were listening to the scientists, we would commit to phasing out coal and gas. We would be saying no to new coal and gas. But no, instead we are powering ahead with carbon bombs like Beetaloo and Scarborough with more than just the blessings of our government—with the active support, changing laws to facilitate them, showering them with largess in exchange for the donations that companies like Woodside and Santos give to both Labor and the Liberal Party. 'It's the economy,' we are told. They tell us that we Greens just don't understand it. Except that it is not just the economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week the UN's top climate official, Simon Stiell, gave our prime minister a very clear message: get on board decarbonising or suffer the consequences economically. As reported in the<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Age </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> today, Stiell said that Australia has more to gain and more to lose than most nations, and has a responsibility to help lead a global effort to decarbonise economies and unlock trillions of dollars needed to prepare for climate impacts. He said that, if the climate crisis continues as it is currently on track to, it will be Australia which will be front and centre in resettling entire national populations, as entire island nations that neighbour Australia will be wiped out, and our major food bowl, the Murray-Darling Basin, will be decimated. As I have said many times in this place, you cannot grow wheat in our major agricultural areas when they have the climate of the Central Desert.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's only one thing that 'lead a global effort to decarbonise our economies' means: Australia needs to get out of coal and gas—no new coal and gas. Stop subsidising coal and gas and the transnational fossil fuel companies. The UN's call to Australia was emphasised by industrialist Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest, one of Australia's richest men, who put it bluntly at the Press Club today. He said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:09</span>):  I rise to communicate to the people of Ukraine from the Parliament of Australia that we see you, we hear you and we are with you, our brothers and sisters, in the democratic struggle. And we admire you, with great admiration, from a distance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years on from Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, the carnage continues. Vladimir Putin remains Russia's president, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy continues to lead his nation in its darkest hour. Ukraine is at the front line of the democratic fight against tyranny and an archaic form of international relations that the world should have long ago moved away from. Ukraine epitomises the rules based international order that must be maintained—an order that respects the sovereignty of nations and resolves disputes peacefully through diplomacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia recognises that Ukraine's fight is our fight, too. Australia remains steadfast in supporting Ukraine to defend itself, and in holding the Russians responsible for their illegal invasion. They need to be held to account. That is why Australia has recently announced further targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on 55 persons, and targeted financial sanctions on 37 entities. The new sanctions target those involved in Russia's deportation of Ukrainian children from regions under temporary Russian control. This follows the International Criminal Court's decision to issue arrest warrants for President Putin and Russia's Commissioner for Children's Rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, for the war crime of unlawful deportation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also sanctioned targets in Russia's defence, energy, media and mineral sectors, as well as targets involved in Russia's procurement networks in Belarus, Iran and North Korea. These sanctions reflect the Australian government's position that those supporting Russia's illegal war will face consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has now imposed more than 1,200 sanctions in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Today's sanctions build on last week's announcement that the Albanese government is providing $50 million to the International Fund for Ukraine, directly supporting the procurement of priority military capabilities. This contribution takes Australia's overall support to Ukraine to approximately $960 million, including $780 million in military support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own capacity, I continue to advocate that my own government and other like-minded nations around the world expedite any assistance they can to provide support to Ukraine to finish the war and achieve peace on their own terms. In the last week of sitting in this parliament, I was visited by a delegation of Lithuanian politicians from across the political divide with one word on their lips: Ukraine. They see themselves on the edge of brutality, with Ukraine merely buying them and democracy time, under the continued onslaught of the Russians' expansionist regime. They urged Australia to continue its support and join them in that ongoing call.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are few who understand what's going on in Ukraine better than the people of Lithuania. It has only recently been three decades since Lithuania's aspirations were being stifled by the boot of Soviet imperialism, a fate shared by many others in Eastern Europe. And yet, against overwhelming odds, Lithuanians led a successful, peaceful revolution against Moscow, becoming the inspiration for a cascade of free peoples across Eastern Europe and Central Asia. While some have struggled to shrug off the Soviet legacy, Lithuania has worked tirelessly to become a shining example of democracy and the rules based international order in Europe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of the contribution from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. I thank my colleagues in the parliament for being part of that friendship group and the co-chair, Senator Paterson, for his continuing advocacy. Internationally, next month, I will be representing Australia at the Inter-Parliamentary Union, where I will meet again with the Ukrainian delegation. I will bring them Australia's— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="300644" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LIDDLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:15</span>):  Action and urgency, not announcements—that's what this Albanese government should have done in response to Australia's family violence epidemic. Instead, they spent 2023 distracted by their $450 million failed Voice, and only now do they tell us that they're focused on the cost of living. Already this year more than 10 people are dead as a result of domestic and family violence. These are Aussie families that are impacted forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no excuse for violence, but the drivers are well known and the urgency has been obvious. In a recent 12-month period, domestic violence incidents were up 20 per cent in the Northern Territory and 12 per cent in my home state of South Australia. Scratch at the rhetoric of the Albanese government and the reality of their poor progress in this portfolio area becomes clear. The 2021 election commitment was 500 frontline community service workers. The 2022 budget commitment was $170 million to get on with it. In November last year, the Prime Minister told parliament his government had delivered on that commitment. The truth is that, when the Prime Minister, who claims his word is his bond, said that, not a single worker—not one—had started work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Northern Territory, with its horrific level of family violence, only one of the 18 workers is actually on the front line. In my home state of South Australia, just one of the 37 promised is on the front line. Media reports suggest the PM is busy working on the next election, when, by any measure, his government is nowhere near delivering on this promise he made to get your vote before the last one. Senate estimates confirmed the number is two out of 500 in almost two years. At that rate, there is little hope for the national plan target of ending violence against women and children in Australia in one generation or of coming close to the Closing the Gap target of reducing all forms of violence by at least 50 per cent by 2031.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is how the Albanese government does its business in this area. Not a single frontline community service worker has been employed in Western Australia, Tasmania, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria or the ACT, and they couldn't even think to prioritise the areas of greatest need. This Labor government handed over $38 million of the $170 million to the states and territories in November, and still, four months later, there are only two. The sector was saying the rollout was such a farce and the criteria so restrictive that some DV shelter operators were not even going to bother applying. That's what they told me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sought answers from the relevant minister and from state and territory ministers, but I got nothing, because there was nothing to tell. There is no real progress to report. There is not a single worker in place. There are no new resources for a desperate sector. There is no promised extra help for women, children and vulnerable people living every day with the fear, trauma and devastation of violence. In domestic violence, lives matter. In domestic and family violence, time matters. In domestic and family violence, getting help when you need it matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflect on the impact of the lifting of alcohol restrictions in the Northern Territory before the eventual pressuring of the Territory Labor government to reinstate them. While the Albanese government took its time to act, there was a drastic spike in the rate of harm, and then there was an announcement of $400 million to respond to it. This ideology was at times cheered on by the Australian Greens. I reflect, too, on this Labor government's investment of hundreds of millions of dollars to get rid of the cashless debit card and the extra programs in Ceduna, the Goldfields and the East Kimberley that would address the social consequences associated with its removal. If you voted for the end of the card, you should visit those communities—the same ones where you don't hold federal electorates—and ask them how your handiwork is working out for those people who actually live there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With Senator Pocock, stop blocking a much-needed audit of organisations delivering Indigenous programs, despite Senate estimates confirming there's an issue with some of them. When vulnerable people don't get the quality services they need, their outcomes are worse. This Labor government's poor performance, its distraction and its go-slow has let women down. It has let children down and it has let vulnerable people down. Sadly they are the ones who bear the consequences. You need to get on with it if you're serious about ending violence in all communities. Your progress to date is not good enough.</span>
