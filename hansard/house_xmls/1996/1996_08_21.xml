If now is not the time, I hope you will make a statement at 2 o'clock before question time.

         , I was hoping that the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), might have gone just a little further—this being a suitable occasion to look at parliamentary sittings for the rest of the year. We are scheduled to sit, as I understand it, for a further 30 days, including two days this week in which debate will be curtailed because of the presentations of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in connection with the budget. The adjournment debate will not be brought on and that is standard practice. On 30 April this year the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) stated:

       <para>
        The government has also kindly provided a draft business program to all honourable members. Only a cursory glance at that would tell anyone in this place that the government cannot possibly meet its program without curtailing future debate. The draft program I am talking about does not include budget related bills. Excluding those, the government will not be able to get through its program, given 30 sitting days. It is as plain as the nose on my face. It does not sit too well with other comments of the Prime Minister, such as the statement he made on 10 February 1994 when he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have long held the view that this parliament should sit more frequently . . . if we sat closer to 100 days a year . . . I have always thought that the Christmas recess was a bit too long.

       <para>
        He said earlier in October 1993:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is no reason why the fewer than 100 days a year that parliament sits . . . should not be increased by 30 to 50% . . . None of us have a greater duty than to sit here representing the people who sent us . . .

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         then by saying, `Hear, hear!' This year the parliament will have sat a total of 53 days on the present arrangements. Even allowing for the fact that there has been an election earlier this year, if you extended the normal sitting pattern that the government is presently observing over the election period, we would only get up to around 70-odd sitting days at the very best. We have 30 sitting days in this budget session—30 by two is 60 days. That is a long way short of the 100 days of which the Prime Minister spoke and I have referred to already.

        You are not going to get that if you curtail these sittings. You know darn well you are going to have to apply the gag and the guillotine to get through your program. Why don't you be up&amp;hyphen;front now and say exactly what you are going to do? Even better, why don't you schedule in two or three more sitting weeks? That is what the parliament is for.

        We have come here, as the Prime Minister said, to observe the very noble sentiment he expressed in October 1993: that none of us have a greater duty than to sit here representing the people who sent us here. The Leader of the House, the member for Flinders, knows very well that, without the application of the gag and the guillotine, we cannot get through the scheduled business. I regret the fact most sincerely that the Leader of the House has not taken this opportunity or another one in the first week of the sitting of this budget session to schedule in adequate sitting times so that members may perform the duties they were elected to do: to represent their views as they see reasonably fit in this the major forum for the Australian people.

         —Obviously the opposition supports this motion. I think the arrangements made for tomorrow are reasonable. I just want to make a few brief remarks about the points raised by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). It is true that the expressed attitude of the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the parliament on the proper procedures of parliament that he outlined before the election now means we have another broken promise. Now he is in government he is clearly committed to the supremacy of the executive over parliament. He is substantially ignoring the parliament in breach of the views he outlined both as Leader of the Opposition and in earlier periods as a senior member of the opposition during the period leading up to the 1996 election.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not suppose that on this day after the budget of broken promises anyone should be surprised, but it is true and it is a cause for continuing concern to many members of parliament and consistently, I know, to the member for Curtin and some of his colleagues. The opposition supports the motion and considers it a reasonable arrangement for tomorrow. I know my colleague the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) will have some things to say about the overall arrangements, but let us make our judgment about whether those promises about the attitude towards parliament are kept during 1997 as we see how the arrangements for parliament for which this government is responsible unfold in a full year. I am extremely dubious that the commitments they made before the election will be kept, but let us reserve our judgment just a little more.

         —in reply—I did not speak when I first moved the motion simply because the intent of this motion is very clear—it is narrowed to the circumstances this week. It is the practice of this House to make certain arrangements for the delivery of the budget and for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to have the same right of reply. That is not curtailing debate, as the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) says. In fact, I think it is rather an important debate.

It is neither fair nor reasonable to assert that this is curtailing debate.

         We are sitting more days this year—an election year—than we did in 1993. It is quite unreasonable to make comparisons of the sitting days in an election year and those of an ordinary year. Obviously an election year disrupts the ordinary pattern of the sittings and we have had to take that into account in the usual way this election year. We have, however, consistent with our guarantee to attempt to provide people with more speaking opportunities, extended the sitting hours. We have also encouraged the use of the Main Committee. The member for Curtin also has a responsibility for the proper management of the Main Committee. It is not reasonable to be threatening the procedures in the Main Committee so as to shut it down. The Main Committee is an important forum for people to have an opportunity to speak—

        That is something I wholeheartedly endorse and agree with, and so does the opposition. This bill is a simple bill. In his second reading speech, the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General states:

        This bill allows me to authorise payments by way of financial assistance to the states and territories for the purpose of providing compensation to firearms owners and dealers. It also allows me to authorise payments to the states and territories and by the Commonwealth for purposes directly connected to the compensation scheme and for implementation of the new nationwide licensing and registration schemes. The bill appropriates moneys from the consolidated revenue fund for these purposes.

        Payments for reimbursement of compensation paid for surrendered firearms are limited to those surrendered during the national amnesty period of 10 May this year to 30 September next year, or such shorter period as I determine if any jurisdiction decides on a shorter amnesty.

        Those were the words of the Attorney-General in his second reading speech. The opposition wholeheartedly supports that. The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General also said this:

        Swift action is essential if we are to have really effective nationwide firearms laws.

        I can give the Attorney-General and the government our assurance that they do have our support to pass this bill quickly. I understand there are some minor reservations that the shadow Attorney-General and minister for justice, Senator Bolkus, will attempt to discuss with the Attorney-General in the next day or two when the matter reaches the Senate. I am sure that if there are any legitimate concerns they will be considered.

         —I would like to commence by saying that I am a person who licensed a rifle in Western Australia when I was 16. Even at that stage, I saw the weapon registered as part of my licensing requirement. I lived in the north-west and owned quite a variety of guns. In fact, in my early years in the hotel industry, I was the owner of a licensed hand gun. It is an interesting aspect of life that in those days you were entitled to license a hand gun for personal protection or the protection of cash. I used to have to transport cash from my hotel into the city each weekend night. My chances of being robbed in those days were significantly fewer than they would be today when, of course, it is considered highly inappropriate to have a hand gun for the protection of yourself or your property.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I guess that is just a commentary on the times, but I make the point that during that period I became the licensed owner of a number of firearms. Upon moving to Perth from the north-west, I surrendered nearly all of them as I thought it inappropriate to have these sorts of guns in my possession when I had obviously little use for them and they represented the problem of being stolen by someone who had the wrong intentions for them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So I am not somebody who is some sort of raving redneck when it comes to guns. In fact, it was interesting when I decided to hand in
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the hand gun. I was immediately rushed by a large number of policemen who wanted it as a collector's item and that is, I think, where it stays today. But the reality is that I have always taken a practical view on gun ownership. Guns are things that should be owned for a proper purpose. I still retain the rifle that I bought when I was 16. I seldom use that rifle, yet I own a farming property where it might be of some use from time to time.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I support the banning of guns that are designed purely for military purposes. One of the reasons comes back to my practical views. Having won the rifle shooting in the national service with the old .303, I always found the modern weapon particularly inaccurate for the purposes for which it would be used in sport or feral animal control. The reality is that they all have a barrel about so long, and they have this massive fire power to make up for their accuracy. They are not appropriate for anything other than killing other people at close range. I am astounded that over the years federal governments of various persuasions have even allowed their importation. Why state governments considered they should be sold is beyond my understanding.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Rifles usually have a significantly longer barrel than some of the multi&amp;hyphen;fire so-called sporting weapons—to give them the sort of accuracy needed when shooting feral or other animals at a distance. Such weapons are consequently very difficult to conceal. In the Port Arthur situation, for instance, the alleged killer was able to put his weapon in a sports bag. These are the circumstances of these sorts of weapons. There is a difference.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        People should always have a need before the weapons are licensed. The Western Australian requirements that have existed as long as I can remember, which relate to the registration of both the gun and the person, are entirely appropriate and should be the national standard.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe that this huge amount of money that we are getting ready to distribute under this legislation today is somehow aimed at gun control rather than gun legislation. I often remind people that gun control is 10 per cent legislation and 90 per cent administration. I should probably break administration into 45
        <break page="3333" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         per cent administration—that is, the activities of the police and others—and 45 per cent compliance. We need community support, but not from the general public, who do not own guns. Whilst they have opinions and support this process, they are not relevant to the debate when it comes to gun control. In the current environment of unregistered gun ownership within some states in Australia, we are almost totally reliant on community support from gun owners and their willingness to comply with the law. I feel that the emotion of this debate has created a situation where that compliance will not be forthcoming.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have legislators who were involved at the federal level and those who have actually legislated in the states, particularly those states where, unlike Western Australia, the police do not know whose door to knock on, although they know they have a large range of gun owners out there. All that those gun owners have to do is produce a single gun and say, `Yes, this is the gun for which I am licensed.' The fact that they might have a large number of other weapons somewhere else is not known to the police, to whom the legislation gives the right to search without warrant. I think this might be very interesting to other people who break the law in certain categories, large and small: they might be getting worried about this. Clearly, if the police now have a suspicion about other matters, it is pretty simple to think they have a suspicion about gun ownership or the retention of guns on a property. They would enter it for that purpose and might walk out with three little marijuana plants that were growing in the bathroom. The people who worry about those sorts of things can deal with it themselves.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reality is that unless there is a high level of willingness to comply with these new laws, the only other solution basically is the sledgehammer on the yale lock. How many Australians would think that that was appropriate in the circumstances? As I understand it, that is how the laws are being written in this new proposal.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The unwillingness of legislators to moderate their legislation in terms of the banning of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         certain guns has greatly undermined community support from gun owners and, consequently, reduced the potential for a high level of compliance. In particular, I wish to refer to the licensing of modified multi-shot weapons such as semiautomatic and pump action shotguns by the process of crimping, a word which is now part of our terminology.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is nothing about a gun that cannot be modified and remodified with reasonable equipment. As I reminded the Liberal party room, give me an old copy of
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Jane's
        </emphasis>
        magazine and a reasonable machine workshop and I will make you an Owen gun over a weekend. The Owen gun was rejected by military forces after its invention because it was so simple. My recollection is that it had three or four moving parts. All that is required for an automatic weapon is a piston and a spring. The firing pin is in the piston, the firing of the first shot returns the piston against the spring and the spring then returns the piston against the next shot. Away it goes until it empties the magazine, which is a rather simple spring&amp;hyphen;loaded box.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The argument that a crimping process could not be tolerated on the grounds that it is reversible is a fallacious argument. Anything is reversible. The fact is that you can make a gun from scratch that would do all the damage that occurred at Port Arthur. That is not the issue. The issue for me came from my assessment within my own electorate and other parts of the country. Why would somebody who owns a gun that is presently not registered as a firearm, which is not on any government register or any piece of paper, go through the process—in this case it is a five&amp;hyphen;shot magazine—of going to an armourer and paying them the money to have the weapon modified to have a magazine capacity of two shots? That is the equivalent of a double&amp;hyphen;barrelled shotgun which, we are assured, is licensable—though not yet by nine&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old or 14&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old potential olympians: that is another issue that I want to come back to. That double&amp;hyphen;barrelled shotgun is licensable under fairly reasonable conditions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have a situation where somebody would go to an armourer, have a single&amp;hyphen;barrel, semiautomatic shotgun modified down to a
        <break page="3334" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         two-shot capacity, take it along to the police, have it registered, let the world know they are the owner and then go back to the armourer. I doubt that they would get the armourer to remodify it, unless he was a crook, because that person is licensed and would be unlikely to want to participate in such an unlawful act or go through some process of reconverting that weapon to a five&amp;hyphen;shot magazine capacity and returning it to an illegal status. Why would you do that when all you had to do was keep the gun at home in the first place and ignore the whole process?
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        You have to look at these things on the balance of probability. Persons who went through that process would have done it for the purpose of making the gun and themselves legal. The problem we now have is that all those people have only one solution: confiscation or voluntary handover. They cannot retain the ownership of that style of weapon, even if it is limited to two&amp;hyphen;shot capacity.

        There are reasons why people want these sorts of weapons, particularly women involved in the sport of clay target shooting which got a bit of prominence the other day because it was the first gold medal that Australia won when we were pretty well down in the dumps after we had not been as successful as we anticipated in the swimming pool.

I have had people say to me, `So what is the difference? What is the difference between Michael Diamond's over&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;under double&amp;hyphen;barrel shotgun and a semiautomatic? They both fire a cartridge. Surely the impact on the shoulder is the same?' Of course, it is not. It is substantially different. With any automatic weapon, between your shoulder and the point of explosion there is a big spring which is used for the reloading mechanism. That is what cushions the effect on a person's shoulder.

         Although Michael Diamond did not explain this to us on his numerous televisions appearances, I would not be surprised if that gun that he is using cost about $10,000. Any over&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;under shotgun is relatively expensive compared with a five&amp;hyphen;shot Browning. Let's face it: not everybody who starts clay target shooting decides that they are going to be an Olympian overnight. It is pretty clear from the success rate of our people at the Olympics that you need to start at about eight or nine years of age to achieve that.

         The legislation that was recently passed in New South Wales and Victoria as yet makes no provision for anybody to be participating in that sport, or particularly national and state championships, at age nine and 14. I am wondering when the legislators will get round to it. Apparently they are talking about it. We are running around the countryside now trying to find 14&amp;hyphen; and 15&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old kids to compete as our representatives at the Sydney Olympics, but not with guns. That is a rather silly aspect of the emotional approach that is being taken, rather than a practical approach to achieve the maximum amount of compliance and a commonsense approach to multi&amp;hyphen;shot weapons and some of these other issues.

         I have asked my colleagues in Western Australia whether there is anything in this new legislation that substantially increases the penalties for breaking and entering to steal a gun or simply stealing one.

         I also draw to the attention of the House my other area of concern. Nobody likes death by any means, and guns—primarily through the act of suicide—kill over 500 people a year. I think some 400&amp;hyphen;odd such deaths are suicides. Suicide becomes the act through a gun because of its availability. We certainly do not propose to take every gun out of society.

          I think any assessment of the suicides would probably show that the guns used in those very unfortunate events would be guns that would remain licensed. The reality is that they are a very simple and available means of taking your own life and they will feature highly in the statistics.

          The point I want to make—and it is directly relevant to this legislation—is that we have decided to raise $500 million through the Medicare levy for the purpose of buying back some of these guns. I am very concerned, for instance, about certain guns which are now licensed and in people's hands. These people, though, are no longer going to be eligible to be licensed as they do not have an appropriate need. There is nothing in this legislation or the arrangements for compensation to compensate those people—only people who are handing in a gun that is no longer licensable. I draw the House's attention to the fact that that is another reason why certain people will not hand in their guns. That is not what we are about. We want to get these guns out of circulation if people do not have an appropriate need.

When is this parliament going to decide that it can do something for those people who die day after day but who get no recognition in this place by way of appropri ate research funding? We should apply an appropriate practical and pragmatic formula for the Australians who die in their tens of thousands each year of heart failure and cancer.

          If this House is prepared to raise $500 million to prevent some proportion of 500 people dying, what should it be doing, if its motives are genuine and not just prompted by these sorts of flushes on issues? Why aren't we deciding to work hard and have some decent funding? Maybe you should keep the Medicare levy alive for research into heart disease and cancer. I think the place would be a lot more credible if we did, because this fund raising and expenditure that we are debating now is a knee&amp;hyphen;jerk reaction to an aspect of life and death in Australia which, by any comparison, results in very small numbers of deaths. I am not saying we should not approach it, but I would rather the $500 million had gone into those areas where death results from the health problems which are the real mass killers and which, as I say, kill many more people every day of the year than died at Port Arthur.

        It has been based right from the start on a false premise. We were told by the Prime Minister and by every advocate for this legislation that we cannot afford to go down the American road, that that would be a disaster.

        Gun related violence is dropping in Australia. It has dropped since statistics were first kept in 1915. As the member for O'Connor said, suicide accounts for by far the greatest number of deaths—in fact, 400 males and 20 females. If you want to do something about the number of suicides—and I certainly think we should—you do not tackle it effectively by way of a gun law, because you only need one bullet for suicide. You should tackle it through its cause, which is overwhelmingly the economic system. Economic pressure is what drove a lot of those people to suicide, particularly in rural areas. Break&amp;hyphen;up of families also contributes significantly to both suicide and murder. There is absolutely no doubt about that. The Family Law Court is out of control. Nobody is prepared to tackle it. The child support system is also visibly unfair. They have been the biggest drivers of suicide, which is not going to be affected by this bill.

        Even if you do ban all guns, every single gun, you will not reduce the suicide rate. There are other countries that have far higher suicide rates and they do not use guns. One phenomenon which seems to be emerging in Australia is suicide by way of the head&amp;hyphen;on crash. Ambulance people have told me that in their view these crashes are very often simply suicide, which puts enormous trauma on the other party, I think quite unfairly. I would rather that people made their own individual arrangements if they are going to commit suicide.

        Also, we must look at the cost involved—$500 million, as the member for O'Connor

         said. If you want to use this money to save lives, how many more lives would be saved if you spent it on dangerous parts of our highways, on road engineering? What about diabetes research? Diabetes, with all its attendant complications, is probably the biggest cause of death in this nation. I believe that with suitable investment we could get vast improvements, certainly for the quality of life of people. But, of course, that would be too logical to be entertained by a Prime Minister who was simply grandstanding on a tragedy that occurred in Australia—a tragedy on which his actions will have no effect at all; he knows that—and a tragedy that will occur again because its occurrence is driven by factors other than the availability of guns.

        I agree with the member for O'Connor that there is no need for military style self-loading rifles or automatic weapons. It should be noted here that, while members supporting this legislation confidently talk about automatic weapons, automatic weapons have been illegal in this country since 1928. That does not mean that you cannot get them; of course you can get them. They are available on the black market now and they will be available after this legislation is passed.

        The government always had the power to ban the import of these weapons and it did not do so. That is the hypocrisy of governments.

        In my lifetime, on three occasions I have had to rely on professional shooting for a living. In the 1950s I was shooting both rabbits and kangaroos. In 1970, with the pastoral downturn, I existed largely by shooting kangaroos. I had a high powered 243 rifle with a mag&amp;hyphen;power scope. I know that with that bolt action rifle I could do far more damage than anyone could ever do with a self-loading 22. It is not unreasonable that with a gun like that you would be able to group the five shots in the magazine in a cigarette packet at 200 yards, something you simply cannot do with a 22. The truth is that

That man has an emotional attachment to that gun. If he is caught with it after legislation goes through, he is looking at draconian penalties.

        The police ministers looked at crimping some years ago, in 1987 I think it was, and decided it was not worth the effort. But there is no doubt that crimping would have limited the shotguns to two cartridges—exactly as the member for O'Connor said. The fact that the Prime Minister refused to accept that in the face of the advice from all the police ministers from every state was an act of sheer panic. He was frightened that he would be seen as weak and ineffectual if he accepted this very logical amendment. That is a very unfortunate and sad way to be making laws in this country. The member for O'Connor was right. The banning of self-loading shotguns in the sporting area will impact disproportionately on women and young people because they are the people who use them most.

But now we are arming every single policeman in the state with the same power. If anyone thinks this will not be used for intimidation or fishing expeditions by the police force, then they are living in cuckoo land. It will be used that way. It will be used to harass people.

        Another problem is that the legislation puts all aspects after the bill is passed into the regulations and gives the power to the police commissioner, who could wake up tomorrow and for no reason other than sheer caprice say, `I have decided to ban single shots' or even slingshots, and there is no appeal against it. This denies the parliament the right to discuss this matter. It denies the public the right to be able to lobby their politicians on it. It is another example of what has happened so much in this country, where politicians have abdicated their responsibilities and passed their rights, powers and influence over to individuals. It is very worrying. It is about time we in parliament stopped doing that.

        I was at Halls Creek the other day where, as members would have seen in the newspapers, there was a riot involving about 200 Aboriginal people. It is not a new occurrence. It simply got out of control. The same sort of
        <break page="3338" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         thing has happened on previous occasions and the police have been able to control it, so it did not get the big publicity. On this occasion they lost control and substantial damage was done, probably significantly less than the media reported. I suspect that the cost of the damage was probably less than $300,000—not the reported $1 million—and that it was fairly limited: the police station, a roadhouse and minimal damage in other areas.

        I must say in passing that, while that behaviour of those Aboriginal people—they were not Aboriginals from Halls Creek; they were from the desert communities—was inexcusable, there were reasons for it. The reasons are longstanding, have been festering for a long time and have never been addressed. In fact, it goes back to the time when Gerry Hand was the minister. Gerry Hand spent over $4 million in the Balgo area. Contrary to the wishes of the people, the money was wasted. Had it been put into Balgo, this incident might not have happened. Quite frankly, young people in Balgo live today in mind-numbing boredom, and so a visit to Halls Creek for a rodeo is a big event.

        What happened on that occasion? They came in with money. When the money was gone, they were at the point of going back when a whole lot of money was distributed to them in Halls Creek instead of back on the station. What happened in Halls Creek pales into insignificance, in my view, when measured against the behaviour of people in the assault on Parliament House the other day. For them, there was no excuse. It was an un&amp;hyphen;Australian act of gross vandalism. The union movement was extremely naive not to realise that there were certain elements there that were looking for that sort of publicity. Of course, they have done to the whole union movement a lot of damage, and that is very unfortunate.

To me, the significance of that has nothing to do with getting votes—not in the nauseating sense that was suggested earlier in this debate.

        That cultural change has to start somewhere. It could have started 10 years ago. It could have started last year, when the previous government was seeking to get the states to agree to some changes. It would have been wonderful if the leadership of the Liberal Party and National Party in those days had seen the wisdom of acting sooner. Perhaps Port Arthur could have been averted if there had been that political courage in those days. But the fact now is that the current opposition has done what should have been done by oppositions in New South Wales and in the Commonwealth over many years—it is accepting and supporting.

        In saying that, it is important to keep in mind though that this really is a small part of the change—in effect, the easy part. Automatics and semiautomatics account for some six per cent of deaths by guns. The vast bulk of the deaths are from single&amp;hyphen;shot .22s and single&amp;hyphen; or double&amp;hyphen;barrel shotguns. They account for something like 70 per cent. They are not affected in this legislation, in a way, because they are not being recovered. But, of course, they do affect an awful lot of households and an awful lot of people.

        What will be of concern to the community at large, and certainly should be of concern to all parliamentarians, is that while, on the one hand, the government and the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) said in the second reading speech, `This government has agreed to provide assistance to the states on such a scale to demonstrate national leadership in dealing with the problem of gun control'—and we all say, `Hear, hear,' and all support that—what we are seeing is a one-off measure to recover weapons which account for only six per cent of the problem.

        This comes the day after the budget has massively cut support to the states. It will cost a lot more than this to monitor, maintain and service the gun register and the community. Establishing a gun register and recovering guns is important, but this must be monitored in households where there is domestic violence and manic depression. Licences expire—and then what will happen? Are the guns still there? All the issues that we know are part of the problem are not covered by this levy. What is happening here should be a natural and normal part of government expenditure.

        In fact we have done the opposite. Most states will be forced to cut their police budgets as a result of last night's budget. Most states will be forced to cut the money available to the police forces to monitor gun control. That is not keeping faith with the Australian people, nor is it keeping faith with the spirit of this legislation or the speeches that have been made for so many months. The community has a reasonable expectation now that, because there is unanimity on both sides of the parliament, this issue will keep going. Last night they would have expected some provision in the budget for an ongoing commitment to help the states shift resources into this area. The fact is that it is not there, and that is disappointing.

        One has to question and wonder whether or not the commitment from the government extends only to making a levy available. This is a one&amp;hyphen;off levy for one purpose. Funds need to be made available in every budget every year to the states to maintain that register, to check the register of gun owners and the sorts of households where guns are kept, and to check households where there are domestic violence or apprehended violence orders, manic depression and other kinds of problems. In New South Wales alone in the last year there were almost 4,000 breaches of AVOs and DVOs that we know of. We do not know how many households do not have them, and domestic violence is a major problem.

Year after year we have received letter after letter and we have stood firm in our support for these kinds of measures. That support should continue, but most of us would like to take it to the next stage. We want to be part of the next part of the solution, which is helping to support the states. The states have had their budgets cut. State police budgets are under enormous stress and now the states will be forced to choose whether they take police off the beat and put them on gun registers. That is an unfair choice for them to make, because it is a national issue. The national government should be putting funds towards these measures in a particular and specific way—not by a levy but as part of a normal national budgetary issue.

The legislation before this parliament implements the Commonwealth's part in that deal. Most of the changes to firearm legislation, quite necessarily, are changes to state law and one by one the state jurisdictions are carrying out their end of the bargain.

         The National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1996 appropriates money for financial assistance to the states, to the Australian Capital Territory and to the Northern Territory in connection with the implementation of the national firearms program. The appropriation is for the purpose of payments to the states and territories so that they may be reimbursed for compensation payments made by them to persons who hand in self-loading rifles, self-loading shotguns and pump action shotguns as part of the nationwide amnesty and compensation for surrender scheme agreed by the Australasian Police Ministers Council on 10 May 1996.

While most of the payments are likely to be made in 1996-97, it is anticipated that some may not be made until the following financial year.

Every one of those people believes it is not only their right to be able to protect their wife, their kids and their home in the wider sense of the word, but also their moral obligation. They have been brought up to believe it is their duty to protect their brothers, their sisters, their children and their parents.

I don't know whether the report was exaggerated, but I do know that one of the mass circulation dailies in Queensland used to run a column each week which would just state the home invasions for the week. That is how common they are. My own family and my wife's family in Brisbane can clock up something like 21 home invasions amongst some 10 or 15 houses.

I would say, `Do you think it is a reasonable proposition that you are not allowed to protect your wife and kids with a firearm if you have got someone in there threatening them?' In my state the Premier, the Deputy Premier and the Minister for Police said before the last election that they would have no hesitation in shooting someone who came in and threatened their wives and children. That is on the media record of the state of Queensland. If I am a lunatic, I think you would have to include the Premier, the Deputy Premier and the Minister for Police in that state.

         It is illegal for you to use a firearm to protect your wife and kids. That is resolution 3A. It is a most remarkable statement. I said to the interviewers, `Do you accept that proposition?' Even the most hostile of those interviewers, when confronted with 3A, said, `No, that really is going far too far.' I said, `All right. Is the proposition being put forward by people like myself unreasonable?' They said, `With respect to 3A it most certainly is not.' I can go back and reel off all the people that were interviewed, but I suppose almost every principal interviewer in Australia would have been included in that group of people. Every single one of those people accepted the proposition that 3A was totally unreasonable and unacceptable to the vast bulk of people—and to almost every single Australian, I would venture to submit.

         Having been a legislator for 22 years, I have learnt by bitter experience that you do not just take a facile superficial view of something. You look at it and you say, `What will happen if we do this?' Let us look at what will happen if we do this—and we are doing it. The reason we are doing it is to stop Port Arthurs and Hoddle Streets. Will it stop a Port Arthur or a Hoddle Street? Both those people were flagrantly in violation of the gun laws of both those states, so clearly this legislation will have absolutely no effect on stopping a Hoddle Street or a Port Arthur from occurring in the future.

         To those of you who think that it is difficult to secure a gun—I have refrained from saying how easy it is to secure a gun and I am not going to repeat it or say it anywhere but I will speak to anyone who wants to speak privately to me—let me say that the proposition that, by removing guns and making guns illegal, people are not going to be able to access guns and the sort of person who carried out this terrible crime at Port Arthur is not going to be able to access guns is really quite stupid and infantile. It is a matter of a telephone call and sending some money. That is about as difficult as it is. For those of you who do not know much about guns, of course a decent machine shop in a day, or most certainly two days, could machine up an Owen gun. Three moving metal parts is all that an Owen gun

         I do not doubt for a moment the sincerity of the Prime Minister in this. I have on many occasions attacked—and attacked without hesitation—but I do not doubt the Prime Minister's sincerity in this. But I do criticise the fact that, within four days, we were able to find a solution to the Hoddle Streets and the Port Arthurs. That was really amazing to me. The British parliament is still out. The Dunblane commission of inquiry is still out nine months afterwards. We were able to do in four days what has taken the British government some nine months—I think that is the figure—of deliberations in Great Britain. Even allowing for the lack of capacity by the English, I think that really is going a little far.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The other interesting thing about Dunblane is that Dunblane occurred after the banning of firearms in Great Britain. It occurred afterwards, not before. The British government thought this was a solution that would stop this, and what happens is that afterwards they have the most horrific occurrence in all of recent British history. So they have to ask themselves the question: did we take a wrong turn? We did not question that. We know what we are doing. We are very clever. This is going to solve these problems and eliminate them.

Nobody followed it up, so I assume that they confronted them and nobody knew what the Tarasoff rule was.

The Tarasoff rule is the only legal way in which a psychiatrist is able to divulge information that he has received as part of the patient-doctor relationship. That needs to be reversed. Where a dangerous situation exists and the psychiatrist knows that a dangerous situation exists, the onus should be upon him to divulge that information.

         In Switzerland—which is right next door to East Germany, for those people who are not familiar with their geography, and most of the Swiss actually speak German—every single house has an automatic military rifle. Do you know that this country, where every single house has a rifle, has, arguably, the lowest homicide rate with guns in the world? If you want to turn to the United States, exactly the same figures come up. New York, Washington DC and Chicago, where guns are virtually banned, have the highest unlawful homicide rates with guns in the world. In the southern states, which have very liberal attitudes towards guns, the homicide rate with guns is a third and a quarter of what it is in those other states.

         We have to look no further than Australia. The year before we introduced restrictive legislation in Queensland, we had eight homicides with guns. In the same year, Victoria, with the most draconian and restrictive legislation in Australia, had 58 homicides with guns. But let me be fair and go to averages in the years leading up to that. Thirty-two homicides is the average for New South Wales; 36 homicides is the average for Victoria; and only 13 homicides is the average for Queensland. In other words, New South Wales had a 40 per cent higher rate than the liberal laws of Queensland and Victoria had a 100 per cent higher rate.

        In the second reading speech that I delivered yesterday I indicated that the National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1996 provides for the Commonwealth to provide funds to the states and territories for compensation for surrendered guns and for the implementation of the states' surrender and buy-back schemes. It will also enable funds to be provided for the national education campaign in relation to the firearms scheme.

        The members for O'Connor, Kalgoorlie and Kennedy made a number of comments critical of the agreement reached by the Australasian Police Ministers Council on 10 May and 17 July—agreements under which all states and territories agreed on the need for and the form of uniform firearms laws. I do not propose to reply in detail to what those members said. What they had to say by way of criticism I suggest is not really directly relevant to a bill which is designed to enable  appropriation of funds for the implementation of that scheme.

        The majority of gun owners and the overwhelming majority of the community at large have demonstrated their support for what has been agreed by the police ministers. The government is serious about ensuring that gun owners are made aware of their rights under the proposed new laws and that they receive compensation moneys for firearms to be surrendered as soon as is practicable. If the members for O'Connor, Kalgoorlie and Kennedy have the genuine concerns of firearms owners at heart—and I believe they do

        The member for Banks spoke for the opposition and gave wholehearted support to the bill. The government is very grateful for that. The shadow minister indicated that the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Bolkus, has some reservations which are proposed to be raised. All I can say is that I do not know what those reservations are. It would have been a little more helpful if they had been raised in this House where I can respond to them rather than in the Senate where I am unable to.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for O'Connor raised the issue of compensation not being available to people who have to hand in non-prohibited guns, they being in a situation where they will not have a genuine reason for possessing or owning a gun at all. He suggested that this will be a disincentive for these people to hand in their guns. The scheme does not necessarily contemplate that they will hand in their guns. It should be understood that a person presently owning a firearm which they will not be entitled to retain under the proposed new laws will be free to sell the gun. It is reasonable to assume that there may be a greater market for category A and category B firearms—that is, those subject to fewer restrictions—on the basis that those who currently hold category C or category D firearms may wish to acquire another firearm in place of the surrendered firearm. That may result in a greater market, as I suggested. We have yet to see what that impact will be.

        The member for Newcastle suggested that the bill should provide for an ongoing contribution by the Commonwealth in the budget for the maintenance of a system of monitoring. That really is a responsibility of the states and territories. It is the states and territories who will introduce the uniform laws which will set up the prohibited, restricted and allowed  categories and the circumstances under which the permitted categories can be held. It will be the states who are responsible for collecting the surrendered firearms and for paying compensation.

         The system of uniform licensing of firearms and registration of gun owners will enable the states and territories to engage in monitoring. There will also be the capacity for interstate monitoring through the linking of each of the state and territory systems through the National Exchange of Police Information, NEPI, enabling, for example, a police officer in one state to know exactly what the situation is in another. Under this bill, the Commonwealth will make significant contributions to the establishment of the state and territory systems.

         The member for Kennedy raised the question of use of firearms for personal protection. As I said, this is not directly relevant to the debate. I remind the member for Kennedy that all jurisdictions agreed that personal protection is not to be accepted as a genuine reason for owning a long-arm firearm. No jurisdiction will accordingly in its legislation provide that as a reason. He suggested that there will be difficulties with compliance. This is a common criticism offered by those who are basically opposed to what is being done. The government's view is that the overwhelming majority of firearms owners are law&amp;hyphen;abiding citizens. They will be aware that the overwhelming majority of the community support the uniform system of registration and licensing. They will be aware that the overwhelming majority of the community, including gun owners, support the uniform system of firearms laws that is being put in place.

        I wish to speak briefly to the first initiative relating to defence housing assistance today. The secret to addressing personnel difficulties being experienced in the defence forces is to make the lives of our Defence Force personnel as normal as possible. I was just 10 years of age when former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam brought the last of our troops home from Vietnam. Those of my age and younger have very little memory of that conflict or any conflict before it. Last year's Australia Remembers activities and last weekend's ceremonies to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan are poignant and appropriate reminders, particularly to younger Australians, of the sacrifices made by our former service men and women and how important it is to us as a nation that we retain a strong defence force.

        During the election campaign, the coalition made a commitment to serving defence families across Australia. I was very pleased to make this commitment to defence families at Puckapunyal to extend and increase the benefits available to defence personnel under the defence home owner scheme. This bill delivers on those promises.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Before commenting on these amendments, I would like to mention the importance to Australians of the ideal of owning a home. The family home has traditionally been an icon of security and stability in Australian society. It is usually the most valuable asset that a family possesses. It is, for many, the most important investment of their life. The sense of success, prosperity and security is encapsulated in the notion that the great Australian dream is to own your own home. Many Australians are comforted by the knowledge that their retirement will be secured by home ownership. This dream is just as relevant today as it has been to past generations. The family home is security, an investment and it provides peace of mind.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Defence families are no different from any other Australian families in wanting to achieve this security. Historically, though, this ideal has been difficult for defence families to realise. Having been a regular visitor to Puckapunyal over the years, I know how difficult it has been for defence personnel to establish a permanent family home. The nature of the job, with its recurrent postings and removals, temporary accommodation and the difficulty of finding suitable housing often cause enormous hardship, especially for younger couples.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under these circumstances, establishing the security of the family home has been difficult. Sometimes this has meant that our most promising personnel search for jobs that they feel will give them a more secure future and a better chance of settling down. Sadly, many of those jobs have been outside the Defence Force.

        The defence home loans scheme recognises the challenges faced by defence personnel and

         their families. If they are to have the same opportunities as other Australians, then we must provide them with those benefits. One way of accomplishing this is the improvement of the scheme of home ownership.

        To make sure we have the best possible defence force, we must make sure we retain the best personnel. To encourage our young men and women to stay longer, the government will recognise the value that our defence forces provide to the nation by giving them a tangible reward for the service that they give. These hardworking people who defend the country and give our nation a sense of security deserve some of that security for themselves. This bill provides the changes which will deliver that reward and significantly improve the conditions of service for members of the Australian defence forces.

        Contained in this bill is a doubling of the maximum amount available for a subsidised loan under the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act to $80,000, or $160,000 where spouses have a joint entitlement.

The bill also introduces a reduction in the basic eligibility period that applies for new borrowers from six years continuous full&amp;hyphen;time service to five years.

       <para first-indent="16">
        By increasing the feasibility and attractiveness of home ownership for Australian Defence Force members, these changes will provide a cost&amp;hyphen;effective alternative to rental assistance. The scheme will also be extended to reservists who have completed a basic eligibility period of eight years of statutory training obligation. This bill will be warmly welcomed by my local constituency in Puckapunyal and by defence personnel Australia&amp;hyphen;wide, because it will substantially improve the availability of long&amp;hyphen;term, secure housing for members of our defence forces.

         —I am well qualified to be speaking on these proposed amendments to defence legislation as I was a RAAF officer before my election to this place on 2 March this year. The honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) has outlined the detail of the proposed amendments to the defence home loans scheme. However, one thing she did not mention was the terribly deleterious effect on morale that occurred in the last six years of the Labor government that has led to measures such as this one being necessary to raise the morale of our defence forces and increase retention rates.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of my main reasons for joining the Liberal Party in 1994 was to make our political leaders aware of what was happening in defence. Each Paul Keating budget took more from defence to give to special interest groups. The loyal and motivated personnel of our Defence Force were continually being asked to do more with less. In our patriotic service industry there is no union, and no allowance for overtime and double time or teabreaks put into any awards. Our defence personnel are becoming more and more cynical and dispirited with each passing year. I know. I was in the military for the last six years. Morale had taken a significant downturn. The Dibb review had set defence spending at 2.4 per cent of GDP to maintain a credible, self-reliant defence force. This was endorsed in subsequent white papers, in the strategic 1993 review and in the 1994 white paper.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Yet we find defence spending currently at 1.9 per cent of GDP. The navy at present has 14,400 uniformed personnel, down from over 17,000. The army has 25,964 personnel, down from over 40,000. The air force is currently at 17,221, down from over 22,000. As can be seen in the Australian Defence Force, this has significantly reduced its uniformed branch in the last four or five years and has had a
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         corresponding effect on morale. Believe me, when I stood for parliament morale in the defence forces was at the lowest I had ever felt it in six years. Therefore, something needs to be done to raise the morale and recognise the value of the sacrifice of our serving personnel.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The recognition in last night's budget that Australia's Defence Force had been cut to the bone and could not take any further cuts, despite a number of sacrifices that have been made across departments, went some way to restoring morale. These changes to the defence home loans scheme go further down the track of restoring Australia's Defence Force to a credible force in our region of strategic interest.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        People join the Defence Force for various reasons—to serve their country, proud to be part of an effective uniformed branch. It is the morale, the feeling of camaraderie, the indefinable essence of being part of a team that is the effective weapon in war. The way personnel feel about their squad, platoon, company or battalion and how they consider their country to be relying on them to perform when it counts will enable outnumbered, unequipped, fatigued personnel to overcome outstanding odds, as happened in Long Tan, Milne Bay, northern Africa and Gallipoli. If there is low morale in our personnel—and 40 per cent of our defence budget is spent on personnel—that has a terribly deleterious effect on our effectiveness and our fighting capacity as a military force.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The enhancement of the defence loans scheme provides incentive for military personnel to remain in the military. Their initial training is costly. If we cannot retain personnel we will not get the best defence force for the money available, which is the situation we are in at the moment. As at June this year, 13 per cent of the navy's personnel are leaving each year, 12 per cent of the army's and nine per cent of the air force's. With separation rates like that, these valued personnel resources are being wasted. When you consider that 40 per cent of the defence budget is spent on personnel, you begin to realise why morale is so important. During times of high morale, separation rates are lower.

         I have served in the military for over six years in my capacity as a defence lawyer. I have had cause to use the Defence Force Discipline Act, which is also proposed to be amended under this bill. Discipline is something unique to the military. It is also used to enhance morale. It is meted out equally by COs who are responsible for their troops' welfare, wellbeing and equipment and also criminal and non-military behaviour. The Defence Force Discipline Act is used to enforce a high standard of discipline, which is just not possible in a civilian workplace. The act provides for detention, fines and other judicial sentencing options for breaches of discipline in the military. It is a unique act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In today's society, the standards of morality and the codes of conduct required of our Defence Force are substantially higher than is perhaps appropriate. Where in the civilian arena you would probably be fined $100 for using marijuana, in the Defence Force it will cost you your job. The Defence Force requires a high standard of discipline from its troops and personnel. We do not look lightly on breaches of the law. The successive implementation of the Defence Force Discipline Act and its smooth implementation and enactment are important to maintaining discipline.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The changes proposed to the Defence Act basically relate to section 62, which allows for the Crimes Act of New South Wales to be substituted with the Crimes Act of the Australian Capital Territory. This became necessary with the move from the Australian Capital Territory into statehood.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Defence Force Discipline Act provides for a number of offences, both military and civil. Military offences would be things like absent without leave, not having a proper haircut or not shining your shoes or the classic section 60 offence which is the old section of conduct unbecoming a military officer. Section 61 allows for the prosecution of substantial criminal acts. This is important for personnel serving overseas so that it can be seen that the Australian military will try its own people under its own law for any actions taken overseas.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is important because when I worked as a lawyer at the RAAF base in Malaysia the Malaysians would frequently give us jurisdiction if it could be seen that we were dealing with our own people. It is important that that ambiguity over that section is clarified so that we retain jurisdiction and the right to request jurisdiction from foreign powers under our own defence, our own code of conduct, in the military.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This bill goes some way, and this government will go even further, to regain the morale of our defence forces and that indefinable spirit within the military that adds to our fighting capacity. With foresight and vision into and throughout the next century, our defence forces will become more focused on the modern challenges facing them in technology and the demands from the personal management side of defence as well. I commend the bill to the House.

They are designed to give effect to the undertakings made by the government, prior to the election, that the increases in loan assistance for defence personnel would be available from 1 July. The Liberal Party's policy in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the last election was unequivocal on this point. I should record again for the purposes of the debate on this amendment the exact words that the Liberal Party put to the Australian people:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The coalition will increase the maximum loan value under the ADF home loan assistance scheme from $40,000 to $80,000 and the eligibility period will be reduced to five years. This will come into effect by 1 July 1996, not 1 January 1997 as proposed by Labor.
       </para>
       <para>
        The policy, the election commitments, the statements and the propaganda of the Liberal Party were absolutely clear beyond any confusion. They said not that the bills would be introduced, not that some time later in this calendar year people will be able to get access to those higher rates of benefit, but that they would come into effect by 1 July.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Indeed, you could argue that the bill should operate from before 1 July, but the words said that they would be in effect by 1 July. Here we are in August and the bill that the government has presented does nothing of the sort. The bill the government presents would have a date of operation somewhere in the future when it is given royal assent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Yesterday during the debate, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) interjected that she had complied with this undertaking by introducing the bill into the parliament before 1 July. That was clearly not what the Liberal Party said before the election. It was clearly not what they told the service community of Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is quite humorous to think that the minister could stand in this place and justify honouring the undertaking by introducing the bill on 26 June—the second last day of sittings before we rose—five days before that 1 July deadline and then have the debate on the second reading start on 20 August, seven weeks after the supposed start date of 1 July.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Presumably it will not go to the Senate this week, which means that the very first opportunity for it to go to the Senate will be when we come back in the next couple of weeks on Monday, 9 September—10 weeks after 1 July. Ten weeks after the day on which it is supposed to come into effect, the Senate may, at its earliest opportunity, get to consider it.

        We would realistically be looking at a delay of some three or four months, the absolute minimum, before this bill would be given royal assent. In fact, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that the bill would not get royal assent much before 1 January 1997 anyway. The Liberal Party's platform gave a clear commitment. Not content to have given a clear commitment that it would come into effect by, not on—that is, before or no later than—1 July, you then sought to make some political capital out of that by adding: `not 1 January 1997, as promised by Labor'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        You were very clear in your intentions before the election that you would have this up and running by 1 July. You sought to make political gain out of that by saying that you would do it before the Labor government of the day had planned to do it. That is fine. I am quite happy to support that. Indeed, I now give you the opportunity to support the amendments and ensure that those people who have applied for this loan since 1 July get access to the higher rates that the bill would provide. This will test your integrity and willingness to honour your pre-election commitments and give you an opportunity to set the record straight.

I also heard from both sides of the House that it was required there be an increase in the size of the mortgage that was available because this basically represents an important recruitment tool.

         It is interesting that when the former Labor government introduced the original scheme, the $40,000 scheme, only 1,750&amp;hyphen;odd people ever took it up. So it clearly was not working. We gave an undertaking in our policy document prior to the election that we would increase that from $40,000 to $80,000, but we went further. I heard the plaintive cries of the opposition trying to say that it was their policy. It was not. Yes, the sum of $80,000 was common to both policies but we said that we would reduce the eligibility period from six years to five years and that we would also extend it to reservists. Those two initiatives were entirely separate from anything the Labor Party ever proposed and made the whole proposition quite different.

         We said, with very good and honest intention, that we would introduce the legislation and have it operating from 1 July. The fact of the matter is that when I became the minister I began work on the bill immediately. It was prepared and then it took its place in the queue to go before the cabinet. I introduced the bill at the earliest possible time, that being 26 June, and made my second reading speech on that occasion, which is, again, a change from the way in which the previous government used to do business when they would introduce legislation without any second reading speech.

         The original amendment the opposition moved yesterday, as I pointed out to them, cannot have any practical effect. The amendment will mislead and confuse people should it be pursued.

         The shadow minister for defence, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), contacted my office some weeks ago and we facilitated a briefing for the shadow minister with the department on this precise issue. Does he really think that there would be some reason why I would not put 1 July 1996 in the bill if it had been so simple? Does he really think that it was something that was not considered?

         The issue the opposition has raised is whether the amendments to the act made by the bill can be made to operate retrospectively to 1 July. As the bill is currently drafted, the amendments will come into operation with royal assent.

        I will read to you from the minute so that you can understand it step by step. As I have explained to you, it applies only to eligible persons. Secondly, after completing the qualifying period, the eligible member will accrue one year of loan interest subsidy entitlement for each completed year of effective full&amp;hyphen;time service. That is why, when the application is made, you have to have served a half year in order to get a little waiver of
        <break page="3359" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the full year because the services take it on trust that after serving six months after your five years—to which we are bringing the period down—you will stick around for the remaining six months so that you will have the full&amp;hyphen;year entitlement. We do it that way to expedite it. The maximum amount of the loan is $80,000.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us go through the procedural requirements. In order to obtain the subsidy payable, you have to go through an administrative procedure. The member applies for an entitlement certificate under section 10 of the act. An entitlement certificate is not issued unless the member meets the criteria set out in section 12 of the act—that the member is an eligible person, the member does not hold another entitlement certificate and the member has completed six months effective full&amp;hyphen;time service after completion of the qualifying period. The entitlement certificate is then valid for 12 months.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The entitlement certificate makes the member eligible for the payment of subsidy of a loan made by the National Australia Bank in accordance with the agreement between it and the Commonwealth. The grant of the loan is subject to normal bank lending criteria. Once the loan has been approved by the bank and the amount of the loan has been advanced, the member is eligible for the payment of a loan interest subsidy by the Commonwealth for crediting the member's loan account, provided the member meets the criteria.

        The main features, as has been adequately outlined by all people who have spoken to the bill, are that we are reducing the eligibility period from six years to five years, that we are raising the maximum amount from $40,000 to $80,000—I would point out that people who already have the $40,000 loan are eligible to top it up—and that the scheme is then extended to certain members of the defence reserves.

        With regard to your specific amendment—again, this is legal advice for you so that you will be able to withdraw your amendment; it is the opinion of the Assistant Secretary of the Legal Services Branch so that you will have it there for you to understand—because of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         these requirements, an earlier date of commencement for the amendments would make no practical effect to the point at which benefits become payable under the scheme or the amount of the benefits. Approval for the enhanced benefits cannot be given until the amendments have been made, even if an earlier date of commencement is included, as you would wish.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To qualify for the enhanced benefits, as for the existing benefits, an eligible member must meet the requirements set out in the act—that is, obtain an entitlement certificate, apply for the loan, obtain the approval and fully comply with the specified criteria. Those processes by their very nature can only operate on a prospective basis. Retrospective commencement of the amendments would not alter this fact. A member can only become eligible for benefits under the scheme when the processes have been completed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        An example will serve to illustrate this position. A member who has an existing subsidy entitlement of $40,000 will become eligible after commencement of the amendments for the increase to $80,000. However, to qualify for the additional subsidy the member must apply for approval for the increase under section 14 of the act, obtain approval of the application under section 15 and meet the lending criteria of the bank for the higher amount. These requirements can be met only after the amendments to the act have been made, that is, after royal assent. Even if the amendments are expressed to commence at an earlier date, no subsidy payment can be made on the higher amount until approval has been given and the eligibility criteria have been met. The increased subsidy cannot be paid for any period prior to the completion of this process which is set out in the act.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A similar analysis can be applied to other amendments included in the bill. For example, even if the amendments relating to reserve members were expressed to commence from a retrospective date, no entitlement could be created until the processes set out above have been completed. The subsidy would be payable on a prospective basis only from the completion of all the eligibility requirements which must be of necessity after royal assent.

         These comments are based on the form of the proposed amendment which has been circulated.

         There was one other point that was raised that I would like to deal with. In his speech during the second reading debate the shadow minister said that we had known long in advance that we would not be meeting the 1 July date which, as I pointed out to him, was only a matter of getting through the vast amount of legislation that had to go through the cabinet. The fact of the matter is that he tried to bolster this by saying that the estimates of take&amp;hyphen;up rate which are in the explanatory memorandum were evidence of this. That was clearly not so and is not so. It is simply a cumulative effect of the take&amp;hyphen;up rate that is anticipated. The figure of $5.7 million for this current year was estimated on a full year and not part of a year. All along the line it was my intention from day one to meet that date. It was simply a matter of physically getting the amount of material that had to be dealt with through the cabinet which only enabled me to bring the bill in on 26 June.

The people who might now currently hold a loan to the current maximum of $40,000, or indeed someone who might apply for a loan today and have it approved prior to the passage of this bill, would be entitled to the maximum current loan of $40,000. Following the passage of this bill, the people in either of those two situations would be eligible to reapply under the terms of the new act. If they were to meet the conditions and therefore be determined as eligible under the new act, they would be able to top up the $40,000 loan that they already had approved to the maximum of $80,000 that this bill would provide. The minister is nodding. I assume that that is an accurate assessment of her comments and in keeping with the legal advice that is here.

         —I am pleased that situation prevails. Of course, it does leave the remaining political difficulty that I think the government is in. That is, whilst that may well be the position in respect of the way the bill operates—I am happy to accept the advice and assurances that have been given by the minister—the politics with which this issue was conducted by the Liberal Party in the lead-up to the election were focused very much on this question of when the bill's passage occurred.

        During the election campaign the Liberal Party courted the service vote by saying to the people in uniform, `We will provide you with better home loan subsidy access and we will do it sooner. You will get the benefit sooner.' That was predicated on a simple understanding of English that is, when someone says, as the Liberal Party policy quite clearly did, that it will take effect by 1 July rather than 1 January, like the Labor Party was going to do, then it actually has some import. It actually meant that a benefit in real terms would accrue to them if they voted Liberal because they would get this benefit and it would apply to them sooner.

        The technical requirements and the information just provided by the minister make plain that there is little, if any, significant advantage gained by passage of the bill in July or August or October. There may well be some delay that would inconvenience some people, but the very heart of the scheme, the very heart of the promise, which was to get people from $40,000 to $80,000, is still there and still available, notwithstanding that royal assent would be months later. Quite simply, in its election propaganda and in its effort to get the uniformed vote, the Liberal Party misled Australia in the way in which they put those propositions. I do not say that lightly.

        As members will know, I have had some fairly extensive involvement with service personnel for some years. They, I must say like I, interpreted the words in their simple English meaning—that they meant what they

         said. It may well be that at the time the Liberal Party actually believed that, too. It may be that the Liberal Party believed that they meant what they said and discovered that they could not do it. I am concerned that that interpretation was widely put across the community and up until now is still widely understood amongst people in uniform to be the case.

         —The Taxation Laws Amendment (International Tax Agreements) Bill seeks to provide the legal authority for an international taxation agreement between the province of Taiwan and the nation state of Australia which was signed on 29 May 1996. The agreement is along the lines of the 36 other agreements currently in force with other countries. The purpose of concluding such agreements is to improve trade and investment flows by agreeing which nation has the rights to tax certain types of income. In this manner the threat of punitive double taxation is overcome. In office, Labor presided over a major expansion in the number of agreements entered into. This agreement is consistent with that process and as such will be supported by the federal parliamentary Labor Party.

Before the election, we said that one thing that could be guaranteed about the member for Mayo and also the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) is that if they took on responsibilities for running Australia's diplomacy they would be noticed in the region. They have been noticed, but in the worst possible way: noticed for incompetency, noticed for mishandling issue after issue, noticed for dragging down Australia's international relations in Asia and noticed for dragging down Australia's trade and investment prospects. Inasmuch as this legislation will cover any attempt by the government to export uranium to Taiwan, those concerns need to be placed on the record.

As my honourable colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has stated, I did express a desire to speak on the bill. I welcome the debate because of what we are doing with our international agreements and how we are going to take certain steps and because it gives me an opportunity to publicly support Taiwan and certainly the continuing close relationship that Australia enjoys with that island.

Overall, Taiwan provided our sixth largest export market in 1995 with something like $3.3 billion worth of Australian exports finding their way to Taipei. Although the trade balance between our two countries is in our favour at the moment, it is not a one&amp;hyphen;way street. Imports from Taiwan were worth about $2.6 billion in 1995. I am trying to be very frank and honest in what we are facing.

        In all areas our links continue to strengthen and to grow. Tourism from Taiwan has grown rapidly since 1990. Air links between our two countries—first opened in 1991—increased some 47 per cent to March 1993. Student numbers from Taiwan increased by over 100 per cent between 1990 and 1995 when it became the seventh largest source market for students visiting Australia.

         Our relationship with Taiwan both economically and diplomatically is strong and the bill before the House is indicative of that. But it has now been tainted by the machinations of the foreign minister who, despite all the warning signs, despite knowing the damage that it would do to our reputation both on an international and a regional level, seems determined to go ahead with his foolhardy scheme to try to sell uranium to Taiwan.

        It was revealed as late as last Friday that our foreign minister felt `very positive'—his words—about uranium sales to Taiwan and that he had directed his department to enter into negotiations to formalise arrangements for the sale. Indeed, it was revealed that, as far back as May this year, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were telling Australian uranium producers that Australia is actively exploring arrangements to allow the supply of Australian uranium to

Never mind that Taiwan is not a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency or the fact that it is not a signatory to the nuclear non&amp;hyphen;proliferation treaty. Never mind that it would contravene  Australia's signing of the South Pacific nuclear&amp;hyphen;free zone treaty. The foreign minister's great idea, his grand Machiavellian scheme, was that he would get around all that by using a convenient `middleman'—the United States—to sell that uranium.

        Australia would get off, he thinks, scot free and the government would laugh all the way to the bank. What deceit! The foreign minister is basically saying to the people of Australia, `We don't care about our international obligations. They aren't worth the paper they are written on. Nor do we care about China. What we want is money for our uranium and we are going to get it any way we can.' Not only that, it is just another sign of how this government defines itself by its relationship with the United States. I am just waiting, as I am sure are many other colleagues on this side of the House, for the very first time that Uncle Sam says to them, `Jump!' and we hear our foreign minister say with a very high squeak, `How high?'

        So that is how we have arrived at the present situation, and that is just a very brief potted history—albeit without including an account of the recent record of the member for Mayo—a history I am sure I do not have to revisit at length for the benefit of honourable members. He is a figure of ridicule in this House, lampooned by the country's political cartoonists. He is an embarrassment to the nation at large. His political career lies in tatters and rags due to his handling of the DIFF scheme debacle. We have seen it all over the papers on where we now stand as a country because of the foreign minister's handling of just that one little thing. Despite his track record and despite his obvious failure to perform, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) continues to inflict him upon not only us but also our neighbours and our trading partners—a matter of no small cause for concern.

         His handling of the question of exporting uranium to Taiwan is just another chapter in his very sorry history. The fact that he has allowed it to rear its ugly head just days after mouthing off about the importance of eliminating nuclear weapons and just days before he was to jet off to meet senior members of the Chinese government, including Premier Li Peng, is indicative of how politically immature and naive and how out of his depth he really is.

The foreign minister now stands revealed as a farcical and superficial politician of the highest order. He said in December 1995 that the Canberra Commission was `nothing more than a political stunt'.

I am saying that, if we are going to do that with one hand—knowing full well that this bill is here for debate today and knowing full well that the foreign minister was aware of it and knowing full well and understanding and appreciating what could be involved if we were to take these other steps as far as trying to sell uranium through the United States back to Taiwan—then I believe these concerns must be brought up.

If we are going to shove it under the carpet, we are going to see a lot more of this. We cannot have it going on ad infinitum.

         I have a particular concern, and I can certainly understand that Australians may want to ask: is it really a problem for us to sell uranium to Taiwan? I will come back to it through this bill, because we are dealing with Taiwan. They may say that it is a very close and trusted ally of Australia. They may say that we enjoy a very strong and thriving trading partnership. Certainly we can trust them with our uranium not to use it for non-energy related purposes. I agree with that, and I would suggest that this is not the issue. It is not the issue at all. Of course Australia trusts Taiwan and vice versa; this bill before the House is indicative of that trust.

         There are issues bigger than trust at stake here. It is what trading uranium means to our relationship with other nations in the region, and that is why I am going to keep on repeating it.

         Australia trusts Taiwan, but by selling uranium to Taipei we would be destroying far more important international relationships than the one that this bill before the House seeks to cement and improve.

Now is not the time, nor is it the place, to discuss China's deep dissatisfaction and disappointment in this government. Of course, I am referring to the DIFF scheme. Suffice it to say, I am sure that our foreign minister's itinerary to China includes plenty of time for our minister to soothe frayed nerves in China and certainly get us out of troubled waters.

        The foreign relationship that we are talking about today is an agreement between the Australian Commerce and Industry Office and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office concerning the avoidance of double taxation—the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income. The people who are going to be affected by this legislation are those who are currently residents of either Australia or Taiwan and who derive income profits and gains from the other territory.

        This agreement has been a long time coming but is an agreement that has been welcomed by both sides. Certainly, the relationship between Australia and Taipei is a strengthening and growing relationship. The current government has expressed a great deal of support for the growing democratic processes in Taiwan, something that seems to be ignored by members on the other side who are more interested in the great march in the Chinese mainland than in the freedoms and struggles that have set up Taiwan as an amazing country which has made great advances in production, democracy and freedom. That is something that the members of the Australia Labor Party tend to ignore and it was ignored by the Labor Party in office. They were always seeking to favour mainland China rather than Taiwan.

        At the same time he made remarks encouraging a greater interest in and a greater bilateral relationship between the two nations. He made some very complimentary remarks about the current government and the processes adopted by the current government. He went on to say that our economies are complementary—that the flow and balance of trade is in Australia's favour by about $600 million, but the total volume of trade is about $4.3 billion.

        The two areas have had a particular growth in education and tourism. It is interesting to note that in 1988 there were only 302 Taiwanese students in Australia. By 1995 the figure had jumped to 3,924—a great increase of 1,300 per cent. In the comparatively short period of eight years, there has been an increase of 1,300 per cent in the number of students involved in Australian study and Australian universities.

        It is also interesting to note that the then minister for education, Mr Koo, led a Taiwanese delegation of more than 60 experts to the first bilateral Taiwanese&amp;hyphen;Australian Conference on Vocational Education and Training, held in Melbourne this May, so at a governmental level there is an increased relationship and an increased interest in the exchange of educational opportunities. This exchange in educational opportunities is also a growing area, because many of the educational opportunities provided for people from the Asian area are in private businesses. There is a need for an understanding of what the tax regime is going to be. In the tourist trade there is also the same need. In tourism alone 21,000 Taiwanese visited Australia in 1989 and the forecast for this year is 179,000. This is an increase of 850 per cent. Visitors' numbers are expected by the year 2003 to reach 380,000.

       <para first-indent="16">
        That volume of exchange is something that really does indicate that a strengthening of formalities and formal links, such as an international tax agreement, is a very significant process. I am delighted that the government has moved ahead with this legislation. It seems sensible and in line with other agreements established between Australia and other countries and territories. There seems

It is an open democracy now, and is a place where Australia should have continuing, expanding relationships.

         —The Taxation Laws Amendment (International Tax Agreements) Bill 1996 was introduced on 27 June 1996.

        The agreement was negotiated by, on Australia's behalf, the Australian Commerce and Industry Office or ACIO—which is Australia's de facto embassy in Taiwan—with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, TECO, which is ACIO's counterpart in Australia. The agreement was signed on 29 May 1996.

        It binds any taxpayer who is a resident of either Australia or Taiwan and who acquires income, gains or profits from the other's territory. This bill will amend the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953, and seeks to prevent double taxation and tax evasion on the various forms of income flows between the two countries. In that, the agreement is quite similar to the agreements with the government of the Czech republic and, indeed, the government of Spain.

        It is also very interesting for its political implications, as previous speakers have already inferred. Although it is a bilateral agreement between Australia and Taiwan, our
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        The Australian government has tried concertedly to ensure that this agreement does not imply a recognition of Taiwan's sovereignty. However, the reality is that Taiwan's sovereignty is recognised. That is the reality. With Taiwan warranting a separate tax agreement, this is an acceptance of independent jurisdiction and, by extension, independent sovereignty. The very fact that the ACIO and TECO organisations exist and operate as de facto embassies, and even negotiate international agreements on behalf of their respective governments, gives substance to the fact that Australia, in reality, does recognise the legitimacy of the Taiwan government, but does so only covertly so as not to upset the people's republic.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The issue of the international status of Taiwan has been one of intense interest since 1973 when Australia recognised the People's Republic of China, referred to briefly as China, as the official government of all China, including Taiwan. This recognition of China as the sole representative of the Chinese people on the mainland and Taiwan was also undertaken by most other Western nations in the 1970s. The United States of America did that in 1979. It was a long&amp;hyphen;term patron of Taiwan until then and was one of the last in that decade of the 1970s.

        Whereas in the Cold War most nations recognised two Germanies and two Koreas, such dual recognition has never been applied to China. This was probably because until recently both governments continued to claim they were the official government for the whole of China. As such, the Republic of China was the recognised government of China for many years, just as the communist People's Republic is now the recognised government.

         This policy position is described, as I am sure you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the One China policy. It is a policy position most governments have been at pains to maintain, if only at a superficial level. It is a question able piece of foreign policy which recognises only one China to the exclusion of the other. Both deserve to be represented in international forums and both should have fully fledged diplomatic relations with Australia.

        Australia's long&amp;hyphen;term economic relations with East Asia would be greatly enhanced if we were able to develop closer economic ties with both Chinas. This would especially be the case if the mainland Chinese economy were to continue its current rapid rate of economic growth and Taiwan were to spend, as projected, billions of dollars on major infrastructure projects. However, it should be said that economic factors should not necessarily be the key criteria determining Australia's relationships with China or Taiwan.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another factor of some importance is the development of democratic processes in both Chinas, and the adherence of those countries to basic human rights. To date, Taiwan has moved, and continues to move, toward a pluralistic democratic state with human rights being given ever greater prominence. It is unjust to deny recognition of a state which has made tremendous progress in basic democratic and human rights over the past decade. Mainland China's human rights record is, of course, less than good—and that is something of an understatement. From the takeover and oppression immediately after 1949, the cultural revolution, the Tiananmen Square massacre and butchery in Tibet, the Chinese government has shown nothing but a flagrant disregard for some of the most basic of human rights.

        While on the issue, I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), for planning to meet with the Dalai Lama in spite of China's objections.

Of course, due to China's opposition to dual recognition, any attempt to further formalise relations with Taiwan could result in Australian firms being given short shrift in China along with a downgrading, no doubt, of our diplomatic relationships. That is to be avoided but not at the expense of kowtowing to the Beijing regime.

        To date we have managed to maintain official relationships with China without totally isolating Taiwan. The question remains: are these unofficial links satisfactory? Obviously there is no definitive solution to that question. Australia considered China to

        We must be able to take part in the commercial opportunities in Taiwan so that we can partake of the obvious benefits it confers on both our economy and Australian businesses. Australia's trade relations with Taiwan to date are very strong. Australia treats Taiwan on a par with all the other signatories to APEC, yet out of respect to China, and a desire to maintain the status quo, relations are officially `unofficial'—a contradiction in terms if ever there was one. Relations have been driven by markets and fear; recognition of obvious trade advantages and fear of Chinese reprisals for actively dealing with Taiwan. So far China has not objected to Australia's more recent policy of two Chinas thinly disguised as a One China policy.

        In 1990 a report by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recommended that Australia establish closer ties with Taiwan. This was followed up with an expansion in unofficial dealings. Direct air services have been established between the two countries, facilitating travel as well as streamlining the visa system for visitors. Australia formally recognised Taiwanese investment in Australia by enacting legislation to protect the right to invest by Taiwanese. In 1992 Taiwanese officials in Canberra were permitted to open the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, a diplomatic privilege normally accorded only to embassies and missions. In Taipei the Australian Chamber of Commerce was just one of many business organisations invited to set up headquarters on Taiwanese soil.

        However, it would be naive of Australia to ignore the Taiwanese imperative to gain relatively independent status. Of course, the reality is that once Taiwan gains membership of the international organisations it seeks to join it will be compelled, through financial necessity and other binding agreements, such as those required by the World Trade Organisation, to eradicate any favoured nation trading agreements. That would have very important implications for taxation and this agreement. For these reasons, Australia must look realistically at the future of Taiwan and trade relationships with that country. In economic terms, Taiwan is more important to Australia than many of the ASEAN members because it is now Australia's third largest export market in Asia.

        The point has been made that Australia's exports, although significant, are largely anonymous in that they are not marketable brand names, and there is concern that Australia's terms of trade could deteriorate if we do not succeed in expanding our exports of conservation technology, education services, processed foods and tourism.

        Ultimately there are two positions that Australia can take on future relations with Taiwan, Mr Deputy Speaker. Either we can continue to follow the status quo of maintaining the former One China policy which recognises the two governments, albeit one of those tacitly, or we can go along with attempts towards recognising Taiwan as the independent nation it undoubtedly is. More recently it seems that the USA is beginning to acknowledge the de facto relationship between China and Taiwan and is, itself, moving slowly towards formal recognition of Taiwan's position.

         Labor government, we had officials go from this country to explore the possibility of uranium sales to Taiwan. Now we have the member for Prospect coming in here giving every indication that the Labor government had nothing to do with it. Now, as the Labor opposition, she says, `Oh goodness gracious me, how horrible,' for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to go over there or make comments that we might entertain the idea of uranium sales to Taiwan.

The minister went on to say there that he was going to facilitate the trade by discussing with the US officials the equivalent of the Canadian&amp;hyphen;US arrangement which enables the US safeguards coverage to apply to Canada's uranium sales to Taiwan following processing in the United States. The member for Prospect raised this issue here on the floor of the House. I am responding and summing up on behalf of the government on this particular issue. It may be that offers were under way in this regard, but it was very clear just over 12 months ago that the previous government were indicating that they were trying to negotiate sales in regard to uranium and Taiwan. Maybe the opposition have changed their minds or maybe they are having a big debate amongst themselves as to whether the Left wants to export uranium, or the Right wants to export it—or maybe they do not have any policy at all on this issue—but to come in here and raise it on this particular issue I think was rather foolish of the member.

There was no plan. That is what he said four days ago—and yet here we have all the evidence in the records indicating that the former foreign affairs minister was directly involved in negotiating on behalf of the Keating government the possibility of sales to Taiwan. The shadow spokesman just four or five days ago is out there saying there was no plan to export it using the United States as a front to avoid our international obligations, when in actual fact that is exactly what the opposition when they were in government were doing. And not only was Mr Evans saying when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs that he was doing all this exploring of it but then a couple of days later Mr Brereton, the shadow minister for foreign affairs, says it was explored for a year or so.

I do not understand that yesterday the Treasurer sought a personal explanation in this place to say it was wrong—to say that he did not send Michael Kroger round to bribe his brother with a job so he would not run for the Democrats in the Senate. If the Treasurer is offended by that—he would have read the article on Saturday—he should make a personal explanation.

          —Thank you. The measures in this Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill concern the ending of sales tax exemption for certain government vehicles—local, state and federal. It is worth the House noting that the states and territories were promised, by the coalition, a fixed share of Commonwealth revenue, and this was going to be done in a way that was revenue neutral and that guaranteed current services. That is what the Treasurer said in a press release on 19 February 1996.

         At the Premiers Conference in June, financial assistance grants—untied grants to the states and territories—were cut by $1.5 billion over the next three financial years. Additionally, specific purpose payments—tied grants—were cut by at least three per cent annually, starting with around $330 million in the current financial year. This is a clear breach of an election promise to the states; the states,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          in many cases, have had no choice but to increase their own taxes.

        <para first-indent="16">
         So we have seen, in several states, the introduction of state Costello taxes. They have suffered a breach; they have been betrayed by the Howard government on their grants. To correct that—the Treasurer himself said it should be revenue neutral—they have taken the revenue neutrality to the point of having to introduce state Costello taxes, and who can blame them? Who can blame them when it was the Treasurer who so badly broke that promise? The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was part of it and yet this is the Prime Minister who before the election said that if he were given a choice between fiscal consolidation and having to break his promises, and of allowing the budget deficit to be larger but keep his promises, he would keep his promises. He said he would keep his promises to the states, local government, taxpayers, and every single Australian citizen at any cost.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This debate has got to the ludicrous point in public morality where you cannot even believe the Howard government's promise to keep its promises. They have reached a new low in morality in public life whereby we are supposed to be thankful for any promise they keep. If they keep a promise, we are supposed to applaud; if they do something that actually accords with what they promised the people of Australia, they are expecting everyone to be thankful.

         I am afraid that this House should have a different standard. We should expect the Prime Minister to keep his promises. We should expect him to keep his promise to keep his promises. And that, of course, was very clear before the election. This is a budget of betrayal. This is a $2 billion net tax grab over the next two years, and it represents absolute betrayal to the people of Australia and this bill is part of it.

         The promise was made to local government prior to the election to maintain their financial capacity, yet they will suffer financially as a product of this legislation.

         All those government members who are now entering the House after their assessment of the budget, and the Prime Minister, who is also coming in, should consult Budget Paper No. 1, turn to page 1.19 and examine the major revenue measures of this government, of which this bill is one. What they will find is that in the current financial year this government will, on the one hand, offer $362 million of tax concessions to Australian taxpayers and on the other rip back $1.3 billion. It will rip back $1.3 billion on its own revenue raising measures, in its own budget document. It is a $1 billion tax grab for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 that converts to $2 billion for the following financial year.

         This is a high tax government. It is high tax Howard according to the budget documents. The Treasurer has shown that he is much more a taxer than an axer; he has done a lot of axing in the budget but much more taxing. This is a Treasurer who said before the election, joined by his Prime Minister, that he was going to make government smaller. How do you make government smaller by increasing tax as a proportion of GDP by 0.4 per cent? How do you make government smaller? How do you fulfil that election commitment to the people of Australia by making the tax revenues larger by almost half a per cent of GDP? This is a government which has, with these tax measures, including the sales tax provisions before the House, betrayed the people of Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It has also betrayed local government with these particular measures by reducing their financial capacity; betrayed the states who have had, in many cases, no choice but to introduce their state Costello taxes; and betrayed the ordinary Australian taxpayer, who, on average, over the next two financial years will be $260 worse off as a product of the Treasurer's $2 billion tax grab. It is a budget of betrayal and, of course, according to this particular bill, a budget of massive disappointment for local government.

I have been listening for the last couple of weeks to the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer talk about slash and burn, saying that the rate of fiscal consolidation planned by the Treasurer is too rapid, that it is draconian, that it is painful, that it is punitive and that it is all these other things. So I listened to the shadow Treasurer on Sunday on

        Just for the record, in case you missed it, the underlying deficit, the true deficit this year, as a result of our deficit reduction strategy, is $5.6 billion. The true deficit next year is only $1.5 billion and in 1998&amp;hyphen;99, which is in three years, as the honourable member would say, we have a balance of just under $1 billion. In other words, he has endorsed in full the fiscal strategy of the Costello budget. I am delighted to say that not only is this the best budget in 20 years but it is the first budget in 20 years to get bipartisan endorsement from the opposition.

Firstly, they were absolutely fed up with you lot opposite. Secondly, they made their decision and they cast their vote against the background of a number of commitments made by me on behalf of the coalition. They voted for a radically better family tax package, and they have got it. They voted for a tax rebate for health insurance, and they have got it in full. They voted for incentives for small business, and they have got those. They voted for the retention of Medicare, and they have got that.

        They also voted for industrial relations reform. That is still being held up in the Senate by the actions of the opposition parties. They voted to get rid of Labor's job destroying unfair dismissal law. They deserve to get that law passed. I say again to every small business man and woman around Australia: if you are reluctant to take on more staff because of the unfair dismissal law, blame the Labor Party and the other party for not having passed that law. In other words, the things the Australian people voted for on 2 March they received overwhelmingly in full credit in the budget delivered last night.

We have attended to a fiscal mess that we inherited from you, we have fixed the budget mess that we inherited, and we have kept the essential commitments that we made on which we were elected. That is a pretty impressive performance.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a far better performance than the first Labor budget in 1983 when every single promise you made was junked. You made no attempt to keep any of them. You junked all of them within a matter of three or four weeks. That is how disreputable you really were. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that if you want to make comparisons in relation to unemployment by all means you go ahead and do so, but remember that the Australian people know your form on unemployment—you have got a lot of it—and all of those people behind you have got a lot of form on unemployment.

This is a budget which delivers important tax relief to families, and it delivers it right down to the lowest income scale. This was an increase in the tax-free threshold to deliver the biggest benefits to those at the lowest end of the income scale. For example, a family with two children qualifying under part (a) and part (b) of the family tax initiative will receive $34 a fortnight. This is a benefit to families with children.

So that commitment, made by the coalition on a number of occasions during election campaigns, is going to be honoured in full.

One of the most remarkable things about the private health insurance debate when those in the Labor Party deride tax incentives for private health insurance as being handouts to the rich is they forget the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of retired Australians who regard the maintenance of private health insurance as an absolute necessity of life.

There is a range of broad developments which are great for rural and regional Australia.

They include the reintroduction of the black spots road program—something you abolished. Something you could not find the money for, we are bringing back in. The restoration of $60 million of CSIRO funding is part of that equation. The woodchip decision, which you did not have the courage to face up to for year after year, is part of the package that this government has produced, and we will deliver further on regional forest agreements. The FBT is a good battlers from the bush decision.

        The first and most important thing that should be said about the government decisions that have had a beneficial impact on the regions of Australia is that the decision that this government took in relation to the woodchip industry has had a massively beneficial effect on many regional parts of Australia.

        One of the reasons why the regional areas of Australia left the Labor Party in droves at the last election is your complete betrayal of them in relation to the woodchip issue. You betrayed them very badly. What we did with the decision on the woodchip industry was to strike a proper balance between concerns for the environment and the recognition that once you destroy industry in some regional parts of Australia—once it has gone—it will never return.

I remind him again of what the Deputy Prime Minister said about $150 million over the period to the year 2000 on the black spots program, of which 50 per cent is going to rural roads. I remind him of the $75 million a year for the Pacific Highway. I remind him of the $33 million for the Bass Strait passenger vehicle equalisation scheme. I remind him of the $48 million to speed up the RFA process. I remind him of the $27 million over the next four years to establish six university departments of rural health.

        The third thing these initiatives will do for health care delivery in Australia is provide very real assistance to the public hospital system. My department estimates that if two per cent of people drop out of private health insurance it puts another 322,000 bed days of demand on the public hospital system. That is like having to have two public hospitals brim full for 365 days a year, just because of the people who have dropped out of private health insurance.

        Also, public hospitals will be able to charge the funds for a greater proportion of patients who are privately insured. We reckon this will bring about $20 million into the public hospitals that we will not seek to recover. Also, doctors will be able to charge Medicare rather than charge the state governments on a fee for service or sessional basis. We reckon this will cost us $15 million. We do not seek to claw any of that back. In the end, it will lead to a stable system that will give people choice.

Why has the government attacked pensioners and the chronically ill through increasing the cost of their essential

         —I was hoping you would ask this. The fact is: you clearly do not understand how public hospitals are funded. In my entire portfolio there were only two things that were saved from an efficiency dividend—research funding and public hospital funding. The fact is that on the four-year forward estimates public hospital funding is entirely untouched, not just the base grants of public hospital funding but case&amp;hyphen;mix development, quality assurance, infrastructure planning, bonus pool, hospital access—they are all untouched. Secondly, we have been putting $35 million a year into it through the private health incentives that we are not going to claw back.

        What you are talking about is a rort. I would like to see you stand up here and defend a rort. I will explain the rort to you because clearly you don't understand it. Under the Medicare system that was presided over by you, states shifted costs onto the Commonwealth. They put patients with their pre&amp;hyphen; and post&amp;hyphen;operative radiology work&amp;hyphen;ups out in the private. They privatised outpatient clinics so&amp;hyphen;called and shifted costs onto the Commonwealth. They put Medicare bulkbilling agencies in hospital casualties—one that I have seen so-called specialising in plaster removals. This cost shifting was completely out of control. We estimate it is going to cost the Commonwealth $400 million a year. That is the rort you are defending. It is completely unjustified.

         —The Prime Minister, John Howard, has also betrayed the low income families who live in Penrith who depend on the Commonwealth's dental health program to make sure that they get their emergency dental care. He has betrayed the low income families who live not just in Penrith, not just in the electorate of Bass, but right across the country, who depend on this basic health care system to make sure that they get reasonable and fair access to good health care in Australia.

        Worst of all, the Prime Minister has betrayed the retired couples who live in electorates such as Moncrieff and other retirement areas right across the country. He has betrayed the retired people who could even live in the electorate of Cowper, Mr Deputy Speaker. They will now have to pay an average of $26,000 as an up-front entrance fee if they wish to go into a nursing home. On top of that, those retired people will now have to pay an extra charge for being in that nursing home. They will be paying up to an extra $34 a day, depending on a means test. I admit that full&amp;hyphen;rate pensioners will not pay it, but any part&amp;hyphen;rate pensioner or any person whose income means they get no pension will be up for the additional fee because of the new means test on the government's subsidy for nursing homes.

         As a result of all these measures, this is a mean budget. It is a mean budget for all of these reasons. Far from it being a budget for mainstream Australia, as claimed by the Prime Minister as he trumpets his press releases and appears on radio, the Prime Minister really knows that this is a budget that hurts ordinary working families. It hurts their parents and it is also going to hurt their kids.

         The Prime Minister's mainstream Australia is still standing behind that white picket fence somewhere in a leafy street, probably on the North Shore of Sydney, where a family is going to get greater benefits than the battlers who are living in electorates such as Lindsay—the battlers where both parents are working in places such as St Clair. John Howard's mainstream Australia might include a family where one parent is working and perhaps the one bread earner is a professional and he gets a company car. That North Shore family will get a bigger tax cut than the battling working family in the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne.

         Child care is not essential for that North Shore family, where only one parent is working. Both parents do not need to work just to make ends meet, as is the case out in St Clair. The family that lives on the North Shore may well have parents who have retired up to the electorate of Robertson. They might be living on the water at Pearl Beach in a nice but expensive house, with a reasonable nest egg left over. That family will be able to afford the up&amp;hyphen;front fee if ever any of them need to go into a nursing home. They can afford the new higher nursing home charges.

They will now have to cope with longer waiting lists, not just for hospitals but also for emergency dental care, because this Minister for Health and Family Services has scrapped the Commonwealth's dental health program. They could be living within a very tight budget where most of the super

For example, what if only one member of the couple needs to go into a nursing home? You don't expect the remaining partner to leave the family home? You don't expect them to sell up their family home to pay that $26,000? Surely, we are not at the stage where the Liberal Party are telling battling pensioner couples that they have to sell their home so one of them can afford the up&amp;hyphen;front fee for the nursing home. In addition, they are going to have to cope with that up to $34 a day cost increase for a nursing home place.

         In question time, the minister for health made a great song and dance about the fact that the Liberal Party, having finally won government, had the great chance to implement their health policies. For 13 years they have been telling us that the magic wand that will solve every problem in health care is to provide incentives for private health insurance. For 13 years they have been telling us, `If you just give us a go, we will fix the problems.' In fact, this minister for health was running around before the election saying that through his health policy he would get the number of Australians in private health insurance back up to 40 per cent of the population. Remember that, Minister? You did not mention that number of 40 per cent today because last night's budget papers contained the most astounding backdown, a backdown of breathtaking proportions.

He is such a generous man that he will let the public hospitals keep that extra $20 million!

         The minister for health and the Prime Minister must be the only two people in Australia who think state public hospitals have got too much money. Your decision last night—the decision in this document that was tabled last night—claws back $310 million from public hospitals around the country, and you know it. That is $310 million that could be used to reduce waiting lists right across the country.

         It is not just the decisions that were announced last night; in the Premiers Conference we had the federal government slashing funding to the states by $1&amp;half; billion. Since the health budget makes up about a third of the states' budgets, it is clear that that will have a significant impact on the ability of the state governments to fund their public hospitals. There are a whole series of measures that we are concerned about.

We say to the minister: here is a challenge for you. If you want us to vote for the concessions you are granting for private health insurance, scrap the $310 million cut to public hospitals and, instead of that, put a significant injection of money into our public hospitals, so that we know we are encouraging not just private health insurance, private hospitals and private medicine, but also all of those Australians who rely on public hospitals for their essential health care.

They know what it means to shut down the Medicare offices in regional Australia. We know what it means when you cut back funding for public hospitals by $310 million.

         I had my go at dealing with that issue, but I think it's a bit of a time bomb for the health system. And we won't keep Medicare if we don't keep reforming it. I believe we've got too many GPs out there in the field ordering up too many services.
        </para>
        <para>
         Those two quotes were made by two former Labor Party cabinet ministers. The first one, about private health insurance, was made by Graham Richardson in February this year. The second quote was by Brian Howe, a former health minister and Labor Deputy Prime Minister, in April this year.

         The fact is we have very substantial problems in our health system. If they are not addressed, it means we have a system that we simply will not be able to have in a decade's time. The problems are fairly simple. They are one of costs that are increasing at a rate we cannot afford. The Medicare benefits schedule is a $6.2 billion program. That is more than the entire budget of the state of Western Australia.

So we simply had no option but to do something about it if we wish to retain Medicare, and we do. Similarly, the pharmaceutical benefits system, a $2.2 billion program, is going up 11 per cent compound a year. No government expenditure can cope with that sort of compound increase.

We are not supporting private health insurance for any ideological reason. We are not supporting it because we choose this over the public system. We are supporting it for the very simple reason that unless you have a system where public and private can co-exist our health system will not survive. Again in the

         The problem with that is that we have been losing about two per cent of the population out of private health insurance net per year. Some come in, but far more go out. The net effect is two per cent. Every time people drop out, it does two things. It means more people have to use the public hospital system, so there is a greater demand for beds, and it shifts costs from the Commonwealth to the states in that there are fewer doctors drawing on Medicare but they are drawing sessional payments from the states or fee-for-service from the states. My own department estimates that that is equivalent to two big city public hospitals brimful 365 days a year every year compounded just from the two per cent who drop out each time.

         I am aware of the 40 per cent figure that the shadow minister uses. I know where it came from. It came from the Access Economics document that we released before the last election because they costed our policy. To be honest with you, I remember it very well because I was angry. Every percentage increase that was estimated meant more money I had to find to fund the initiative. It would have been in our interest to shoot low because it would have cost less to fund. But we accepted what Access Economics said and we funded it to the dollar as they said it. On every occasion that I talked about this—and the shadow minister can check it—I always qualified the figure by saying, `This is what has been estimated by Access Economics. We may or may not achieve it.'

         Control of state&amp;hyphen;Commonwealth cost shifting is critical if we are going to contain costs in diagnostic imaging. Cost shifting occurs because federal Medicare is an uncapped program while the Commonwealth health grants to the states are capped. As the states confront their budget realities in the light of ever increasing demand for health care dollars, the temptation to transfer patients into Commonwealth funding streams is overwhelming. Double dipping occurs when state health grant funded public hospital resources are utilised to provide services to private patients which are then charged to Medicare. Cost shifting and double dipping are endemic structural problems that will continue indefinitely unless the Commonwealth acts decisively.

That hospital has now set up 62 so-called private outpatient clinics and bills the Commonwealth for something that they have historically done. This is completely contrary to the Medicare agreements.

The problem with this is that the states will put $10 of costs onto the Commonwealth to save $1 of costs themselves. This cost shifting threatens the very essence of Medicare. If it is not addressed, we will not have Medicare survive. So I make no apology for addressing it. In the context of overall hospital funding the simple fact is that the entire Medicare agreement is preserved. That is not just the base grants for the hospital but all the add-ons, the bonus pool arrangement, the quality assurance programs. The other parts of Medicare have no cut to them whatsoever.

The Commonwealth has kept paying it at the old level. But in spite of that argument, we made a conscious decision to single out two areas—medical research, because of its importance, and public hospital funding, to preserve the entire funding over the four years under the Medicare agreement.

In my own state of Victoria, people had to wait for three years to get basic dental care—three years for a filling; three years so that you could eat decent food.

        There is no better example than the one used by the government in the budget to laud their family tax initiative.

This family is actually going to need almost four times this amount to cover the increase in the cost of child care announced in this budget. Such a family using community child care can expect to lose at least $14 per child per week—so for two children, $28—in operational subsidies alone. Before we even start, that family has just gone backwards by at least $20 a week.

        The implications for child care around this country are very serious. We will no longer have a community based child-care sector. We will no longer have that choice for parents in our system. We will have parents having to pay between $14 and $20 a week more for child care per child. That is not the sort of increase that this family tax initiative takes into account at all. There is no doubt whatsoever that this budget breaks the promise to working Australian families. They were certainly betrayed by this and many other decisions.

He seems to have forgotten what his own health policy was at the last election. I remember thinking that Labor was pretty smart when it came out with providing some package to assist with private health insurance because it had never done so before. However, what it did was leave people out. Labor left out the elderly, the single, the chronically ill and couples without children.

He said at the time that the upgrading of existing stock may cost as much as $520 million. He also pointed out the lack of incentives to maintain good quality nursing home stock. Eighteen per cent of residents were living in rooms with five or more beds and toilets were not large enough to allow carers or walking frames in with the resident.

Their needs are quite different from the needs of those with obvious physical frailties or disabilities. There is general agreement that there must be some measure of assessment. The emphasis has been on physical rather than mental health. There are about 14 questions which must be answered and they go something like this: is the patient incontinent; what about the skin integrity; what special nursing is required; is there any physical aggression, verbal disruption, behaviour problems, vision impairment or speech apprehension; what is their mobility; what are their toilet requirements; and what are their washing and dressing requirements, eating requirements and their level of independence?

          This classification for nursing home residents equals nursing home hours, which in turn, up to now, has equalled dollars.

He is not incontinent; he is not physically aggressive; and he is not verbally disruptive. Therefore, he scores few points, few nursing hours and few dollars, but in fact he requires one&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;one care for between three and six hours per day. Prior to his admission to the nursing home, he received 24&amp;hyphen;hour care which was HAC funded and therefore a cost also to the community.

          This was the Labor system and now they complain when we want to change it and make things better. The changes that we have put in place in this budget will take place on 1 July 1997 and these changes are in response to the needs and include unifying nursing home and hostel systems into a single residential aged care system. I cannot think of a single better plan to have in place for those ageing Australians.

          Also, in many cases the spouse who will not be admitted to a nursing home might require hostel accommodation. Can you imagine two people who have lived together in a close family relationship for perhaps 50 or 55 years, or even less than that, one being in a hostel one side of town and the other being in a nursing home somewhere else? We need to be able to bring these types of facilities together, because it is showing that we care about the whole person and having some plans for the future.

          As I have said, in the past it has been okay to pay to get into a hostel but not to get into a nursing home. But the level of care has come closer together. Once those living in hostels were fairly fit, but as the criteria and the lack of beds have become more evident it has become closer. So now you get told quite often that those who were once being cared for in nursing homes are in fact being cared for in hostels. We need to be able to bring those systems together, and we will do that.

        This bill makes various amendments to the Defence Act and Naval Defence Act, together with consequential amendments to the Air Force Act and other Commonwealth legislation. All the amendments are associated with ongoing improvements to command and administration arrangements for the Australian Defence Force.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition came to government with a commitment to improving the management of Australia's defence. Central to achieving this commitment is ensuring that the command structure of the Defence Force is appropriate for Australia's present and future national security requirements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        New arrangements for the command of the Defence Force are being introduced in stages. It is an objective of this process to delineate more clearly the responsibilities of the various levels of command and to ensure in particular that responsibility for operations is vested in the proposed Headquarters Australian Theatre.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In association with the organisational changes, it is necessary to change the designations and titles of various components of the organisation. This bill introduces new titles for the heads of the three services. The changes to the titles, from chiefs of staff to Chief of Navy, Chief of Army and Chief of Air Force, recognise the continuing role of the service chiefs as commanders of the navy, army and air force with that role set in the framework of the new command structure.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         The Chief of the Defence Force, General John Baker, announced the planned changes to the command arrangements in January 1996. These changes, to be introduced be tween now and the year 2000, will further refine the Defence Force's command capability at the strategic and operational levels. When complete, the revised arrangements will allow flexibility when planning for, and committing, the Defence Force to operations. Importantly, they will also introduce a structure that is identical in times of peace and war.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A key element of the changes is the incorporation of the navy, army and air force offices in Canberra into the Headquarters Australian Defence Force as component headquarters. This happened on 1 July 1996 when the navy, army and air force offices were retitled Navy, Army and Air Force Headquarters respectively. The title changes for the service chiefs naturally flow from their modernised command role in this new structure.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second set of amendments deals with the transfer of personnel between the services. At present, there is no legislative provision for the direct transfer of personnel from one service to another. Such a transfer requires formal separation from one service, then appointment to, or enlistment in, the other service. This is a cumbersome procedure and administratively costly. These amendments are designed to streamline the administration of transfers by enabling the direct transfer of personnel between the services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The new transfer power is vested with the chief of the service that is losing the member. The consent of a transferred member is required, and the chief of the service that is to gain the member must also agree. An instrument of transfer would specify the rank, seniority and period of appointment or enlistment that are to apply on transfer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is a provision to ensure that any return of service obligation applying to a transferred member will continue to apply after the transfer. A further provision ensures that service in the losing service is counted as service in the gaining service for purposes such as the calculation of leave entitlements. A service chief can delegate a power to authorise or approve a transfer under these provisions, but not to an officer holding a rank below that of brigadier or the equivalent.
       </para>
       <break page="3410" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The third set of amendments is to provisions which require 12 months service by certain officers after they are promoted. Under existing provisions, the service chiefs may reject the resignation of an officer who holds the substantive rank of colonel, or equivalent, or higher where the officer has not completed a period of 12 months service since being promoted to that rank.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These provisions are designed to increase efficiency by reducing the posting turbulence caused by officers who accept promotion and then resign shortly afterwards. Curbing this practice facilitates smoother personnel management with less disruption to family life and allows substantial savings in removal and associated costs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The same considerations apply to officers who accept promotion to the substantive ranks of major, or equivalent, or lieutenant colonel or equivalent. The provisions are accordingly widened to enable the relevant service chief to reject the resignation of an officer who holds the substantive rank of major, or equivalent, and above where the officer has not completed a period of 12 months service in the rank since being promoted to it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The final set of amendments enables the delegation of the power of the Governor&amp;hyphen;General to make limited tenure promotions. In 1995, defence legislation was amended to enable the Governor&amp;hyphen;General to make promotions for fixed periods—limited tenure promotions. The effect of such a promotion is that an officer is retired on completion of the period unless offered an extension or, alternatively, further service at the original rank level. These provisions are intended to allow for a limited number of promotions to colonel, or equivalent rank or above where an individual has skills relevant to a particular appointment rather than skills that will enable continued employability at the higher rank level. Limited tenure promotions are for a set period, normally three years, and may be declined by the officers concerned.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Governor&amp;hyphen;General has delegated his general powers to promote officers in the Defence Force, but the current delegation provisions do not cover limited tenure promotions. The amendments accordingly enable the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Governor&amp;hyphen;General to delegate the power to make limited tenure promotions. The delegations may be to only the Chief of the Defence Force or a service chief.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I indicated earlier, these rather disparate amendments are linked in that they are all part of the continuing effort to improve the management of the Defence Force. I am confident that the House will support the legislation as part of that effort. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.

        Schedule 1, item 41, page 14 (lines 11 to 17), omit proposed subsection 8(1A).
       </para>
       <para>
        This amendment is to delete proposed subsection 8(1A) from item 41. The reasons for wanting an amendment to this particular subsection of the act are as follows. As indicated in the debate in the Main Committee, proposed subsection 8(1A) would, in effect, make it extraordinarily difficult for the Attorney-General to provide assistance in the case of a request by a foreign country for assistance under the act related to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with or convicted of an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed in the foreign country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As debated in the Main Committee—I do not want to rehash the entire debate—this proposed subsection would make it virtually impossible in relation to the prosecution of a person in a foreign country where the death penalty may be imposed and Australian interests are at stake. Let us take, for instance, the country of Thailand, where a considerable number of statutes involve capital punishment as a penalty. The last part of that particular clause states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . unless the Attorney-General is of the opinion, having regard to special circumstances of the case, that the assistance requested should be granted.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, the only circumstances in which that assistance would be granted are ones in which the Attorney-General, in accordance with the policy enunciated in the explanatory memorandum, was able to get an assurance that the death penalty, if imposed, would not be carried out or, for instance, where the assistance sought by the request is of an exculpatory nature—in other words, would be to try and have the person acquitted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The problem in relation to a number of our immediate neighbours is that it would be highly unlikely that they would give an
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         assurance of this sort. We have in relation to the United States a similar situation where there are federal and state statutes providing for the death penalty in certain cases and where a similar situation would be difficult, although I have been advised that in the case of the United States that assurance may be easier to obtain than in the case of other countries that are more close in our region.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The purpose of my amendment is to remove that requirement—in other words, that blanket ban which it effectively in practice will almost be—and to provide for the discretion of the Attorney-General, which is provided for in proposed subsection 8(1B). In other words, even though the provisions of proposed subsection 8(1A) will have been removed by my amendment, there is still built into proposed subsection 8(1B) the provision for the exercise of the Attorney-General's discretion in cases where, for instance, the Australian government may believe the refusal of a request should take place.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I suppose the nub of this debate over the amendment will be whether or not the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) concedes that proposed subsection 8(1A) may amount to a significant impedance of our international fight against drug trafficking because of the likely imposition it puts in the way of our relations with some of our South&amp;hyphen;East Asian neighbours in particular and, secondly, whether or not he accepts the fact that in proposed subsection 8(1B) that discretion is still built in to provide him the opportunity of being able to refuse assistance where the policy objectives of his government are not met by the country requesting that assistance.

         The matter raised by the member for Moore (Mr Filing) is really the only point of conten tion. The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act has been in operation for about 10 years. It was the subject of a review, which was very wide ranging, involving consultation with prosecution and investigation agencies, law societies, bar councils, the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Law Reform Commission and representatives of civil liberties groups.

        Subclause 8(1A) provides that the Attorney-General must refuse a request for assistance from a foreign country if it relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with or convicted of an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed in the foreign country unless the Attorney-General is of the opinion, having regard to the special circumstances of the case, that the assistance requested should be refused.

        The subsection therefore only applies where charges carrying the death penalty have already been laid or a person has already been convicted of an offence carrying the death penalty. In this situation the request must be refused, except in special circumstances. The subsection creates a general rule that assistance will be refused but an exception where the Attorney is of the opinion there are special circumstances.

        As a matter of practice, the requesting country would be asked to give an assurance that the death penalty, if imposed, would not be carried out.

        Subclause 8(1B) in the same clause provides that a request by a foreign country for assistance under the act may be refused if the Attorney-General believes that provision of the assistance may result in the death penalty being imposed on a person and, after taking

         into consideration the interests of international criminal cooperation, is of the opinion that in the circumstances of the case the request should not be granted.

        It is clear from the terms of subclause 8(1A) that the subsection gives the Attorney-General a discretion to grant assistance where charges have been laid if there are special circumstances arising in a particular matter. The explanatory memorandum notes that the usual practice will be to require the other country to give an undertaking that the death penalty, if imposed, will not be carried out but this is not written into the subsection and therefore does not constitute the only circumstance in which a request might be granted.

        There will be, and it is desirable, some flexibility to enable the Attorney-General to grant assistance where an undertaking is not given, as indicated in the explanatory memorandum. A very good example would be where the assistance sought may be of an exculpatory nature. This amendment proposed by the member for Moore is not supported by the opposition and is not supported by the government.

         —I just want to enlarge on the matter in response to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams). The Attorney says that my interpretation of the second part of proposed subsection 8(1A) is incorrect. One can only rely on the explanatory memorandum as a guide. Nothing is written into that subclause to provide a guide in itself. In other words, those special circumstances would presumably rely on the policy of the government of the day.

         My view is that, under the circumstances that I suppose I have described earlier, there will be a number of instances when some of our neighbouring countries which have, perhaps,  similar aspirations as do we for combating drug trafficking in our region would find that particular requirement—as it is practically implemented in terms of policy as enunciated in the explanatory memorandum—a gross impediment to cooperation with Australia. As we know and as I spelled out in the Main Committee, the drug trafficking problem in Australia is part of an international problem. Drug trafficking by its nature is a transnational procedure involving people from different countries and involving the transportation of illicit drugs from one place to another.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is quite clear from any reading of the most recent material that, in order to combat drug trafficking in this country, Australia is desperately required to participate as fully as possible in international efforts to overcome drug trafficking around the world but, most importantly, in our region. I am referring particularly to countries in our region. I mentioned in the Main Committee that it is ironic that we provide military training to personnel of the Indonesian armed forces who have killed their own innocent citizens in demonstrations and the like, yet if you have, say, a major drug trafficker arrested in Indonesia—or, for that matter, in Thailand—Australia would not provide assistance unless the government concerned provided the assurance that the death penalty would not be carried out.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is my understanding that that assurance could not be given in a number of instances. Certainly if the boot were on the other foot and we were the country concerned and we had the death penalty that would be the case—you could not give an assurance. Therefore, in terms of mutual assistance, we would not be able to fulfil what I consider to be our obligations within the sorts of international cooperative agreements we have with those countries. Bearing in mind that our drug problem is essentially a South&amp;hyphen;East Asian drug problem, if you combine that with the cuts that have been applied in the case of the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          AFP, the NCA and the Customs Service, the totality of all that is that we are going to see another impedance in the effort to combat drug trafficking in this country. I would have thought, under the circumstances, that is something that the majority of the community in Australia would be totally and utterly opposed to.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All I am saying is that my amendment would remove the total ban which it almost in essence is. It would provide that discretion in proposed subsection 8(1B). The Attorney says proposed subsection 8(1B) is not relevant to this case but, if you read it, it says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A request by a foreign country for assistance under this Act may be refused if the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General:

        <para>
         Clearly that would, in my view, cover the situations which I described earlier. I am repeating myself in saying that if, for instance, there were a repetition of the Oklahoma bombing in the United States and there were some Australian connection then one could argue, perhaps successfully, that Australia may well refuse assistance to the United States government in detecting suspects or providing information or evidence that might lead to the apprehension, arrest and prosecution of the persons responsible for terrorism.

         —The government is well aware of the implications of the provisions under debate for international cooperative efforts. There has been a similar policy applied for some years and it has not, up to now, resulted in significant impediment to the success of international cooperation. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) should bear in mind that we are concerned here only with the exercise of coercive powers. We are concerned also with the possibility of not only foreign nationals but also Australian citizens being the subject of a charge.

         condoned. The point of this debate is that there comes a point at which Australia has to stand up for the values it proclaims. One of the relevant values is our internationally stated opposition to the death penalty. The point where we should stand up is where there are no special circumstances in a matter where charges which carry the death penalty in the requesting country have been laid and the country refuses to give an assurance that the death penalty will not be carried out. That is a circumstance in which, ordinarily, government policy would require that the request be refused.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As the member for Moore is no doubt aware, the death penalty has been abolished in all Australian jurisdictions since 1984. In addition, Australia is a party to the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which commits Australia to an anti&amp;hyphen;death penalty position at the international level. I do not apologise in any way for saying that, where special circumstances such as the need for exculpatory evidence do not exist and where the other country will not give an assurance it will not carry out the death penalty, we should refuse assistance. It is entirely consistent with our national opposition to the death penalty to do so.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Where no special circumstances exist and the other country declines to give the undertaking, we cannot escape the fact that Australia could be giving assistance which could assist another country to execute a person. I do not say that in the future that assistance, if this legislation is passed in the proposed form, would never be given, but it would be a very rare circumstance. Australia considers the death penalty as abhorrent, and it would be inconsistent with this position for us, indirectly, to assist another country in condemning a person to death.

        It is also of some assistance to those involved in the negotiations with foreign countries, in relation to mutual assistance in criminal matters, that Australia is able to state its position clearly.

         —I want to answer two things. The first thing is that my understanding is that the assurance in this particular form has never been sought before. So I am not entirely sure how one can relate to the experience in some other format under the previous administration.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second thing is that there are a number of concerns from some of our neighbours. I recollect very clearly a conference on organised crime in Sydney in 1994, at which delegates from law enforcement agencies in other countries were very strident in their criticism of Australia. These were countries that we would rely on very heavily in drug trafficking investigations and information exchange. That is a serious concern. It is serious enough to the extent that I would have thought it would amount to an impedance of some note. They certainly felt it was and, in the discussions in Sydney, they felt that it was something that Australia should deal with. I say to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) that I am pleased that he is endeavouring to codify it in the act, because my understanding was that under previous circumstances it was an informal policy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="3415" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         The other aspect of his argument was that he said it is a clear enunciation of Australia's position for the purposes of foreign countries making requests or considering requests. In actual fact, if you read carefully, the enunciation is not clear. The special circumstances are only described in the explanatory memorandum and, presumably, they would change when the government's policy changed. So, in essence, a country that is endeavouring to seek assistance from Australia is going to have the same problem. It will rely, obvious ly, on whatever the policy is at a particular time.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Therefore, the argument that it is explicit—in other words, a country would be in absolutely no doubt as to Australia's position—is not entirely accurate as, of course, it would rely on the position at the particular time of the Australian government in order for a foreign government to be able to establish whether or not its request for assistance is likely to succeed. Under those circumstances, I commend the amendment.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, 5 Aviation Regiment operates 27 Black Hawk helicopters, along with five Iroquois UH&amp;hyphen;1H and four Chinook CH&amp;hyphen;47D helicopters at RAAF Base Townsville. Corrosion has been detected in the Black Hawk air frame during servicing and there is potential for similar corrosion problems in the Chinook helicopters. In response to these problems, a corrosion prevention strategy has identified the need for helicopter washing and shelter facilities to arrest the

          corrosion and enhance the fleet's sustainability.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Department of Defence proposes to construct an  advance wash facility and environmental shelter equipped with dehumidification equipment for Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters to reduce corrosion caused by operation and open storage of the helicopters in salt&amp;hyphen;laden atmospheric conditions. Degradation of the helicopters, caused by high temperatures and exposure to UV radiation, will also be reduced and the shelters will also reduce OH&amp;S problems associated with personnel working on the helicopters in the tropical sun.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is also proposed to refurbish a helicopter arming area and relocate 5 Aviation Regiment's transport and vehicle workshop facilities to within the existing regimental precinct to enhance operational efficiency. The estimated outturn cost is $21.332 million. It is anticipated that construction will start in May 1997 and be completed by December 1988. I commend the motion to the House.

         —It is not often that a government breaks promises both before and after the election. Before the March election, the coalition promised there would be no new taxes and no existing taxes would be bulked up. After the election, on 12 March the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said that the fiscal consolidation would be by way of outlay reductions. He said that it was the end of days of waste and sloth. What he really meant to say and what is reflected in the budget is that it was the beginning of the days of higher taxing in Australia.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is a measure of the government's betrayal of its promises before and after the election to note that, under its major revenue measures for 1996&amp;hyphen;97, there is no less than $1.3  billion in revenue raising measures. For the following financial year, 1997&amp;hyphen;98, that increases to $2&amp;half; billion. Who in this country will ever believe a single word that John Howard or Peter Costello say? Before the election they promised no bulking up of existing taxes and no new taxes. We now have a budget, including the measure before the House on sales tax, that includes $1.3 billion of new revenue raising measures in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 and $2.5 billion new revenue raised off the tax base for 1997&amp;hyphen;98—a budget of betrayal, a budget of absolute gross deceit.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         For the local government sector affected by these sales tax provisions, the deceit is particularly harmful. This is a government that said they would not run down the financial capacity of local government. Yet, at the Premiers Conference a few months ago, the Treasurer was trying on a half billion dollar tax grab at the expense of local government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the budget delivered last night local government resources are being run down in regional development. The National Party has sold out. The National Party has pulled down the shutters on the idea that the Commonwealth has any legitimate or constitutional role in regional development. It makes you wonder what role the National Party itself could play in the Commonwealth parliament. If they don't believe in regional development what do they believe in? We have a National Party that does not believe in regional development from the Commonwealth!
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Beyond that the abolition of flood mitigation funding is a major burden now that local government will need to meet in its own right. The employment programs, the new work opportunities program, LEAP, and the Greening Australia programs are another diminution of local government resource capacity. The loss of operational subsidies for long day care is a burden on local government and the abolition of building better cities is a burden on regional Australia and local government in general. So local government has not fared well out of the Treasurer's attempt to grab half a billion dollars of extra revenue. That was blocked by the Premiers and it has led to the measure now before the House, which is undoubtedly in breach of coalition election promises on two fronts. The first, the promise not to bulk up existing taxes, has been broken because this is a bulking up of the sales tax regime in Australia. The second promise, not to touch local government financial capacity, has been broken as well. It is a double whammy of deceit and betrayal of core coalition election promises. What assistance did local government receive from the member for Bass, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith)? Very little assistance indeed.

           Notice Paper
          </emphasis>
          , which he has now answered, on the role he took with the cabinet decision to apply all sales tax to local government. With regard to representations to prevent the Treasurer's announcement, he said, `It is not my position to prevent any government policy nor to act on behalf of one particular sector against government policy.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If he is not a minister for local government acting on behalf of local government, he is taking his pay every month under false pretences. What sort of minister is it who doesn't see his role around the cabinet table as being to try to stand up for his part of the Commonwealth sector?
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This is a very poor performance and excuse by the minister, Warwick Smith. The truth is that the Howard cabinet made a decision to grab half a billion dollars of financial capacity off local government. The minister for local government said it was not within his role to prevent that, to oppose it, to stand up for the local government sector. So all of those 800 councils around Australia will be dismayed that they have such a weak and ineffective minister representing their interests in the federal parliament.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          They have further cause for concern, not just because of the budget and the loss of financial capacity, but because of the spectre that hangs over their heads from the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit. That is the audit report that the government still has under active consideration. That is part of the budget documents. Do not let anyone around the Commonwealth, the states or the local government sector think they have seen the last of the National Commission of Audit; no way in the world. It is still under active consideration in the budget papers. We will be receiving, as a parliament—and I think the public will receive—reports on an ongoing basis over the next 12 months. The worst, I fear, is yet to come.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          For local government, the recommendation was to abolish the residual local government development program. Not only has the government halved that program, but the audit commission has recommended its full abolition and, beyond that, to integrate local
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           government financial assistance grants into revised state government payments—that is, to end direct Commonwealth assistance for local government. So with a government that made a cabinet decision to rip half a billion dollars off local government without compensation and to do it through the sales tax regime, one would not be surprised if they were to adopt that audit commission report to roll local government financial assistance into payments to the states. The Baulkham Hills council, local government in Tasmania or local government in the City of Brisbane would have no guarantee that they would see a single dollar of those grants once they were handed on to the states.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The direct grants should remain. The minister, far from rolling over to the Treasurer and the dries around the cabinet table, should be in the business of standing up for local government. If he had stood up for local government, the sales tax impact of this provision would not be felt, the cabinet decision would not have been made, the audit report would have already been dismissed, and none of those harsh impacts on local government in last night's budget would be before the parliament.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So there is cause for concern on every front in this legislation, as is noted in the amendment I have placed before the House. There is cause for concern that a government would so wilfully break its promises so soon after an election. The Prime Minister said that he would reverse what he saw as the decline in standards in public life in Australia and that he could be trusted. He tried to promote the label of `honest John'. He has been shown as nothing more than `dishonest John'—totally dishonest. He made promises with no intention whatsoever of keeping them.

It has been the government's decision that there will be an amendment to the sales tax act with a view to placing on state and local governments—all governments, in fact—a sales tax in respect of certain vehicles and parts of those vehicles purchased by governments or government authorities where the vehicles are wholly or partly for private use as part of an employee's remuneration. They are part of an employee's remuneration; they are not graders, tractors or the vehicles that are used in local government or state government to deliver services.

I indicated that the opposition will continue as a body, as a group, each shadow minister playing his own role, to misrepresent the views of the government. That is the attitude and tactic of the opposition. From when they first went into opposition they disclaimed any responsibility for their past actions, any responsibility for the $8 million black hole and all the mess and chaos and unemployment they created. They then proceeded to blame the government for their own actions. That process of misleading is a corporate effort. It is not one individual; they are all the same.

        The whole process of endeavouring to mislead the Australian public has been part of the strategy of attacking the budget. It has been part of the strategy here in the House with this sales tax legislation, which is doing nothing more than putting into place the proposals put forward on 11 June and then further refined by a subsequent process on 14 June, a press release by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). The measure is expected to raise between $50 million and $100 million—not the huge amounts that the opposition spokesman has used.

        That is what I say is part of an opposition approach to mislead the parliament, the Australian people, in an endeavour to frighten them and change their minds by what the government has done. But it will not wash because the Australian people trust John Howard. They know the mess that you have created as a Labor Party. They know that it is going to be hard to fix it up. When we try to fix it up they say: `They have to be given a

         chance to fix it up.' So all the attempts to claim that there are lies and broken promises just will not wash. The attempt to say that the amendments to the sales tax law are a broken promise or a lie is not true. It is just an attempt to mislead on your part. The Australian people will not wear that.

        I note that the amendment proposed by the opposition says that the provisions are part of a series of broken promises. I refute that and reject that completely. It is completely untrue. This is a fair and strong budget that the government has brought down. The changes to sales tax laws bring in only a marginal amount of money to the government but are necessary to prevent the abuse of the sales tax exemptions given to state and local authorities where an individual, as part of their remuneration package, can buy a car through the state or local government authority, take it on board, resell it and take advantage as part of the resale price of an increase in the value of that vehicle because sales tax then comes back onto the vehicle or is implicit in the retail price of the vehicle. Surely to goodness the opposition is not proposing that we condone that process—

        There is a broader issue about the mishandling of the Premiers Conference. I thought it was a successful Premiers Conference and one in which all states for once agreed that there needs to be fiscal restraint on the part of the Commonwealth. Despite previous Premiers Conferences, the Commonwealth for once has come out and said that there are problems, there is a deficit, there is unemployment, we have to regain our credit ratings and we will only do that if we take the lead as a Commonwealth. For the first time the Commonwealth has taken the lead in its own budget and has cut its outlays and managed to present an example which, judging by the quick response from Standard and Poor's, has gained a result that was never possible under the previous administration of the country. Standard and Poor's never responded to any of the budgets of the Australian Labor Party the way they have responded to this budget. We are building a record that we are going to be proud of.

        As a result of last night's budget and the response by the markets it is going to cost less to run government in Australia. By a change in credit ratings we are going to be able to reduce the costs, the premiums, that have been raised against the Australian government because of our poor financial status. The honourable member opposite shakes his head but that is the fact of the matter. The dropping of the AAA rating down to the AA plus rating means it costs the Australian taxpayer extra money to have its government exist. This is part of the process. This sales tax collection is very much in line with the philosophy and intentions of the current government.

        I have looked back over the files, and I have thought about the claim the Labor Party made today in the House about broken promises. I thought my memory was good, but I checked and found out about the list of Labor broken promises. One Labor pamphlet said: `Labor's tax promise. What I am promising is not to put up tax'. That was what Paul Keating said in 1992. What happened after that promise? In 1992 there was no increase. In 1993 taxes went up by three per cent. In 1994 they went up by 10 per cent. In 1995 they went up by 12.2 per cent. What a promise. The greatest promiser of all times the most promising Prime Minister of Australia.

        The fact is that Paul Keating promised so much that, when the Labor Party went to sell him at functions, nobody would take him up. You wanted to sell him for $20,000 a night to anybody who would take him for a function, but he had made so many promises at that point that you did not get any takers to buy him. He is the most easily acquired Prime Minister this country has seen.

        What about excise and the commitment related to that? I will come to excise and indirect taxes, because one of the delights I have is looking at what the Labor Party did with excise and indirect taxes on petroleum. When Labor came to power in 1983, there was a 6.1 per cent per litre excise on petrol. At the beginning of 1996, the excise component of petrol represented almost 36.5c a litre. That is a jump since you guys in the Labor Party came into office from 6c a litre to 36c a litre—that was in 13 years. What a rip-off. Those are the promises you made—`We won't increase taxes'—but look at that amount. It is a sixfold increase on the grab out of the motorists' pocket.

They set in place a scheme where they gave a five per cent tax advantage on superannuation to low income earners and a 35 per cent advantage to high income earners.

When the Treasurer waltzed in on that occasion to show the state leaders who the boss was by dumping on them the proposal to abolish the sales tax exemptions, the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, led other premiers in making it very clear—if I can use canine parlance—that Mr Costello was barking up the wrong tree and that, if it was his idea to foster a close working relationship with the states, the Treasurer ought to be brought to heel on that initiative.

        The states, as I have mentioned, will have to bear a fairly overwhelming legacy of the Treasurer's fiasco at that June Premiers Conference through the loss of more than $1.5 billion in payments to states through the allocation of financial assistance grants over the next three years. That will no doubt be a legacy that will impact very heavily on the lives and opportunities of ordinary Australians. There is no doubt that most states have had to consider introducing a range of new taxes to offset their own funding shortfall—the impost which was forced upon them by the government at that charade and shambles of a Premiers Conference.

        As well, cuts to specific purpose payments to the states will also impact most severely on the services most utilised by ordinary working men and women of Australia. I refer to the HACC scheme, the home and community care scheme, which provides programs for both the elderly and the disabled in our community by incorporating within its programs and services Meals on Wheels, the home maintenance program, community transport arrangements, and home help services. For a government to claim that it was elected on a platform of caring for the needy and the poor, the cut to the home and community care program is indeed another example of what is a very clear breach of an equally clear and explicit campaign promise.

        The process surrounding the last Premiers Conference was, to most people who observed the goings on, a complete and utter farce.

Amongst other things he gave the premier of Victoria an opportunity and a reason to get into the tax debate. I know there is a bit of animosity between the premier of Victoria and the Treasurer, and the premier of Victoria was not too slow to arrive at the conclusion that if it is good enough for the Treasurer to propose treating the states in that particular way it is good enough for him to get involved in the debate on tax reform and the adoption of a value added tax of some sort or another. So it is no surprise that the Premiers, led by Mr Kennett, got stuck into the Treasurer's plan.

Unfortunately, the end result was that the states have yet again been forced to come to the federal government's fiscal rescue. Every year—under Labor it was never more evident—we have witnessed the Commonwealth squeeze the states even further.

        The revenue raising and revenue sharing arrangements of the states and Commonwealth do need to be reviewed as does, most importantly, the allocation of responsibilities. At the time of the drafting of the constitution, the states agreed to a division of the powers between the Commonwealth and the states. Some powers were to be the exclusive preserve of the Commonwealth, some were to be concurrent, and the residual powers were to be the preserve of the states. The so-called federal compact to which the states originally agreed was a very different arrangement to that which now prevails. There has been no significant change in the constitution itself to warrant that, so we have to look in other places for the reasons.

        Change over almost 100 years is certainly inevitable, but the continuing march of the Commonwealth to increase its powers at the expense of the states has been relentless—more relentless, I might add, over the past 13 or so years. At various stages in our national history the pursuit of increased powers by the Commonwealth has been a deliberate policy objective. The Commonwealth's grab for a uniform income tax system during the Second World War, using the wartime powers of the constitution, was a sensible decision in a time of war, but it laid the foundations of the current vertical fiscal imbalance that we witness in Australia today.

        The negative impact of the reduction in Commonwealth payments to the states cannot be overemphasised. Since 1982-83, Commonwealth own purpose outlays have increased by 35.5 per cent in real terms, compared with a reduction of 1.7 per cent for the Commonwealth payments to the states. Until 1989-90, the effect of this financial squeeze on state budgets was cushioned by revenue growth resulting from the one-off speculative boom in asset prices. Only since this speculative bubble has burst has the underlying financial position of the states been exposed.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was back in 1992 and not much has changed since then. Increases in federal own purpose outlays reveal the budget surpluses of the mid-1980s for what they actually were. They were not the result of the then Labor government's cutting back its own outlays, but were the outcome of a fiscally lax administration that passed on all cuts in Commonwealth government expenditure to the states by reduced grants. That was the main reason they were able to get into surplus. The states paid for the budget surpluses of the 1980s, of which Labor was so proud for such a short time, and redemption of debt by the states was thereby delayed. Now the coalition appears to be adopting the same or a very similar approach to that of Labor.

        It is easier for the Commonwealth to cut grants to the states rather than to reduce the amount of its own outlays—it is much easier. This passes the problem for cutting net government outlays onto the states. The states thereby have to cut their outlays to meet the falling level of federal grants or raise taxes and charges. Of course the states have the

         Whatever the answer, it is not desirable for the states to try to bridge the gap between current receipts and outlays only by increasing the taxes now available to them. The current tax bases of the states are too narrow and inelastic and will not grow as rapidly as the economy grows. They will lag behind growth in the economy as a general rule. State taxes are also highly concentrated on business inputs which distort business decision making and competitiveness.

The Treasurer, though, and his government cannot and should not continue to look to the states to provide their expenditure cuts. That has happened all too frequently in the immediate past.

        This bill, like the Costello budget, reflects a litany, an absolute multitude, of broken tax promises and betrayals in the eyes of Australian taxpayers. It is interesting to listen to government members talking today about the way in which the budget has been received in their electorates. It is interesting indeed to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) talking about the so&amp;hyphen;called family tax package. It is interesting indeed to compare that rhetoric and the reception the budget will really receive.

        Budget Paper No. 1 at 4&amp;hyphen;28 shows that on income tax this government and this Costello budget will collect $5&amp;half; billion additional tax compared to the last budget of the Keating government. That is a 9.1 per cent increase. Where is the family tax relief in an additional $5&amp;half; billion collection of income tax? Where is the family tax relief for a 9.1 per cent increase in income tax revenue collection? The truth is that, for every $100 the taxpayers paid in their tax to the Keating government, they will be paying $109.10 to the Howard government.

         What the government has shown and what this bill reflects is that this is a government much more of taxes than axes—a lot of axing but a lot more taxing. The Treasurer has shown he is much more a taxer than an axer. We do not oppose the provisions in this legislation, but we do oppose dishonesty in public life. We do not oppose the provisions in this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), but we oppose a Prime Minister who could not lie straight in bed. We do not oppose these provisions but we do oppose the breaking of scores of promises made to Australian taxpayers.

         The amendment reflects the government's failure to reduce the uplift factor on provisional tax for more than one year, for more than 1996&amp;hyphen;97 alone. It is surprising indeed that the government is not reflecting in its budget estimates the legislation of the parliament, because we had a lengthy debate just a few months ago about the uplift factor on provisional tax. This House, through Labor Party amendments in the Senate and here, introduced the formula by which, for the out years, provisional tax could be estimated.

         We see on page 1&amp;hyphen;19 of Budget Statement No. 1, regarding the major revenue measures, that the uplift factor on provisional tax is $180 million revenue forgone in 1996&amp;hyphen;97. But for the out years, 1997&amp;hyphen;98 and beyond, there is nothing but a dash in the budget papers. That reflects a broken tax promise, because this was a government that said, with regard to the uplift factor on provisional tax, that it would go down to six per cent; not six per cent for one year only, but six per cent across the term of the parliament. It was a promise of six per cent full stop, not a promise of six per cent qualified, for one year only. Yet we find in the budget papers that the funding for the uplift factor is for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 alone—$180 million. That is an outright betrayal of the government's tax promise.

           You promised smaller government. You have got tax collections going up by 0.4 per cent of GDP in your first budget. Then they go up and up; and, on the projections, they stay there.

           Earlier today, the Prime Minister in question time was waving around a few newspaper headlines. The truth is that, when it comes to taxation matters, there is only one headline that matters, and that is `Up Up Up'. Tax is going up for income; tax is going up for the Medicare levy; tax is going up on superannuation; tax is going up on the sales tax regime—tax is going up across&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;board. That is the lasting message of John Howard's performance on tax—up, up, up; betrayal, betrayal, betrayal.

All those government members who wander through their electorates saying that there is family tax relief will understand, and their constituents will understand, that that is not the case. That is not the case when income tax is rising so savagely, when tax promises are being broken hand over fist.

I refer them to just one page in Budget Statement No. 1, page 1-19. They should have a look at the major revenue measures of this government, at the things they promised before the election and what they have delivered on the major revenue collections of the Commonwealth.

           Some other important issues need to be raised in debate. They concern some of the detail of this legislation. The government promised before the election to increase the exemption amount on FBT to $100 for small items. That is a measure, a promise, that thankfully the government is keeping—one of the few on taxation measures. It is an initiative that the Parliamentary Labor Party is pleased to support. But our job on these things is, as you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, to keep them extra honest. A government that takes so trivially its own mandate needs to be kept honest.

           It is fair indeed to see that exemption on FBT indexed. If $100 is the appropriate amount in 1996-97, why should it not be indexed against movements in inflation? If $100 is good for 1996-97, then the $100 plus CPI is good for 1997-98 and beyond, financial year after financial year. If this government is serious about its rhetoric for small business it will support that amendment. It is a positive initiative of the Labor Party to say if the exemption on FBT is to be applied then let us apply it year after year, indexation period after indexation period.

There is nothing in here that talks about revenue forgone to the Commonwealth, nothing in Budget Statement No. 1 that identifies any revenue forgone. So maybe this is only a minor matter. The government certainly cannot argue that the Labor Party is being fiscally irresponsible if it cannot quantify in its own budget the amount of revenue that we are talking about.

         —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). Amendments to taxation bills are very commonplace in this chamber. Bills which makes things better, simpler, fairer and less complicated for individuals, families and business of all sizes, particularly small businesses, must be supported. As I travel around the electorate of Petrie and speak to many small business people, I find that compliance costs, fringe benefits tax and taxation are areas of great debate and interest. Many complain of a somewhat complicated system, the Australian taxation system, and wish that it would be a lot simpler. However, when I speak to those who want to make a go of it out there in the community, I believe that this government is taking the right direction and certainly will continue to do so in favour of business.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As has been discussed, the bill amends many areas which have become fundamental parts of business—commercial debt and the extended use of tax file numbers for superannuation purposes to further streamline superannuation administration. The bill also examines offshore banking units. Labor has for many years managed to sink small business into a sea of red tape and paperwork. In the bill the repeal section 261 will simplify loan documentation for the banking industry. More particularly, the area which I wish to address, schedule 5 amendments of the Fringe Tax Amendment Act 1986, paragraph 58P, deals specifically with fringe benefits tax exemption for small benefits.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The key points of the fringe benefits tax adjustment need to be noted and understood. The bill will in effect double the FBT minor benefits exemption. The amendments will allow for fringe benefits of less than $100 to qualify for exemption under FBT as long as they meet the conditions as set aside and as mentioned and relate to compliance costs. The amendment will also ensure that employers who provide irregular minor benefits of less
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         than $100 will avoid paying FBT all together. Now employers can assist further in ensuring the spirit and harmony of the workplace by acknowledging special achievements such as long-term value, productivity and contribution.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill before the House is another instalment in the government's ongoing strategy to streamline the operation of the taxation system with strong focus on providing small business with a less onerous regime and will enable incentives to invest and grow. It is true to say that FBT exemption to $100 will ensure that the compliance burden of this tax will ease on small business. Small business is the prime generator of jobs in the economy. It is a very important sector for the people of Petrie and for their community spirit and expectations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under the previous government we had a system that was all mixed up and that had the wrong elements. FBT was a system that was costly to administer, time consuming and costly to comply with. I had the privilege of coming to Canberra some years ago when the government introduced a fringe benefits tax to the restaurant industry. It devastated that industry. Nowhere in the world does one have to calculate fringe benefits tax on entertainment in such a complicated way as we do in Australia. One gets a headache just working out the fringe benefits component of a meal where clients are taken to lunch. It is one of the things we have to thank the previous government for.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This amendment has left small businesses battling for very long hours with pen, paper, calculator and a bundle of forms just to provide some benefit to employees and to keep their heads above water. When it comes to small business, time is money, and more time sweating on paperwork can mean lost opportunities out there in the marketplace. The costs of the FBT have been disproportionate to the value of the goods and services provided and the revenue flow to the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the most important measures of the new government has been the small business deregulation task force. Lynda Dean, a small businesswoman who is a very valued member
        <break page="3439" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         of that group, has described the fringe benefits tax as an `absolute nightmare of complexity' where, at times, the cost of compliance far outweighs the amount of tax to be paid.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Most importantly, these changes are part of the government's platform. Small businesses for so long struggled under the pressures and burdens placed on them by the previous government, and now the Howard government's initiatives are giving them a second chance. They are being given a second chance to make their businesses viable, to employ people and to provide quality, competition and cost-effectiveness to our economy.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This government is in its first six months, and it has already made some substantial inroads into providing avenues of sustainable management and opportunity—something that the previous government could not achieve with such complicated business measures. Furthermore, this government, through the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, will pursue the issue of aligning the FBT and income tax years. That is a very rational and commonsense option and one that the government is prepared to review and propose.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Small Business Deregulation Task Force was established by the government to examine compliance costs and the impacts on small business of government regulations and statistical requirements. It has been known in some instances for compliance costs for some taxes to be as high as 10 per cent of the total revenue collected. This government wishes to rectify this situation, and it is at last placing the pieces into place. The work of the deregulation task force is yet another election commitment enforced and a key plank in getting businesses working again.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government is looking forward to the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force—which is due on 1 November 1996—for its recommendations on revenue neutral measures which will ease the paperwork and compliance on small businesses. The task force is consulting widely in the community at the moment, and I expect they will deliver some very sound recommendations for a more equitable and cost-effective tax regime. As part of the government's
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         policy initiatives before the election, we also highlighted simplifying the rules in relation to entertainment and parking, and this will certainly come under the jurisdiction of the task force.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has also established a micro business consulting group which will network and advise the government on the specific policy requirements of this very important section of the small business community. These moves will take the pressure off small businesses—businesses which are still reeling from the gut wrenching interest rate rises throughout the early 1990s under the previous Labor government. The people of Petrie and the businesses of Petrie deserve to have some optimism put back into their lives.

        As I sat in the chamber today, I was quite astounded at some of the comments made by the opposition, particularly by the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) when he referred to the `peaceful demonstration' that occurred two days ago at Parliament House. I must be living in another country. If that was a peaceful demonstration, what does Bosnia look like? It was absolutely amazing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Isaacs also spoke about economic reform and how the Labor government was much better at economic reform. Where is this economic reform that he spoke of so freely? It certainly was not administered in the previous government. Also we had the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) talking about broken promises. He sounded very much like a broken record himself.

        The bill gives effect to a coalition election promise concerning the fringe benefits tax. It also deals with some outstanding legislative matters from the previous parliament which need to be addressed to relieve uncertainty in the business and taxpaying community. The bill deals with several matters, including forgiveness of commercial debt, extended use of tax file numbers for superannuation purposes, an exemption in the fringe benefits tax for minor benefits with a value less than $100, offshore banking units, the repeal of section 261 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, pooled superannuation trusts and deductions for gifts.

         concessional tax regime and exempts from interest withholding tax gold fees paid by OBUs as part of gold borrowings.

These concessions have the effect that the income derived by an OBU from OB activities is taxed at an effective rate of 10 per cent. These tax concessions are designed to facilitate the growth of Australia as a viable offshore banking centre, and thus the development of Australia as a significant international financial centre. These amendments relating to OBUs are beneficial to the operation of OBUs and will actually result in a minimal cost to the revenue.

        Section 261 operates to make void any covenant or stipulation in a mortgage which has or purports to have the purpose or effect of imposing on a mortgagor the obligation of paying income tax on the interest to be paid under that mortgage. Some offshore loan agreements provided for the complete protection of lenders against withholding tax and other taxes which affect the return to the lender. Typically, gross&amp;hyphen;up clauses are included in such agreements which provide that, if taxes are required to be deducted, the borrower is obliged to pay additional amounts so that the lender receives the full amount due to it.

        Section 261 has had the unintended consequence of applying to make void typical gross&amp;hyphen;up clauses in offshore loan agreements. Therefore, it needed to be repealed. Like the

        Singapore is considered to be Australia's largest competitor in that regard. However, Australia is starting behind the eight ball, as it were, because several factors are against us. Singapore has a more competitive tax regime. For example, dividends paid to residents from OBU activities are tax free. Singapore is better located in terms of its time zone—unless you are from Western Australia, of course, as I am—so it is better able to facilitate a 24&amp;hyphen;hour market by conducting business when the Hong Kong and Tokyo markets have just closed and the London market has not yet opened.

        As usual, Australia moved too slowly in the 1980s, which happens to coincide with the term of the previous Labor government, in freeing up the operating environment of offshore financial activities. In the early 1980s, Labor deregulated the financial markets—and most of us supported that—yet did not have the foresight to place Australia in a competitive position to promote Australia as a major financial centre for the Asia-Pacific region. We are labouring, if you will excuse the pun, as a result of that. Labor acted too slowly and only realised its mistake in the last few years with measures such as those in the One Nation and Innovation statements that it issued without very great effect, I am sorry to say. By this stage the competition had already left us miles behind.

        Part 1 of schedule 2 deals with the forgiveness of commercial debt, and I might say more about that in the detail stage. This matter was originally covered in Labor's Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1995, which lapsed on the dissolution of the last parliament. The present law contains no specific rules relating to debt forgiveness,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         thereby creditors are entitled to a tax deduction or capital loss for the amount of debt forgiven and debtors have no tax consequences. These amendments will not treat the debt&amp;hyphen;forgiven debt as a taxable gain, but will apply the forgiven amount in the reduction of certain amounts otherwise taken into account in calculating the debtor's taxable income.

        Another measure in this bill which has come from the Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1995 is schedule 4, which deals with the use of tax file numbers—another acronym: TFNs—by superannuation funds. These provisions are aimed at streamlining and reducing the costs of the administration of superannuation generally and funds in particular. Super funds will have the authority to ask all their members who have not provided their tax file number to do so. However, there is no obligation under these proposals on the members to provide TFNs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reason the super funds want their members to provide TFNs is that there are many super accounts over which the funds cannot locate the beneficiary. That is part of the legacy of Labor's slothful approach to superannuation funds. Even the multiplicity of amendments never quite came to terms with that and many other problems with its compulsory superannuation scheme or schemes.

        Schedule 5 deals with a pre-election promise made by the coalition to ensure that fringe benefits with a value less than $100 can qualify for the exemption from fringe benefits tax for minor benefits. In the detail stage, I shall be moving an amendment in that connection.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The current situation is that the Taxation Office has issued an advice that a benefit of less than $50 only qualifies for this exemption. The coalition promised the measure now proposed in its small business policy at the last election, and, as far as it goes, it is entirely supportable. The reason the coalition targeted the FBT for reform is that the cost of compliance is out of control by any measure.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have made the point, Mr Deputy Speaker, in this place on many occasions—I suspect that you have had to suffer me doing that; and you do not have to nod agreeably!—that the fringe benefits tax needs radical reform so
        <break page="3442" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         that it is simplified and so that the cost of complying with the law is reduced, not abstractly but simply to reasonable levels.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This, no doubt, should include a complete review of the FBT so that it is restricted to doing what it was first intended to achieve and what, by any reasonable analysis, a taxpayer, an employer and an employee would expect of it—that is, to reduce the provision of non-cash remuneration to employees so as to limit the incidence of tax avoidance. No-one has argued with that, but, of course, it has gone much further.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Doubling the FBT minor benefits exemption goes some way, if only as a signal that it is crazy at the level that it is now at, to achieving this. However, it does not go nearly far enough. Even my proposed amendment does not go nearly far enough, in my opinion, but it is far more sensible than that which the government now envisages.

        It is for this reason that I will be moving an amendment in the consideration in detail stage to increase this amount to a miserable $200. If it was good enough for the committee to say it and if it is good enough for almost everyone in this chamber to be nodding in agreement at the moment, then it is good enough for that amendment to receive not only careful consideration but also the blessing of the government.

        The government's election promise on the provisional tax uplift factor, to reduce the rate from eight per cent to six per cent, was arbitrary. I do not think they deny that. It had no justification in logic. It paid no attention to projected growth, income growth and the consumer price index. The setting of the minor benefits threshold that I am suggesting is just another example of an arbitrary figure with no means of justification—it is just something plucked out of the air—so my figure is no better or no worse in that sense than that of the government except that mine is more generous and, I submit, far more sensible.

        I have noticed with great interest the use of compliance cost impact statements in the explanatory memorandums. This was something trumpeted by the previous government. They and the present government—so far; admittedly it has had only a short time—have a long way to go in that regard. These statements were introduced by Labor and are supposed to give a good indication of the cost of complying with a new tax measure. If you look at the statements for the measures contained in this bill, you will see that they fall a long way short of providing a useful guide to the changed cost of compliance. No dollar amounts are mentioned. Why would you have in the explanatory memorandum a cost of compliance proposal and no dollar amounts mentioned? I know why—because you do not know the answer.

        Of course, it is difficult to quantify the cost for compliance for individual businesses because of the different sizes of firms, the nature of their businesses and every other variable you could think of; however, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is able to estimate the cost or gain to the revenue, so they should be able to estimate the compliance cost to the economy. If they cannot, they should learn how to very quickly. From this figure they can work out the compliance costs of the average firm. It is one thing to explain how each new provision will impact on compliance costs, but it is largely a waste of time under present circumstances.

         As members of this House will be aware, Cyprus was invaded by Turkey in 1974. There were tens of thousands of refugees dispersed from the northern part of the country by the invading Turkish troops. A number of people disappeared and have not been seen since. The island was divided between the occupied Turkish north of the country and the Republic of Cyprus in the south of the country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia—previous Liberal governments, the previous Labor government and the current Liberal government—has recognised the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus and the government of the Republic of Cyprus is recognised by Australia as having sovereignty over the whole island. What people have tried to do over the years is draw the attention of the international community to this very tragic circumstance. That has been done in a number of ways, both in this parliament, by people in international forums, and particularly by the Greek Cypriot community, both here in Australia and around the world.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the ways looked at in August this year to raise people's consciousness of the Cyprus issue was to have a motorcycle cavalcade from Berlin through Europe, arriving in the occupied city of Kyrenia in Cyprus. That was to be a peaceful drive. There were to be some hundreds of people involved and it was to highlight the Cyprus problem throughout Europe. Unfortunately, the Turkish invaders planned a massive counterdemonstration. They brought in reinforcements from Turkey and there were a number of extremists who have been involved in a terrorist organisation called the Grey Wolves, who were imported by the Turkish invaders, to counter this peaceful demonstration.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The aim of the Turkish organisation was to create havoc and give the impression that Turkish and Greek Cypriots could not live together on the island. The problem with that would have been that it would have created this international view that you have violence in Cyprus, you have Turkish Cypriots pitted against Greek Cypriots and the Turkish invaders and the Turkish government would
         <break page="3444" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          have been able to say, `That is the reason we should be there.'

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfortunately, what one would have hoped might not have occurred did occur. The Greek Cypriots were at a peaceful demonstration in the zone between the Turkish occupied part of the country and the republic occupied part of the country. In that area on 11 August there was a peaceful demonstration by Greek Cypriots and the response by the Turks was that 40 people were injured and one young man Anastasios Isaak, a 24-year-old Greek Cypriot, was killed. He was beaten and clubbed to death by people in front of the world media. These are the people who say that Turkey should be admitted to the European Union.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To make matters worse, a few days later on 14 August in a funeral procession for this young man there was once again an incident where another young man, 26-year-old Solomos Solomov, was shot by Turkish troops. A number of peacekeepers were shot by Turkish troops, and a number of other people who were at a demonstration were shot by Turkish troops.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This is an outrageous arrangement and the unfortunate thing is that when the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) condemned this issue he tried to say that this was an intercommunal problem, and it is not. The problem with Cyprus is that the Greek Cypriots are responding to an invader. The Turkish invasion of Cyprus is an international issue; it is not an intercommunal issue in Cyprus.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Turkish Cypriots have voted with their feet. If the Turkish army was there to protect them, why then have 24 per cent of the Turkish Cypriot community in Cyprus left the island? They don't even feel safe with the Turks who said that they came there to protect them. Indeed, there have been a number of Turkish Australians who have expressed that fear this week.

I refer to Tassos Isaak, a 24-year-old man whose wife is pregnant with their first child and was savagely beaten to death, and Solomos Solomov, who was shot dead in cold blood by the Turkish military. The United Nations, in a statement dated 14 August 1996, strongly condemned the killings and, in the words of the UN Secretary&amp;hyphen;General, `the indiscriminate use of force which has caused two men to be killed and many more to be injured, including UN peacekeepers'.

        The frustration which must have been felt by these two young men is indicative of the frustrations felt by all who have watched the island of Cyprus invaded by the Turkish government and it demonstrates the horrific costs that the continued division of Cyprus is inflicting on both the Greeks and the Turkish communities of Cyprus.

They were present in the gallery when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) delivered the budget speech last night and I am very pleased to say that they are here in the gallery tonight. I have great pleasure in presenting their responses, as young people, to the budget. In their own words, they say:

        Most of last night's Budget, if not all, directly effects young people in Australia. The Budget shows new initiatives and new ideas for our nation. Even though these will not be agreed to by certain interest groups at least they show courage to try new things and move this country into the twenty first century.

        The traineeship initiative is exactly what many young people need to get them into the workforce. In last nights Budget the Government announced that it is going to provide almost $207 million to employers who take on apprentices. Not only does this aid young people who will obtain apprenticeships, but it will also boost the business community and the economy in turn.

        The most important and exciting aspect of my trip to Canberra has not been the trip itself, nor is it having dinner in the dining hall with the people who are in charge of running my nation. It is the fact that I have been able to express my views on Australian Society and tell you, my government, what direction I believe this country should proceed in.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I believe that the Australian Government has to continue to ask young Australians their opinions on key issues so that they know their voice is being heard. Many young people feel alienated from the political process, partly due to a lack of knowledge of the functions of their Government, but mainly because they do not realise that politicians are there to represent them. The Australian Government must recognise that although they have been given their mandate to govern by the voting population of Australia, they also have a responsibility to represent the great number of Australians who are not yet of voting age, and I believe that Mr. Costello's budget succeeded in terms of this challenge and I was pleased to hear his concerns for the young people in Question Time today.

        If there is hope in the foreseeable future most young people won't feel the need to turn to drugs or rebel against their society. Most, if not all young Australians, would be grateful for employment, no matter what the sceptics may say, and I believe that initiatives like the Green Corps are a start on the road to re&amp;hyphen;motivating the young people in this country. Australia's youth will act in a more responsible fashion only when they see clear acknowledgment of their perspective's through Federal Government Policy, and the opportunity that I have been given has allowed me to see this and to gain a better understanding of my government and country.

         —I rise tonight because, like the previous speaker, the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), I too have received a couple of letters in the last couple of days. One was a very urgent letter faxed from the Fairfield City Council which, I will place on record now, is not a Labor controlled council. It came directly from the office of the mayor, who had expressed serious concern on behalf of the Fairfield City Council on a number of issues which were going to be undertaken in cuts in the budget. Of course, after the disastrous budget last night, we now know what they had read about and heard about and how it was going to affect their particular community, which is my city. This is the first opportunity I have had to express their concerns.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The mayor has gone on about how upset they are and how the Fairfield city will be adversely affected by the cuts. They talked about the labour market programs—bearing in mind that the unemployment level of Fairfield city is approximately twice the national average, which is currently at 19 per cent. The letter then went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Council has been notified by the National Family Day Care Centre and Community Child Care that changes will be made to operational funding of Children Services.
       </para>
       <para>
        We now know that is a fact. The council is very concerned that any cuts that take place would affect English as a second language services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The home and community care program, which has helped so many aged in our community, is almost going to user pays. They then mention the youth activities service, which is a fully funded program providing recreational and educational programs for disadvantaged young people aged between 11
        <break page="3448" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         and 16. These activities are held on a regular basis throughout Fairfield city. They say they are concerned because there have been rumours that this program will be axed. We now know that is a fact.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have certainly voiced my concern and I will do it again, because the council raised the urban flood mitigation program and what the cessation of money coming from the federal government is going to mean to an area like Fairfield city. They have been involved in this program from the very onset in a 2 to 1 relationship as far as the funding program goes. Clearly, with the federal government pulling out of this, it will now mean that all mitigation works that had been undertaken—or were planed to be undertaken in the future—instead of now taking 15 years to complete, may go on the never-never plan. It is estimated that something like $33 million worth of work is yet to be done.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They are concerned about the Commonwealth-state housing agreement; the better cities program; the regional development; and the foreshadowed, as it was then, reduction in the resources of the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. We now know, after the budget, that we haven't got to worry about the reduction in it, because we just will not have a Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They are very concerned about the cuts to the University of Western Sydney. Fairfield City Council—which, I reiterate, is a Liberal controlled council; there is an independent mayor there at the moment—has stated:

         Of course, that was followed up by a copy of another letter that has just been sent to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) from the Fairfield Community Resource Centre. It is marvellous when you realise that these community groups are now all coming out expressing their disquiet and concern because of what has come out in the budget. They are certainly expressing their concern, as a community resource centre that works particularly with non-English speaking people, about the employment orientated programs conducted through our community in Fairfield, about what it has been able to do for the community through skillshare, the AMES and the new enterprise incentive schemes, and about how now these schemes are going to be affected because of what the budget has spelt out very clearly to the people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That community resource centre has also asked me to raise the cuts to the migration program and how they are being reported from all levels within the community: the reduction of the humanitarian program, the introduction of the extra points for the English language proficiency, and the restriction of sponsorship ability under the preferential family for Australian citizens only.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They said that another area of grave concern to them as a community relates to the proposed industrial relations bill being considered by the parliament. Of course, we know where that is and we know what is happening there in the Senate. It will give me great satisfaction to write back to them and say that possibly the government of the day may have bought off a particular senator up there and may have, as part of a deal, tried to get an extra vote in that way. We do not know, but we just hope commonsense does prevail.

         —I want to impress upon the House this evening the importance of establishing the Natural Heritage Trust Fund. The current budget, which was so ably introduced last night by my colleague the Treasurer, Peter Costello, is a fair and reasonable budget. It gave an undertaking that $158 million would be spent over four years for the environment related initiatives, on top of the planned Natural Heritage Trust. I can assure honourable members that that money was extremely well received in my electorate. The allocation for this year's budget was $30 million. I received a very welcome announcement in my electorate, which is part of the Murray-Darling catchment basin. The money, which was quite substantial, was introduced into a number of areas. The importance of the Natural Heritage Trust, with an input of $1 billion into the revival of our environment in Australia, can never be underestimated.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The legislation is over in another place at the moment. It is dependent upon the sale of one-third of the shares in Telstra. It is interesting to note that the claim that we made prior to the election, that the former government had done a deal with the sale of the information technology group out of Telstra to IBM&amp;hyphen;Lend Lease and that that was a fait accompli before the election, was proven to be the case. The very heart of the Telstra organisation—the information technology group—was all wrapped up and signed, sealed and delivered before the election. The government kept that under wraps. It is important that the sale and the public subscription to one-third of the shares in Telstra go ahead to enable us to push forward with the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust.

        I implore members of both sides of the parliament to support the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust. It is extremely important for rural areas throughout Australia and also for the urban environment. My good friend at the table, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), also has some interest in this matter and would certainly be interested in the green corps, which will be involved not only in rural pursuits in the environment but also in urban pursuits. The honourable member had quite an amount of input into that scheme. I look forward to the implementation of that scheme because I can see some tremendous possibilities under that Natural Heritage Trust for the expenditure of money, which will be a capital investment in the environment of this country.

        There could be no better achievement for our young people—we have some of them in the gallery with us this evening—than to be able to participate in putting something back into a capital project in an environment based activity. We have already triggered a certain amount of money in this budget, but more money is required. We have all sorts of problems. The salinity impact in my area is of huge importance. We need to arrest the degradation of land and water quality. It is particularly important to the Bendigo electorate, and I am sure for many members in their own electorate, to do something about improving the environment for our young people and for the future of this country.

        We went to Halls Creek because we were keen to ascertain what really happened, not just what was reported. Events in a town which develop into a riot completely out of control are not new. There have been several incidents in recent years where the police have just been able to contain the situation and avoid the large&amp;hyphen;scale publicity that ensues.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The worrying thing is that the recent riots involved young people. Our investigation shows that there was no element of payback, as reported in the media. A review of the charge sheet shows that the participants came overwhelmingly from desert communities. The disturbance did not start in the pub. The police did not trigger the event by arresting anyone in the pub. The publican's staff say that the crowd had been drinking before the pub opened at 4 p.m. It appears that they had had access to fortified wine that may have come from the bottle shop. It is also clear that there was no participation in the riot by local Aboriginal people.

        Policing is difficult in country areas where there are large numbers of Aboriginal people and particularly where there are people living in outlying communities in considerable numbers. By and large, the police do a good job and provide a visible service that goes far beyond law and order issues. Their dedication is even more remarkable when the widespread demoralised state of the force is considered. A large part of the problem is caused by the actions of a few overzealous senior officers, who have now left, particularly ex&amp;hyphen;Deputy Commissioner Les Ayton.

        Policing areas such as Halls Creek, Fitzroy Crossing, Leonora, Laverton, Carnarvon and Broome, et cetera is different as well as difficult and requires people with special training and attitude. These people are available and their skills and leadership should be cherished and nourished by the police force. Policing these areas, where there is a high component of Aboriginal people, is overwhelming community policing and it requires police to be able to get to know the people on an individual basis.

         The police are already providing services that should be provided by other government departments—ATSIC, health, education and welfare—and other agencies. The provision of a police presence in all major communities will improve all facets of service delivery for these agencies. It is quite clear that the police force cannot provide this necessary service out of its own budget. This should be recognised and addressed. Instead we see examples of waste and incompetence in these areas. ATSIC has decided to cut funding by 20 per cent over the next five years in remote areas and direct these savings to cities, largely Sydney and Melbourne. This is an inequitable decision and will compound problems in the bush and literally drive people out of the communities to impact mainly on country towns.

         —The opposition supports wholeheartedly the Australia Law Reform Commission Bill and the Australia Law Reform Commission (Repeal, Transitional and Miscellaneous) Bill. It is particularly pleasing for me to support these bills because, in the last parliament, I was the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which inquired into the Law Reform Commission of Australia.

        The current Attorney&amp;hyphen;General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) was also a member of that committee. It was obvious throughout the hearings that the Law Reform Commission had cross&amp;hyphen;party support. We undertook the first comprehensive review of the commission in its 20&amp;hyphen;year existence. It is really pleasing to note that our review showed that the Law Reform Commission was a dynamic organisation that was producing quality reports and was giving quality independent advice to government. It is essential in a democracy like ours that we have something like the Law Reform Commission.

        The previous government had picked up, as I understand it, most of the recommendations of my parliamentary committee. This current government has also done that. I think that is testimony to the cross&amp;hyphen;party support that the Law Reform Commission rightfully enjoys. The one sad aspect is that budget cuts will affect the operation of the Law Reform Commission because, in the document
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Meeting our commitments
        </emphasis>
        , the coalition admitted that cuts would affect the commission. They will result in a small reduction in the number of reports produced by the commission.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The commission's budget of $3.9 million per year will be cut by $0.5 million per year, or 12.8 per cent. That was announced during the election campaign and was administered in the budget yesterday. That is a small hiccup and I am sure that a dynamic organisation such as the Law Reform Commission will be able to make the necessary adjustments. What worries me in the current climate is that it is going to be very hard for some people to say, `No, this is not the way to go.' That is why we need an independent Law Reform Commission.

        I notice that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, in his usual courteous fashion, is here today, paying us the courtesy of listening to this debate. I appreciate that. I have said it a number of times—and I cannot say it enough—that, while I do not agree with everything that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is doing because obviously we do differ on a number of things—and I respect and understand that—I must say that he brings distinction to his position.

         The position of Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is one that, in a cabinet, needs to be a challenging position and one that is understood to be so. The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General cannot be a yes&amp;hyphen;man or a yes&amp;hyphen;woman. He or she is the first law officer of the Crown, who needs to take on the cabinet at times—and the cabinet needs to understand that. The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is there to provide proper advice in relation to the existing law.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General has really the same role and function as the Australian Law Reform Commission, which is there to keep us all honest and not to pander to prejudice in the community or to the lowest common denominator, nor to advise politically or in a partisan fashion. It is there to assist us as law&amp;hyphen;makers and to provide the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General with independent and proper advice. It is not there to have all its recommendations picked up, but it is part of the equation. It is part of the jigsaw, as is the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's office. The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General made an outstanding contribution in the last parliament to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is interesting that, on each occasion that he has had the opportunity in government, he has attempted to build on the recommendations and the views that he expressed when he was on the backbench.

         The downside is that we should not get carried away with all this backslapping and bipartisanship, because we need to continually be on our mettle. I am fearful that, in the current climate of the push for law and order, tougher sentencing and a whole range of so&amp;hyphen;called reforms in the legal and justice area, we are being driven by the lowest common denominator, the redneck radio commentators, the ill&amp;hyphen;informed and the prejudiced.

         In 10 years as a practising solicitor and barrister in New South Wales, I never had a case accurately or properly reported by the press. It was always sensationally reported. The Law Reform Commission and advisory bodies like that bring us, as politicians, back to heel a little. What we need are considered, informed debates and an independent, vibrant, Law Reform Commission to give us non&amp;hyphen;partisan, non&amp;hyphen;political advice. What we are about is good law.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Looking at the American way of doing things, I do not think that is the path to go down. That is why I wholeheartedly support what the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General has done, and so does the opposition as a whole. We are pleased to give our support to this bill. It is a bill about which we can say, `We laid the foundations for it, and the ball has been passed to this government and, in effect, they are running over and scoring the try.' That is the case. It has been basically a partnership in the implementation of this bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was not that way when we started our inquiry into the Law Reform Commission. It is fair to say that there was a view around that we could probably do without the Law Reform Commission and that it, in some areas, had not been up to scratch. There is no doubt that the dynamism of the people who have headed the Law Reform Commission has impacted on the sorts of reports that the commission has done, and that it has evolved. There is no doubt that occasionally its emphasis has not necessarily been endorsed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was interesting throughout our inquiry that there were a number of professionals within the legal profession and a number of people within the business community who were prepared to donate their time to assist in the compilation of reports and to provide professionalism to the reports that the Law Reform Commission was providing for this parliament and the nation. They were able to do that because of their sense of professionalism, and the high regard in which the Law Reform Commission is held. A parliamentary committee cannot do that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know there was a view around that maybe we could do away with the Law Reform Commission and set up a parliamentary committee that has those particular functions. I do
         <break page="3456" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          not agree with that. The less the politicians are involved in areas like this, the better, because what we do, in a number of instances, is that whilst we are well&amp;hyphen;meaning we do not have that experience, that professionalism, on the ground. We have changed; we may well have thought we were good lawyers before we entered parliament, but the truth is that you do lose that contact on the ground. That is something that the Law Reform Commission can do—as an independent, statutory body it can reach into a whole range of professional communities and produce quality reports.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Law reform: the challenge continues
         </emphasis>
         and I think the Law Reform Commission is taking up the challenge, especially in the current climate. This is particularly so because, as a centralist—and I do not apologise for that—I think it is absurd in a nation such as ours, as we are heading to the centenary of Federation, that we have six state jurisdictions and two territory jurisdictions so that, but for an accident of birth or depending on where you are in Australia, you are subject to different penalties and different rules apply. That is why with the Law Reform Commission, arising out of the reports and arising out of this bill, there is some flexibility. What we are looking for is a national approach to coordinate the states so that there is no division.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If you are a Queenslander, why should you be dealt with differently by the law than if you were born in New South Wales and dealt with in New South Wales? This is where the Law Reform Commission assists us because it is able to overarch, to reach into those state instrumentalities, to find agreement—and it is not easy—and bring down a proper perspective. So I commend the bill to the parliament. It has the wholehearted support of the opposition. Indeed, it is fair to say that our fingerprints are all over it—and proudly so. But so are the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is important to acknowledge that, in terms of the reference that the last parliament dealt with, it was the current Attorney&amp;hyphen;General who was the driving force behind the reference and was enthusiastic about our doing the reference. I know he is a supporter of the Law Reform Commission—as he should be because, on any proper analysis of what it has done over the last 20 years, it really does get the big tick. And what it again shows is that, in the Law Reform Commission, a lot of the people involved are committed to public service in the true professional sense.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It also shows that there are those in the private professions who are prepared to work with the Law Reform Commission and who, instead of charging the thousands and thousands of dollars they quite rightly can command in their own professions, donate many of their services for free, from a sense of public duty. We found that it was just token travel expenses that were being met. That is the benefit of the Law Reform Commission. It is part of the equation. It is part of that partnership that the parliament has with the community. So I commend the Attorney for picking up most of the recommendations in our report and carrying them through in the current climate.

         —I must say it is somewhat humbling to follow the member for Banks (Mr Melham) who was chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when the report which is the basis of this legislation was handed down. I also note that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams), who is in the chamber today and was a member of the committee at the same time, indicated in his second reading speech that he was pleased to be able to implement, in his role as Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, substantially the bulk
         <break page="3457" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of the recommendations of the committee which were contained in the report titled

       <para first-indent="16">
        The former Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, Michael Lavarch, indicated that the overriding principles, as he saw the government's role in terms of the legal system, were threefold. Firstly, all Australians should have equality before the law. Secondly, Australians, regardless of their place of residence, should have similar rights and privileges. Thirdly, Australians should have equal access to legal services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Clearly, if obtaining justice is prohibitive for ordinary Australians, the legal system becomes all but irrelevant to them. If our legal system does not remain both relevant and accessible, it will have repercussions for our legal system itself and, of course, for the principle of the rule of law, which we all cherish so dearly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is in that context that the role of the Law Reform Commission can be particularly worthwhile. It is my experience that the cost of access to the law is not only a result of the costs of the participants, the lawyers, the transcript fees and the filing fees, but also results in large part from legal complexities which can necessitate litigants requiring the services of those specialist lawyers. So any steps that can be taken to make the law more relevant and accessible and to simplify it will ultimately be of benefit to our legal system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I note that the thrust of these bills is not only to give the Australian Law Reform Commission a new title and to update and modernise the drafting of the former provisions, but also to affect three other significant areas. The legislation will require the Law Reform Commission, as it will be reconstituted, to consider proposals for complementary laws between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories; to have regard to such of Australia's international treaty obligations as are relevant; and to take into account the implications of its recommendations on lowering the cost of justice. It is those three issues which I would like to address today.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to speak firstly in terms of complementary laws, perhaps not only because it is topical but also because it is very relevant as part of the make&amp;hyphen;up of our society today, about the efficient functioning of our industrial relations system. If I can give one example of the complexities that exist, it is in respect of the provision which is proposed in the Workplace Relations Bill for the disamalgamation of trade unions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We exist, under the federal system, in a position where trade unions are usually registered under that federal system and also under state systems. Quite frequently, the trade unions which are registered under the state systems are, in effect, the same as the branches of the federal body. It is usually the case that the membership is duplicated. Yet, under those separate state systems, it is frequently the case that the legislation purports to give a separate corporate identity to that state union.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government is faced with a position and, indeed, the trade unions are faced with a position of trying to identify, literally, who is who in the zoo. With respect to the disamalgamation of trade unions, it will not only be a question of unscrambling the egg in terms of the division of assets and the division of members but also there will be the question of identifying which chicken the egg came from and then allocating the chicken to the appropriate jurisdiction, whether it be state or federal and whether that can be done at all.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If the amalgamation was the result of, say, a federation of those state registered trade unions, it may be that the federal legislation cannot have any impact on them at all. I do not wish to discuss the federal industrial relations legislation. I am merely pointing out that great
        <break page="3458" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         complications arise every day as a result of our federal system and hence the need to reform. It creates complexities in trade unions and it creates complexities for any enforcement agency trying to work out who is responsible for a particular conduct, or against which body some particular award or penalty could be enforced. Similarly, the same thing would apply to employer organisations which wanted to seek some redress. The inconvenience and dislocation apply across the board.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am not suggesting that the government has created that dislocation or uncertainty. The problems were first demonstrated in 1972 and it resulted in the Sweeney inquiry, as it was then known. But, regrettably, the federal and state legislatures have seen fit to do very little about it in that 24&amp;hyphen;year period. Hopefully, with this new and specific direction, the Law Reform Commission can roll up its sleeves and look at issues that permeate our everyday lives.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second area that the Law Reform Commission has an obligation to consider is Australia's international treaty obligations, as they are relevant to Australia. This is an increasingly important area. The significance of treaties has been underlined by the fact that the federal parliament has, as I recall, with bipartisan support, established the treaties committee—it is now the second largest joint standing committee—to look at international treaties before they are made and to review treaties that are already in force.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In more recent times, the High Court has referred to Australia's international treaty obligations in considering the development of the common law which, fortunately, continues to live, grow, adapt and mould itself according to society as we know it. We have now come to a situation where the High Court recognises that Australia is part of an international community and that what happens in that international community will affect the very fabric of our own society and the infrastructure of laws itself. That is, in my opinion, a highly desirable eventuality and trend. It is one which I believe will continue, largely irrespective of which government is in power.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Australia is a middle order power on the world stage, and we have two choices: we can participate in an international community where there is a developing and growing international rule of law, or we can return to the days of the 1950s, 1960s and into the 1970s, where we were substantially beholden to the respective calls made by the superpowers. It is in our interests, I would submit, that the influence of the five or six superpowers, as they are known, be tempered by a mutuality, established between all nations and existing and developing the international rule of law to which I have referred; and Australia can play a part in the development of such mutuality through negotiating, developing and reviewing treaties. This is an appropriate role, as I have indicated, in which the Law Reform Commission could look at not only what has happened domestically but also what has occurred through our attaching and linking ourselves to the international community and, indeed, to the international standards as set by international treaty documents.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third and final area which is highly significant is the obligation cast upon the Australian Law Reform Commission to have regard to the costs of justice. As I have earlier noted, the cost of justice is itself significant, in terms of the access that the ordinary Australian can have to the legal system—and not only the ordinary Australian but also the business community. I must say that, in my former employment as a solicitor, I was involved in one or two pieces of litigation on a personal basis; and, even though I had the resources of a legal firm supporting me, I spent a few hours awake during the night worrying about the possible consequences of the legal costs and, indeed, the all but disaster which would befall if the
        <break page="3459" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         litigation were lost. I can well imagine how much more accentuated those costs would be for an ordinary Australian who did not have such resources. When we have come to that situation in life, we clearly have to take stock and have a look at the lie of the land.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In that context, I note some concern that there is a trend to recoup, if you like, the cost of justice by the court registries themselves. That is something which applies in the states, and I note that there is presently a draft bill—which I will not discuss, because it is quite inappropriate here—to raise the filing fees of federal tribunals. I would ask all those involved, however, to recognise that there are not only up&amp;hyphen;front costs of litigation, in the sense of paying for lawyers, which is but one aspect of the legal costs, but also the costs of filing fees—which, in some instances in the Federal Court, may well increase to $1,600—to be added to the cost of transcripts, for instance, which currently would cost a litigant approximately $750 per day, in addition to what they are paying for the barristers and for the solicitors. Even where there is supposedly a cost free jurisdiction currently, such as under the Industrial Relations Act 1988, those hidden costs still apply. Each litigant still has to meet the costs of that $750 per day transcript.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All these hidden costs have to be factored into any equation when we are considering access to justice. Again it is entirely appropriate that the Law Reform Commission looks at those matters and other matters it may have regard to in terms of the cost of litigation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another significant area on which I would hope the Law Reform Commission would focus in its independent role is access to legal resource materials. In this parliament we are very fortunate indeed in the access we have through our computer network system to a wide range of resources through the Parliamentary Library, including access to High Court cases, state cases, legislation and the like. It has to be a fact that, if that resource base becomes more accessible throughout the community, the reduced cost of finding the law or researching the law will bring down the costs of law. So I hope that is one area to which the Law Reform Commission will consider it appropriate to give further consideration.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is one negative aspect. While I give due recognition to the support of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General for the Law Reform Commission which was commented on by the member for Banks in his speech before mine, I am concerned that, in the context of the complexities and the developments to which I have referred, the government has seen fit to reduce the funding available to the Law Reform Commission. That is something which I regret and, indeed, the Labor opposition regrets. We hope that, as this newly constituted—if you like—Law Reform Commission undertakes its task, the government may well reconsider the question of funding that body. I think it will be found that with its new charter the Law Reform Commission will become even more effective and deserving of support. I support the bills before the House.

         —I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your guidance. This particular bill largely implements the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and is yet another indication of the success of the House of Representatives committee system. The future of the Law Reform Commission was referred to this committee after the Law Reform Commission had been in existence for some 20 years. This is largely a housekeeping bill. After the Law Reform Commission has played a role for 20 years it is sensible to review the legislation; it is appropriate to review the functions of the Law Reform Commission. In effect, it is important to take a stocktake to ensure that the Australian taxpayer is receiving value for dollar.

        We had, I think, some 61 submissions, and we made 40 recommendations. The new Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams), having succeeded his Labor predecessor, has considered the recommendations of the committee and has brought forward this bill. The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, I believe, is very well qualified to consider matters in the area of law reform, having been the chairman of the Law Reform Commission of Western Australia when he was in private practice in that state.

        The bill does a number of things. It formally changes the name of the commission to the Australian Law Reform Commission. It requires the commission to consider proposals for complementary laws between the Commonwealth and the states and territories, to have regard for such of Australia's international treaty obligations as are relevant, and to take into account the implications of its recommendations on lowering the cost of justice.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill also enables the commission to appoint consultants, it clarifies the role of the deputy president and provides for the appointment of an acting president in the president's absence or when the office of president is vacant. It also provides for the establishment of a board of management comprising the president, deputy president and full&amp;hyphen;time members. It confers chief executive officer powers on the president or the president's delegate and confers appropriate powers on the full commission or a delegate of the full commission.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Most importantly, the bill also provides members and staff with immunity from civil action, the cause of which necessarily or reasonably arises in the course of duties being honestly undertaken before the commission. In these days of financial stringency, no doubt it is a very
        <break page="3461" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         great relief to see that there will be no additional financial obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by these bills.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I found the evidence before the committee to be very thought provoking. The committee was able to attract a large number of submissions from a very broad range of people involved in the law reform community throughout Australia. One of the things the committee did was to review the situation in individual states and it was quite interesting to see that the law reform process is approached quite differently in different parts of Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I agreed substantially with the results of the deliberations of the committee; however, in the report I registered an expression of concern in relation to a number of areas. I did not elevate the expression of concern, to the chairman's relief, to that of a dissenting report, but I was concerned particularly about three issues. I was convinced by the arguments of the Premier of Western Australia that the Law Reform Commission ought to, in fact, be referred to as the Commonwealth Law Reform Commission because that would indicate a clear demarcation of the work undertaken by the commission. I took the view, and mentioned in the report, that the designation `Commonwealth Law Reform Commission' would be a more appropriate manner in which to describe the Commonwealth body responsible for federal law reform.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Some people would say that the Australian Law Reform Commission has a facilitating role in relation to law reform beyond the area of Commonwealth responsibility and that it has liaised quite successfully with state bodies and, I believe, bodies across the Tasman with a view to attaining, to the greatest degree possible, uniformity of law. It is obvious that the new government has accepted the recommendation of the committee that the name be changed from the Law Reform Commission of Australia to the Australian Law Reform Commission.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I had, however, a more major concern in relation to the preparation of draft legislation accompanying the reports of the Law Reform Commission. The former chairman, who is sitting opposite, would well remember my views on this matter. I recall that, on many occasions, the Law Reform Commission would bring down reports which would be sent to the Attorney and government of the day for consideration. The government would take a considerable amount of time to decide what its response was going to be.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Rarely would the government agree to implement the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in full. The draft legislation, which was prepared by the Law Reform Commission, would often languish and be unused. Even if the government accepted partially the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission, by the time it came forward with a response the draft legislation, prepared at great cost to the Australian taxpayer, was entirely out of date. In fact, there was some evidence before the committee that the preparation of draft legislation was a delaying factor in the production of reports of the Law Reform Commission. I remain very concerned about this matter.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important for the government to consider reports of the Law Reform Commission as expeditiously as possible. I have no doubt that the current Attorney will not permit the delays which have existed in the past to continue. I just do not really see the point in preparing draft legislation when there is no certainty at all that there will be a change in law. I personally feel that the time to prepare the draft legislation is when the government says what it wants the new law to be. However, I am in a minority on that issue and I presume that the Law Reform Commission will, when it deems it appropriate, continue to prepare draft legislation to accompany reports passed on to the government for consideration.

         The question of international treaty obligations is a matter that has concerned me for a very long time. I outlined in the report the hypocrisy of the Labor government. One thing that did concern me greatly was the way that this country could sign and ratify a treaty by the Governor&amp;hyphen;General sitting in Executive Council with any two ministers. It could be binding on Australia even though the particular subject matter of that treaty had not been referred even to the cabinet, the ministry, the government party, either house of the parliament or the Australian people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know that the coalition has a more effective treaty making process. It has more appropriate procedures and these will progressively be put in place but, nevertheless, one of the problems that we have as a nation is that we have entered into some 2,000 treaties concerning a broad range of areas. No&amp;hyphen;one would object to some of those treaties but there are others where from time to time the collective values of the Australian community may change. If there is no provision for withdrawal from a treaty, either set out in the terms of the treaty or able to be implied from the terms of the treaty, then my understanding is that the only way that this country can withdraw from such a treaty is to go back and renegotiate with all of the other contracting parties to that treaty. Sometimes more than 100 countries sign a treaty and, therefore, there could be some treaties from which this country could never escape, should the values of the country no longer be represented by that treaty.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         International law is becoming increasingly important. Many people in my electorate would say, `Well, what we should do is simply tear a treaty up if we don't agree with the terms of it'. But, of course, that could put Australia out of step with its international obligations and we would not want Australia to be an international outlaw.

         As I said, I largely support the report of the committee. The government, naturally, supports this bill because it is a government bill. I am pleased that the opposition is joining with us in endorsing this particular piece of legislation. It will give, after some 23 years, an even more efficient Law Reform Commission to serve the people of Australia very well into the next century. I commend the bill to the Committee.

         —in reply—The government is very grateful to the opposition for its support of this bill, and I also would like to thank the member for Banks (Mr Melham), the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) and the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) for their contributions to the debate.

        Mention has been made by all speakers of the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in the previous parliament. I think that committee will stand as a model for the development of legislation in the national interest. I would like to think that there will be in this parliament and in future parliaments committees that will operate on that basis.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe its success was attributable to a number of things; its membership among others. The chairman, the member for Banks, was instrumental in its achievements because of his willingness to commit the committee to examination of issues on their merits. Most of the material that came before the committee was dealt with on a bipartisan basis and the selection of references has something to do with its success. But at the same time, under the chairmanship of the member for Banks, the issues were fairly and squarely addressed, and I congratulate him on his record in that respect. Other members of the committee made a significant contribution. The member for Fisher was a conscientious member, as were the former member for Holt and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair),
        <break page="3463" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         among others. I think the work of the House standing committees is important. It has been under&amp;hyphen;utilised and underestimated as a resource, but I think the selection of references is an important part of the success.

        In relation to the reference to that committee on the Australian Law Reform Commission as it is to become, that was a very thorough piece of work, reviewing a body which has functioned for many years and attained significant successes itself. The report is, in basic terms, a set of recommendations on the structure and operation, as well as the functions, of the commission. I think it will set a new direction for the commission in its operation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Banks suggested that the fingerprints of the previous government were all over it. I do not really agree with that. I think the fingerprints of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs are all over the report. While he suggested that the present government was going to score the try, I would see it as being a triumph for that previous committee.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Barton made some comments on a number of matters referred to in the report and in the bill. In particular, he referred to the proposals for implementing complementary state and territory laws, the proposal that in performing its functions the commission have regard to relevant treaty obligations and finally the obligations of the commission to have regard to the costs of access to justice. In the latter respect he particularly referred to court and tribunal fees proposed in yesterday's budget. I will not say anything about that; I will save comments for the appropriate time and the appropriate forum.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He also mentioned the reduced budget. In that respect, let me say the budget reductions to the ALRC were a component of clearly signalled policy in pursuance of the government's program of savings measures and were set out in its election document
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Meeting our Commitments
        </emphasis>
        . It is true that the savings will to some extent reduce the commission's capacity to undertake several major references at once but I have been assured by the commission that it will be able to progress all its current references as planned and it will be able to undertake a further major new reference commencing in the current financial year. It will still be possible to give the commission additional work. In particular, the commission will be able to take on additional references on issues where funding is provided, in effect, by a client department specifically on a direct reference basis. The savings will to some extent reduce the commission's extracurricular activities but the resultant strategic planning will mean that the commission will be more focused on its primary task of reporting and advising the government on priority areas of law reform.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Fisher mentioned his expressions of concern, which are in the report of the House Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Commonwealth Law Reform Commission suggestion was not picked up by the other members of the committee. In fact, the recommendation that the committee be called the ALRC is merely a reflection of common parlance. It has for many years been referred to as the Australian Law Reform Commission or the ALRC, despite the statute naming it the Law Reform Commission.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The subject of draft legislation was debated at length within the committee. The views of the member for Fisher are well known on the subject. My personal view expressed repeatedly in those debates was that, in many instances, a commission would use the mechanism of drafting legislation as a means of identifying issues for consideration in the course of a reference, whether the draft legislation was sought by the actual reference, and whether that draft legislation was appended to the report.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Finally, in relation to treaties, I think that the member for Fisher can rest easy because the coalition's policy has been effectively implemented. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Downer) and I on 2 May, the second sitting day of this government, introduced a number of measures and, subsequent to that, we have had the formation of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. COAG, at its meeting in June, established a Treaties Council, involving the state and territory governments. The commission will, under the bill, in performing its functions have regard to all relevant treaty obligations.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In closing the debate, I submit that the proposed legislation is a demonstration of the government's commitment to having a viable law reform agency which is able to advise it on keeping Australia's laws up to date. The government agrees with the committee chaired by the member for Banks in its recognition of the importance of having a permanent and separate agency to provide detailed policy advice on law reform matters to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General and the parliament.

I think that it needs to be acknowledged that the reason that this is happening often in the early part of this session—and I will give the background to this—is that one needs to acknowledge that the current government has picked up virtually all of the previous government's bills. We need to acknowledge the tremendous work that was put in by the previous Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, the Hon.

        However, I acknowledge the tremendous commitment to law reform of the previous Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, the Hon. Michael Lavarch, and the current member for Denison. It is true that in the last parliament—and, again, it needs to be acknowledged—many of the reforms were reforms championed by another previous Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, my good friend the Hon. Michael Duffy. The contribution that he made when he was Attorney&amp;hyphen;General was not acknowledged enough, unfortunately. That contribution carried on after he left that office because many of the reforms that others picked up and ran with were reforms that he initiated.

        This bill follows an exhaustive review of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, held in consultation with the private profession, representative civil liberties groups and interested government agencies.

        In August 1994, the former Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, the Hon. Michael Lavarch, approved the circulation of an issues paper to all federal, state and territory prosecution and investigation agencies, law societies, bar associations, the Law Council of Australia and representative civil liberties associations. All but two recommendations in the issues paper were accepted by all respondents.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In mid&amp;hyphen;1995, the previous Labor government approved the introduction of legislation to implement the recommendations in the review paper, plus a number of additional technical matters and two additions specifically requested by the previous Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, the Hon. Michael Lavarch. This needs to be acknowledged. There was the specific death penalty refusal ground which is in the act. It is currently clause 41, and I will come to that shortly. That provision, I might add, was also supported by the member for Denison, the previous Minister for Justice, and that has been picked up by this government. So what my good friend the Hon. Michael Duffy used to call `the hangers and the floggers' have not had their way in relation to this act.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The other provision was to enable a defendant to apply to a foreign country for assistance. That was something that the previous Attorney&amp;hyphen;General championed. It has been picked up in this bill because that legislation was not introduced before the election. But this bill, certainly as introduced, implements the policy agreed by cabinet in May 1995, as I say, including the clause in relation to the death penalty and the one on access to defendants.

        In particular, I want to talk about item 41, subclauses 8(1A) and 8(1B). Basically, it is worthwhile reading on to the record what is in the explanatory memorandum, because I think that sets it all out. It states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        59. This item inserts 2 new subclauses after subsection 8(1) relating to refusal of assistance in relation to offences carrying the death penalty in the requesting country.

        60. Subclause 8(1A) provides that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General must refuse a request for assistance from a foreign country if it relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with or convicted of an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed; the subsection allows the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General limited discretion to grant the assistance sought if there are special circumstances in the particular case. Such circumstances would arise if the evidence sought could be exculpatory. Normally assistance would not be granted unless the requesting state gave an assurance that the death penalty, if imposed, would not be carried out. However it would not be appropriate for Australia to insist that an assurance be given in
        <break page="3466" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        61. Item 41 also inserts new subclause 8(1B) which provides that, if the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General believes provision of the assistance may result in the death penalty being imposed on a person, the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General may refuse the assistance, after taking into account the interests of international criminal co&amp;hyphen;operation, if the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is of the opinion that in the circumstances of the case assistance should be refused.

Subclause 8(1B) applies where charges have not yet been laid in the foreign country. In such requests it is intended that there be more discretion available to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to grant assistance. In the exercise of the discretion the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General may take into account the interests of international criminal co&amp;hyphen;operation (including the desire to maximise possibilities of reciprocal assistance by the foreign country to Australia and of the general international interest in cross&amp;hyphen;jurisdictional assistance in serious criminal matters) and the surrounding circumstances of the case.

You only have to look at the `Birmingham four' and the `Guildford six'. You only have to look at the number of commissions around Australia today, and the reports to the parliament, to see the level of corruption that exists and has now tainted some—not all—convictions. I am not a proponent of the death penalty—of state&amp;hyphen;induced death—and I commend the government for putting that clause in.

        I think it is proper and appropriate to acknowledge that it was the previous Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, the Hon. Michael Lavarch, and the previous Minister for Justice who championed this clause going into the drafting instructions. It certainly enriches the legislation. It is the way it should be, and there should be no apologies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is not to say that there is not the odd critic or the odd person who does not believe in that clause. We are never going to have unanimous agreement. But I think it has been a considered discussion paper and it has been considered legislation. That is the way legislation in this area should be dealt with: it should be open to scrutiny. We, as a parliament, should be inviting public scrutiny.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We should be achieving cross&amp;hyphen;party support where possible. These issues are above politics. These issues are important, and it is important that they be dealt with in a cross&amp;hyphen;party manner. I commend the government, in this regard, for bringing this legislation in, and I do not apologise for that. Too often there is a misconception in the community that we are always fighting with one another and scoring cheap political points. The reverse is true. The tragedy is that the modern&amp;hyphen;day reporting of parliament—indeed, the only reporting that the media are interested in doing—consists of the clashes that we have, because it is popular television stuff.

         They are only interested in confrontation and not in consultation or conciliation. They are not interested in showing pictures of peaceful demonstrators, or whatever.

        That is why we, as an opposition, are consistently getting up and supporting these pieces of legislation. It shows that, in this area, there has been cross&amp;hyphen;party support, and that the legislation which we introduced was not bad legislation, because it has been picked up by the current government. They deserve the credit for that, and we will give credit where it is due. With those remarks, I commend the legislation to the committee and to the House. The opposition will assist in giving it speedy passage.

         —I speak today in support of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The principal act came into force on 1 August 1988 and has been described as one of the most far&amp;hyphen;reaching statutes on criminal law and criminal procedure ever enacted by an Australian legislature. It provides the statutory basis for Australia to enter into arrangements with other countries when requesting information or the prosecution of cross&amp;hyphen;border crime and the recovery of assets, including moneys, obtained as a result of that crime.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A review of the Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements of February 1994 reported that the nature of major and organised crime had changed. Known criminal organisations and networks in Australia and other countries have increased in size and power. The technology they use is more difficult to log and monitor. Many criminal organisations have developed interests beyond their countries of origin. Organisations and networks based in other countries are now represented in Australia or have links with Australian&amp;hyphen;based networks.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, in particular, has provided invaluable assistance to the Australian law enforcement authorities—including the federal and state police forces, the National Crime Authority and the Australian Customs Service—in the conduct of transnational criminal cases, particularly on crimes such as drug trafficking. The key to the amendments to the act provided for in this bill is the improvements which have come about as a result of consultation with law enforcement, legal and civil liberties organisations. I speak in particular of the measure that the member for Banks (Mr Melham) referred to at length. This is the critical measure which includes the provision that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General must refuse assistance from a foreign country if it relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with, or convicted of, an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This provision is extremely important because in practice, before, we were allowed avenues of refusal in respect of these circumstances if the matter was non&amp;hyphen;specific to the death penalty. This provision will reflect Australia's policy, given that the death penalty has been abolished since 1984 in all Australian states and that we are party to the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This amendment does, however, allow the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General discretion to grant assistance sought, if there are special circumstances in the particular case: for example, where the assistance sought is exculpatory in nature and establishes the innocence of, or else exonerates, the defendant.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another key amendment allows for a residual non&amp;hyphen;specific refusal ground where, in the opinion of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, it is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case that the request for assistance should not be granted. Previously, assistance could only be granted to
        <break page="3468" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         countries to which the act applied by regulation, and regulations would only be made where Australia had faith in the criminal justice system of that particular country.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Previously, a request for cooperation from a country not mentioned in our regulations could encounter a delay of at least eight weeks while regulations were made by the Federal Executive Council. Such a delay could considerably undermine the effectiveness of the act for investigative and prosecution agencies. Assistance can now be provided and requested much more expeditiously.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Amendments also deal with court applications by the defendant, restrictions on the use of information received, court&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;court applications to take evidence and other amendments mostly of a technical or mechanical nature. All will improve the operation of the act which has proved absolutely necessary for Australia to counter transnational crime, including drug trafficking and other forms of organised crime, and will also show us, in the international arena, as jealous of civil and political rights, which we hold most dear in this country. I therefore commend the bill to this committee and ask that it receive wholehearted support.

         —In speaking on the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 I would like to commend the substance of the majority bill as an obvious improvement in the development of our criminal justice relations with other nations. I have a number of concerns I would like to address in relation to aspects of the bill.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In particular, I want to answer a couple of the points made by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) when he talked about `hangers and floggers' as being the axis on which this bill rotates. Of course, there are some other issues related to the provisions of 8(1A) and 8(1B). The clause which concerns me is 8(1A) which says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A request by a foreign country for assistance under this Act must be refused if it relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with, or convicted of, an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed in the foreign country, unless the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is of the opinion, having regard to the special circumstances of the case, that the assistance required should be granted.
       </para>
       <para>
        The difficulty I have with that is that it effectively places a blanket ban, with very few exceptions, on the exchange of information in a particular circumstance relating to what may have been, for instance, a particularly heinous offence. It may relate to drug trafficking offences, for instance, in the case of some of our neighbours in South&amp;hyphen;East Asia. In my view, it effectively puts an untenable restriction on some valuable exchanges of information in relation to our own criminal justice objectives—in particular, of course, the war against drug trafficking within our nation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If I can just make an observation, we are effectively losing the fight against the importation of illicit drugs. That has been acknowledged by a number of experts around the country, including the previous chairman of the National Crime Authority, Mr Tom Sherman, and a range of commentators whose expertise and knowledge is not in question. We have an extraordinary problem with the importation of drugs in this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the case of Western Australia it has been calculated that each year up to $1 billion worth of illicit drugs comes across that part of the frontier that is Western Australia. There was a statistic a couple of years ago that, within a radius of 100 kilometres of Geraldton, $300 million worth of illicit drugs entered in one year. These are mind&amp;hyphen;boggling statistics. When one considers the damage, the social effects and the dire necessity to combat this with the absolute maximum resources available to us, then quite clearly when we look at our
        <break page="3469" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         relationship with other nations, particularly those in our region, this bill starts to take a pivotal importance in that relationship and section 8(1A) then has significance and importance in our dealings with our neighbouring countries.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have to acknowledge that the vast proportion of illicit drugs are coming from our immediate neighbourhood. They are essentially entering our shores from our own particular region. Our regional neighbours, in many instances, are making significant attempts to combat organised drug trafficking—a highly profitable and, of course, corrupting influence—within their own countries. Obviously, this is something that troubles them, as it troubles us. It seems to me that it makes it extraordinarily difficult for Australia to be able to participate fully in a cooperative arrangement within its own region when it introduces legislation that puts a blanket ban on assistance, which includes the exchange of information, matters to do with extradition, et cetera.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The act says that assistance must be refused `if it relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with, or convicted of, an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed in the foreign country'. The reason for that is that a large number of countries, not only in our region but elsewhere, still retain the death penalty on their books. Some of the states of the United States actually impose a death penalty as part of their criminal justice processes. In relation to section 8(1A), clearly this should be amended in the interests of greater international cooperation in the fight against drugs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are some aspects of this that may relate to the question of war crimes. As I have been advised, in relation to war crimes being dealt with by the United Nations, there are specific provisions that take away the death penalty for war crimes being investigated and subsequently prosecuted by the War Crimes Tribunal. But, as we know, that tribunal has a limited life. There are attempts to establish a standing war crimes commission but I believe that at the end of the day—I am sure there are a number of people who would agree with me—it is more likely that nations will use their own criminal justice systems to investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible, if convicted, for war crimes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are a number of countries in our region that are important in the fight against organised crime and drug trafficking. They include Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea—although it is abolitionist de facto—Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. There is also the United States of America and, in eastern Europe, Bosnia&amp;hyphen;Herzegovina. There are a number of others on the list but I want to deal specifically with our immediate region, for obvious reasons.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At a conference held in Sydney in 1994 on organised crime in Asia, organised jointly by the National Crime Authority and the Australian Federal Police, there were a considerable number of complaints raised by representatives of agencies from our regional neighbours that this particular restriction—which has existed de facto up until now, and I commend the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General for attempting to codify this in the act—has impeded better and more effective criminal investigations within our region.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I make the observation that our attitude is governed, to a certain extent, by our federal government's policy in relation to capital punishment. Of course, Australia is an abolitionist nation. Whatever one's view of capital punishment may be, the fact of the matter is that a number of our neighbouring nations have a different view. They have a view, of course, that
        <break page="3470" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         in cases of serious drug trafficking offences capital punishment ought to be available on their statute books. It is being made available most notably in Malaysia and Thailand.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That effectively means that, in the case where a person has been arrested and prosecuted in relation to an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed, the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General must refuse assistance. That is, in my view, a blanket ban that not only is not conducive to better and more effective criminal justice investigation relations with those neighbouring nations, but also effectively makes the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's position more difficult. Of course, it provides for that `unless the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is of the opinion, having regard to the special circumstances of the case, that the assistance requested should be granted'. In other words, the requirement is that the circumstances should be sufficiently strong for the blanket ban to be overturned.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is a matter of some importance in the debate on the question of organised crime and drug trafficking. It is something that I think is a contentious issue. It is an issue that deserves a fuller debate. In my view, it deserves a debate in the main chamber of the House of Representatives. I believe it is important that the community sees that we are treating this matter with seriousness, that we are exploring its complete ramifications and, if and when the decision is made to amend the bill or to carry the bill in its current form, that it is made at the conclusion of a thoroughgoing and informative debate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I for one would like to listen to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's expanded views on this particular provision, so that he can explain them to members of the community, many of whom are disquieted about the international drug trafficking problem that exists in relation to our own country. I recently made a visit to Interpol and the National Criminal Intelligence Service in Britain, and know that international drug trafficking is a matter of growing concern and a matter that many leading criminal investigators from various agencies concede is causing extraordinary concerns around the world. The transnational nature of its activities makes it extraordinarily difficult for an individual nation to be able to stamp out or stop it within its own territory. That is why international cooperation and the exchange of information and evidence is absolutely critical.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Clearly, no&amp;hyphen;one would expect the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to permit assistance in the case where, for instance, a country with a criminal justice system that is highly questionable was involved: where, for instance, the standards of evidence and other standards might be completely below what we would consider the acceptable minimum. Clearly, nobody would expect that to be the case. I believe, in the circumstances I have described, that with the amendment that would still be provided for. It is just that, in this particular instance, the `must' in line one of section 8(1A) is a blanket ban. It remains then for the case to be put that the special circumstances of the case are so overwhelming that that blanket ban should be overturned.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are many people around the country who very are concerned about our problems with drug trafficking. It is safe to say that drug trafficking is at the base of much criminal activity within our country. The
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Economist
        </emphasis>
        magazine in June commented that you are more likely to be burgled, robbed or assaulted without a weapon in Australia than in the United States. For instance, in my state the statistics show that in some of the leading criminal activities the rate is almost twice the average of the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If one concludes that at the base of much of our criminal activity is drug trafficking, and I suppose the associated activities in relation to drug trafficking, if we do not make the fight against drugs our number one objective we are going to see some extraordinary problems in
        <break page="3471" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the future—problems that will make our current situation seem small beer in comparison. Recent statistics that have been shown to me in the case of European countries show that they have seen a mushrooming of drug trafficking to an extent that is almost mind&amp;hyphen;boggling, where criminal justice police agencies have little effect on being able to stop it or stamp it out.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We know, for instance, even where one considers changes to the law to provide for the decriminalisation of marijuana or similar proposals that some people sincerely believe will help alleviate our drug problem in Australia, that the people responsible for trafficking drugs will cynically manipulate the market to provide cheaper, more pure, other drugs—for instance, heroin. The other day we saw in Western Australia the recovery of a bag of a substantial amount of an illicit drug—believed to be cocaine—on an inbound British Airways jet that had arrived at Perth. We are now faced, along with a number of other nations, with an explosion of drug trafficking. We are faced, in the case of the prevailing budget as of last night, with very substantial cuts to the Australian Federal Police, cuts that I believe will have a deleterious effect on our fight against drug trafficking and cuts that come in conjunction with cuts in other areas in recent times, particularly the Australian Customs Service and the National Crime Authority.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In totality, these cuts are going to impede our fight against organised crime, but in particular our fight against drug trafficking. We have seen reported at the Wood royal commission the corruption of police, corruption of the judiciary, corruption of politicians and corruption of business people, and often at the base of this is the profit making that is available in the trafficking of illicit drugs. So it has a tremendous social effect.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Here we have a situation where, at this very point, we are prepared to let this particular bill travel through the Main Committee as a non&amp;hyphen;contentious piece of legislation when section 8(1A) provides for a blanket ban on the assistance available in cases where we are dealing with a number of the nations in our region which have, in some instances, an equally strong commitment to the fight against drug trafficking. I make my case that this will impede rather than help that relationship and will not contribute to better cooperation between our countries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Drug trafficking is an international menace. Anybody who thinks otherwise ought to think again. It is transnational. It is, in many instances, a chain that stretches around the globe. If we believe for one minute that this particular section is going to assist our opportunity to participate in an international fight against drug trafficking then we really ought to think again. And if we believe that this is non&amp;hyphen;contentious—in other words, should travel through the Main Committee without demur—then we also, I think, are failing the community. This ought to be back in the House of Representatives main chamber and, Mr Deputy Speaker, at the conclusion I intend to move that further proceedings be conducted in the House in order that amendments may be considered.

        The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act has been in force for almost 10 years. Clearly, as with any initiative, it is appropriate that its effectiveness and efficiency be reviewed and in that context we have this bill before us. There was wide&amp;hyphen;ranging consultation in the review with the government, the private sector, law enforcement agencies and civil liberty groups. At the end of the day, this process has ensured that we have the best possible solutions in the form of this legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is particularly grateful for the support of the opposition and the honourable member for Murray regarding the death penalty issue. The honourable member for Moore has, however, foreshadowed some concerns that he has in relation to this matter. I want to make it very clear that I do not think anybody in the parliament would demur on what he has had to say about the importance of fighting drug trafficking. The questions are: in what way do you deal with these particular issues and what impact might they have? This matter has been discussed with the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General and I am informed that he is not prepared to agree to any amendments. Obviously, if this means the bill needs to be considered in detail in the Main Committee, that is an issue which will be addressed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would, however, point out to the honourable member for Moore that section 8(1A) deals with the position specifically where charges have been laid and where a person is charged with or convicted of an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed. His concerns about assistance in cases where charges have not been laid are dealt with in clause 8(1B) where there is a far broader discretion to provide the assistance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I note also that I understand the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, in relation to 8(1A), has a discretion to grant assistance sought if there are special circumstances in the particular case. Normally assistance would not be granted unless the requesting state gave an assurance that the death penalty, if imposed, would not be carried out. I think there is a basis for dialogue where cooperation is sought. Cooperation would only be denied if a state were not willing to give the assurance that even if the death penalty was imposed it would not be carried out. To those who are interested in this question of what the role of the state ought to be in these matters that, to my way of thinking, does not seem to be an unreasonable basis upon which to deal with this difficult issue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has considered the issues raised by the honourable member for Moore. It considers that it has the right solution and would ask that he reconsider his approach in relation to this matter so we can have the legislation. If he intends to persist with his amendment obviously he will seek the referral.

         —I do not want to see this particular instance becoming a debate between whether one supports the death penalty or otherwise; it is a question of whether or not the blanket ban imposed on subsection 8(1A) proposed by clause 41, as the amendment to the principal act, would in fact impede our relations with countries where the death penalty is still on the statute books.

        I know, from having read the explanatory memorandum and from having had the opportunity of a briefing from officers of the department, that an assurance may be sought from the nation which has the particular penalty on the books that the death penalty will not be imposed. That would then be the basis on which assistance may be given.

        All I am saying is that, in this particular instance, the blanket ban is the problem here. In my view, that should be changed from `must' to `may' and the last clause of section 8(1A), that is, `Unless the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is of the opinion. . . ' continuing until the full stop, should be deleted.

        I believe that, were this to be more widely debated in the community, many people around the country would have some serious problems with it. At the end of the day, we still have the provision allowing the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to refuse assistance; in other words, the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General has the discretion available to him or her. The clause then would allow for assistance without the blanket ban being applicable.

         —I would like to respond briefly. The comments I made in relation to subclause 8(1A) were that the Attorney, under that subsection, does have a discretion to grant assistance sought if there are special circumstances and normally assistance would not be granted unless the requesting state gave an assurance that the death penalty, if imposed, would not be carried out.

        In those circumstances, we are in a situation where, notwithstanding the use of the word `must', there is a basis upon which cooperation can be sought, and the government considers it reasonable that the condition of the offer of that assistance is not that the country concerned changes its system of law, but that it simply gives us an assurance that the death penalty, if imposed, would not be carried out. That does not seem to be an unreasonable requirement. And if the issues that you are saying are as important to those who are investigating these matters and have brought charges, it seems to me that that cooperation, if it is important, should not be difficult to obtain.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is in that context that we believe that this is a cooperative arrangement which can be operated to give assistance but which does not leave us in a situation where we are a party, in effect, to the application of a death penalty to people when we are in a position to aid the prosecution in relation to a particular matter. I am surprised that what is, in fact, a matter that has been the subject of very long consideration and consultation still worries the honourable member.

        The irony is somewhat rich. We actually helped train the troops from a neighbouring country that has recently been responsible for killing innocent citizens of its own nation. Yet here, in the case of, say, a drug trafficker who is responsible for drug trafficking, we would impose a requirement that that nation provide a guarantee that the death penalty would not be applied in that particular case. In my view, that requirement is too onerous and it is an impediment to better cooperation in our region. And let's face it, on both sides of the political process both the previous government and the current government have obviously expounded on the greater relationship with our Asian neighbours.

        All I am saying is that this provision has in it an implication that we are asserting that in the case of, say, Malaysia or Singapore, aspects of their criminal justice system are so abhorrent to us that we would not cooperate in the investigation of a very serious offence. We are talking about offences ranging from murder to war crimes, and all the way through to, in some instances, very serious drug trafficking offences. My view is that at the end of the day, that would be seen to be a stumbling block in the way of better cooperative efforts at a time when we need cooperation. We do not want to put impediments in the way; we should be removing them.

        As far as the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) raising subsection 8(1B), I have no problem with it at all. It is just this particular section that I believe would attract a fair amount of interest and opposition from around the country from those who believe, as I do, that any of these sorts of impediments ought to be removed and that, at the end of the day, a blanket ban is not in our best interests.

         —I would like to answer a couple of those points. Firstly, I understand that the comments by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) are correct; I understand to what object this particular clause relates. I am just saying that, in this instance, I believe there should be discretion for the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General in order to be able to consider the matter. If you look at it carefully—the wording says `unless the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is of the opinion, having regard to the special circumstances of the case'—there is no provision in there, in fact, for there to be a guarantee. It just mentions having regard to the special circumstances of the case.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The guarantee is a policy matter. It is a matter of international relations between Australia and whichever country is applicable. It does not codify there exactly what is required for the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to be satisfied of the special circumstances. But, from the explanatory memorandum, we know that that is in fact a guarantee by the nation concerned—the prosecuting nation—that the death penalty would not be applied in that case.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I understand also that it relates to prosecution or punishment. The punishment is a secondary issue, and that is why I would still give the discretion to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General. It is a question of prosecution. I add that, as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs would know, in some of these cases during the prosecution evidence of the activities of accomplices is revealed. These might be accomplices within Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that where there is a transnational conspiracy there is going to be the revealing of evidence that would perhaps give rise to, if the person were available, the prosecution of an Australian citizen. In that case, there is a clear provision there for the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to exercise his discretion. But there may also be evidence that Australians hold, or may be able to provide, that may facilitate the breaking of an international cartel of drug traffickers. It is my view that the onerous requirement imposed, not necessarily by the actual wording of the bill but by the policy statement in the explanatory memorandum, is too onerous. As a consequence, I propose the amendment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not disagree with the minister. If one were to put it to a referendum, perhaps most Australians would support the abolition of the death penalty. I am sure they would support Australia's general policy to support its abolition wherever it can. But, at the same time, I think that there would be many in the community—I believe it would be the majority—who would also see an impedance like this as being outside that particular objective.

        <para first-indent="16">
         After all, this bill is designed to be a bill on mutual assistance in criminal matters, not a policy of Australia on trying to further its own particular conviction that capital punishment ought to be abolished. This is where we are endeavouring to arrive at agreements with other countries as to assistance relating to criminal investigation and criminal prosecutions. I repeat: all I am saying is that the blanket ban and the onerous requirement in the final clause of that particular section are an impedance. I am yet to be convinced by the minister at the table.

        There are other sections, as I indicated, in which cooperation can be sought. In relation to the conspiracy argument possibly involving Australians, section 8(1A) would not arise. We are dealing with a situation in which people would then be dealt with under our law. The application of our law in relation to the use of the evidence and information that we might have would be in relation to a prosecution of people here. So I do not understand the connection that the honourable member is trying to make regarding the argument of conspiracy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will contain my remarks, save to emphasise that the honourable member is seeking to use discretionary words in relation to the general principle. The discretion is, in fact, obtained through the special circumstances in a particular case. As has been noted, where assistance will be offered is where a state has agreed that, if a prosecution which involves the death penalty is secured, an assurance that the death penalty will not be carried out will be sufficient to secure the cooperation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That does not seem to be at all unreasonable. It does involve an element of discretion that can be obtained through the willingness of two states to cooperate. I do not think the divisions are very significant.

         —The opposition will of course not be opposing the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. Why would we? It is exactly the same bill that we introduced when in government in November last year. This debate also provides me with an opportunity to reflect briefly on the work and the contribution made by the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Con Sciacca. Regrettably, whilst Australia remembered in 1995, in 1996 they seem to have forgotten Con in his own electorate. I think it is one of the great pities of the recent election loss for the Australian Labor Party that Con Sciacca was not returned to this place.

        As I have been travelling around, both in the company of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) and, indeed, on my own, from talking to people in the veterans community I have been absolutely staggered and overwhelmed by the comments made by the veterans in respect of the contribution made by Con Sciacca.

For those very reasons he was, and continues to be, much loved.

        It is important that, in considering the legislation before the committee today, we again pay tribute to the work that Con did as minister: it was, after all, his legislation. I certainly commend the present government for continuing with this matter and for bringing it forward. As we have seen, there is absolutely no disagreement between the government and the opposition in respect of it.

        The document itself, as was commented in the explanatory memorandum, actually gives effect to two particular matters. The first element is to amend the Defence Service Homes Act of 1918 and to incorporate certain provisions of the consumer credit code that is to be adopted by state and territory governments during the course of this year. It is also going to allow defence service homes scheme beneficiaries rights under the consumer credit code for matters not specified in this amending bill. The second element of this legislation is to amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act of 1986, to streamline the granting of a pension to a dependant of a veteran who dies from a war&amp;hyphen;caused injury or disease.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me take the second of those amendments first and comment briefly. I do not think that any member of parliament who has contact with the veterans community would not be aware of the trauma for many veterans in proving that illness, or some debilitation, is war related. Then, after they have succeeded in doing so, when they pass away their dependant is faced with that same element of proof. This amendment removes that. This amendment says that once it has been established that a veteran is entitled to some form of assistance, some pension, some entitlement under the veterans' affairs legislation and—having proved that beyond all reasonable doubt—is granted that entitlement, then the dependant of that veteran is similarly given that entitlement on the death of the applicant.

          This is very significant and very important. It removes trauma. It is going to take away the difficulties often confronting dependants who have gone through the process of establishing an entitlement and receiving the benefit, together with the person in receipt of the benefit, but who then have that lifelong partner pass away. They are faced with the double whammy, if you like, of firstly having to cope with that and then having to go through the process again of establishing an entitlement. To remove that trauma is very important.

         I commend the government for adopting this measure, which was put in place and brought forward last year by the former government and by the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and I congratulate the government for continuing to ensure that veterans and, more importantly with this particular provision, their dependants, are given care, comfort and support.

         The second issue concerns the amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. We know that consumer issues in financial services are ones which are very near and dear to the hearts of all of us. We are all consumers at the end of the day. It does not matter if you are a veteran, it does not matter if you are a member of parliament. What you want to know and what you want to be protected by are some guarantees in consumer codes in respect of all of your transactions with financial institutions.

        <para first-indent="16">
         That is particularly so in respect of the purchase of homes. After all, for most people the purchase of a home is in fact the acquiring of the largest asset that they are ever going to make a commitment for. One would hope, therefore, that when making that commitment they are given appropriate consumer guidance and that the decisions they make and any contractual obligations they enter into have force of law and, importantly, bring consumer benefits.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This amendment to the Defence Service Homes Act will give those additional benefits that states and territories are now adopting in respect of the Consumer Credit Code. Again I commend the government for bringing this forward as part of this legislation. It again follows on from legislation which the former government introduced last year.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting, however, when in the context of last night's budget announcements one goes to budget statements and Budget Paper No. 1 to look at this issue of defence service homes. I want to raise very quickly one or two matters out of that, and would hope that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs might take on board a couple of the questions I am going to pose now because I think the veterans community would certainly like to hear from the minister on these matters.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At page 3&amp;hyphen;126 of Budget Paper No. 1 there is reference to defence service homes in the forward estimates for 1996&amp;hyphen;97. If one looks at the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget, one sees that it is suggested that some $50.9 million will be made available for defence service homes but that in fact is a reduction of 1.4 per cent. Fortunately, in 1997&amp;hyphen;98 the estimated expenditure in the forward estimates is going up again to $55.3 million, which estimates an 8.6 per cent increase, but it is estimated that in 1998&amp;hyphen;99 expenditure will decrease again to $53.2 million, a reduction of 3.8 per cent. It is to go up marginally, by 0.8 per cent, to $53.6 million, according to the forward estimates for the 1999&amp;hyphen;2000 budget.

          It strikes me that this is a bit of a roller&amp;hyphen;coaster ride. Perhaps it reflects trends in the marketplace which the Department of Veterans' Affairs is aware of. If that is the case, then obviously there is no concern and no cause for alarm. It is incumbent upon us—and I am speaking now as a member of parliament who will be approached by members of the veterans community rather than as the shadow minister—to know what this means and whether a smoothing out effect will ultimately occur. What that probably does reflect, as I have speculated, is changes in demand of the use of the program at different times, or perhaps interest rate fluctuations which the government is banking on. I am not sure whether that roller&amp;hyphen;coaster ride over the next four years indicates when interest rates are likely to go up or come down—perhaps we might look at that a little more closely and all race out and purchase property! It is an issue that is of concern. I ask the minister to give us a response to that.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Similarly, at page 3&amp;hyphen;127 of Budget Paper No. 1, under subprogram 7.2, `Defence Service Homes', it is noted under `home acquisition assistance' that the budget for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 is $54.3 million, which represents a two per cent decrease on 1995&amp;hyphen;96. Again, however, one sees a reflection of the roller&amp;hyphen;coaster ride factor, which I mentioned with regard to the forward estimates, in that it is proposed that the amount increases by 7.2 per cent in 1997&amp;hyphen;98, decreases by 1.2 per cent in 1998&amp;hyphen;99, and increases by 0.9 per cent in the 1999&amp;hyphen;2000 budget. I guess this reflects something of demand again. However, it would be appreciated if the minister could give us some indication about that so that the veterans community, and members of parliament who counsel veterans about these issues, will be better informed.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The other thing which is of concern to us all is the decision taken by the government to extract from departments a two per cent across&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;board running cost reduction. The minister could suggest to us what that might mean in terms of delivery of services by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to that very important group in the community that is in need of special care and assistance.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I understand that potentially we are going to see something like a 10 per cent reduction in staffing within the Department of Veterans' Affairs as a result of the decision that the government has taken to reduce running costs. I understand that one way in which departments have approached that—and we have seen headlines about it—is by cutting staff numbers. I appreciate that a simple way of doing that within departments is to follow that principle and shed staff. I would caution the Department of Veterans' Affairs, in looking at ways to achieve cost&amp;hyphen;cutting measures, to reflect upon the delivery mechanism that might be impacted upon by such a decision.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This cost cutting is imposed by the government. Make no mistake about it, the government says there has to be a two per cent reduction in running costs and the simple way to do that is to cut staff numbers. Obviously, the Department of Veterans' Affairs cannot be immune from that if it is to meet that objective. However, the close relationship between the staff of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the veterans community is more than simply a client&amp;hyphen;service provider relationship. It is much closer than that. If you talk to any veteran about it, he will tell you how important it is to have access to people within the department.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I hope a reduction in service will not be brought about by this decision. We must not impede the ability of the department to continue to deliver services to the veterans community. It is too important generally, across a whole range of programs, for that to occur. I again raise that as an allied issue associated with this particular piece of legislation that is before us today.

           I conclude by again commending the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca, for his work in this portfolio. I congratulate the present minister, Mr Scott, for maintaining the commitment of this parliament, and not just the government, to the veterans community. Veterans' affairs is very much a bipartisan area. Regrettably, there are too few of those areas of bipartisanship that we can all reflect upon with some pride and sense of joy. When matters such as this are addressed by budgets or through legislation, we should not be afraid of coming out and commending the present government for any initiatives that it brings forward. I am doing so, and I wish this legislation a speedy passage through the House. I know it is supported by everybody and, as a consequence, wish it well.

         —I will comment briefly on the remarks made by the shadow minister concerning the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Con Sciacca. Like many other people in the House, I had a very warm and high regard for Con and the way in which he carried out his duties as Minister for Veterans' Affairs in a bipartisan way. I am well aware of the fact that on Remembrance Day last year he came to my electorate, opening a memorial walkway in Caloundra. As he recognised, the Sunshine Coast is not a hotbed of Labor support, and was never likely to be, yet he came to my area, as minister. I know that his visit was very warmly received by members of the veterans community.

        I wish Con a long and happy retirement outside politics. I am quite certain that he will be as successful in the business community, post&amp;hyphen;politics, as indeed he was prior to entering parliament. I knew Con prior to his entry into politics, when both he and I were solicitors in Queensland. As I said, I wish him well in the future and certainly believe that he has the capacity to make a very great contribution to the business community.

        Having said that, I am confident that the honourable member for Bowman (Mrs West), who was elected on 2 March, will do a wonderful job for a very long time on behalf of her constituents. While I have been very generous with my comments on Mr Sciacca and his performance as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I was very pleased to see the honourable member for Bowman win her seat as part of the landslide on 2 March.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As the shadow minister indicated, this is largely a bipartisan area. I think it was one of the wartime Labor prime ministers who in effect said it was important—these are my words—that a grateful nation should be as generous as it possibly can be to those to whom we owe so much. I know over the years there has been a feeling in the veterans community from time to time that governments have not done as much as they should have done. I remember when I was in the parliament in the 1980s that there was a very great concern that the then Labor government was going to abolish the Department of Veterans' Affairs or maybe merge it with the Department of Social Security. That was a matter of great concern for many. Fortunately that issue worked its way through and that amalgamation never came to fruition. We now have a situation where both sides of politics recognise the important work done on behalf of the veterans community by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The previous minister should be commended on this bill, as indeed should his successor, because this is important legislation; legislation which will ensure that veterans continue to get a fair go from those who owe them so much. After all, as a nation, we enjoy freedom, stability and a way of life that is the envy of people throughout the world. I hate to think what would have been the situation in Australia if it had not been for the contribution made by those who now form part of our veterans community.

         As was mentioned by the shadow minister, there are two arms to this legislation. The first arm relates to amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 which will ensure that, if it has been established that a veteran suffered from an injury or disease that was war caused, then the death of that veteran will also be taken to be war caused. I interjected on the shadow minister to point out how difficult it has been for dependants to prove that a death was war caused after the veteran has passed on. A primary source of evidence is lost, causing dependants to have to argue these cases before the tribunals.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This has been unfair and the legislation incorporating this change is very important. It brings a new level of fairness to the dependants of veterans and so I commend the government for ensuring that if a veteran has died from an injury or disease that has already been determined by the Repatriation Commission to be war caused, then that death is to be taken to have been war caused also.

        <para first-indent="16">
         A large number of people have contacted me, in my capacity as the member for Fisher, in relation to aspects of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Now that this problem is being remedied many of my constituents will be very pleased.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The second arm of the legislation relates to amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. The Defence Service Homes Act is being amended to incorporate certain provisions of the Consumer Credit Code that will come into effect on 1 November 1996. Over the years there has been, quite appropriately in my view, increasing emphasis on the rights of consumers and the need to be fair to consumers. As the shadow minister pointed out, all Australians are consumers, and it is very important that consumers are protected under the laws of this land.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am pleased that the states and territories have been able to negotiate and achieve a situation where we are able to have a uniform Consumer Credit Code. It is appropriate that after the code comes into force those people eligible for housing assistance under the defence service homes scheme will gain consumer rights comparable to those of other borrowers. I do not think any reasonable person in the community—certainly nobody in the parliament—is suggesting that that should not be the case.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One fairly important aspect of the Consumer Credit Code addressed by the bill is the payment of loan interest subsidy to the Westpac Banking Corporation, which provides defence service home loans to veterans and other eligible people under an agreement with the Commonwealth. Prior to this arrangement being entered into with the Westpac Banking Corporation, loans were made directly by the Commonwealth to veterans. The former government made a positive move when it effectively contracted these matters out to the Westpac Bank and I am pleased that that bank is going to continue to provide subsidised defence service home loans.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have had a number of complaints from veterans who say that perhaps the level of the loan has not been increased in line with the increases in the prices of homes over the years. Once, of course, a defence service home loan could be the primary source of finance for a home buyer, but in more recent times that has not been the case. The Commonwealth currently pays the subsidy in advance. Under the code the subsidy will be paid in arrears and the Commonwealth will make a one&amp;hyphen;off saving of some $4 million. The changes made pursuant to this legislation are very important. It is also important that the Westpac Bank has agreed that it will grant all existing loan borrowers the same rights, effectively, as will apply to new loan borrowers; that is, people will have the opportunity to have the daily balance method of interest calculation.
        </para>
        <break page="3482" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          During my years of legal practice I have had to review mortgages that people have previously entered into, and it has been a source of concern to me that at times these mortgages provided for interest to be paid not necessarily at monthly rests but at three&amp;hyphen;monthly rests or six&amp;hyphen;monthly rests and sometimes even at annual rests. That has meant, in many cases, that if a person is a day or two late in making a payment, another three, six or 12 months interest was paid to the mortgagee as a windfall.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I do not think that any reasonable person in a society could suggest that that was a reasonable situation. So I am very pleased that not only will new loan borrowers be protected by the Consumer Credit Code but also the Westpac Bank, while it was under no obligation to do so, has agreed—presumably in the interests of simplification but I hope also in the interests of equity and fairness—to extend this right of a daily balance method of interest calculation to existing borrowers.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is interesting that the amendments currently being proposed will postpone slightly the date by which this new method of calculating interest on loans will apply to existing borrowers. Originally the date when this was to happen was either the uniform Consumer Credit Code commencement date or 1 November 1996. This has now been extended to 1 June 1997. There obviously could be a small number of borrowers who might be adversely affected by the delay in this change, but I consider that the overwhelming benefit of helping all existing borrowers to have a daily form of calculation probably well and truly outweighs the minor inconvenience to some as a result of the delay in implementation of this very positive move.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I would like to commend not only the former government but also the current government and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) on supporting this legislation.

          Prior to resuming my seat, though, I would like to touch briefly on matters just mentioned in passing by the shadow minister when he referred to budget estimates. The shadow minister probably provided his own explanation of the varying amounts of money which will be made available in relation to certain expenditure of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The fact of the matter is that the minister has been able to go in there and has been able to fight on behalf of the veterans community and I think the veterans community by and large would be very pleased with what is included in the budget.

         <para first-indent="16">
          We, as a government, inherited a black hole of $10.3 thousand million—$10.3 billion—and clearly this government is determined that for the first time in 13 years there should be a return to responsible economic management. Thus the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the budget handed down in fact found savings of well over $7 billion. I think that the veterans community and we as members of parliament should be very pleased that the veterans budget has been kept largely intact.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Certainly, as the shadow minister mentioned, there has been a two per cent reduction, but then I understand that that reduction has been applied across the board. It should be appropriate for the Department of Veterans' Affairs to look very closely at its budget and, in doing so, it should ensure that there is no reduction in services of a substantial nature to the veterans community.

           —This is very positive legislation. As I indicated earlier, there are two arms to this bill—amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Both sides of politics agree with these amendments, which will ensure that, if a veteran has died from an injury or disease that has already been determined by the Repatriation Commission to be war caused, then the death will be taken to have been war caused also. Obviously, as I mentioned just a moment ago, the amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act will bring the benefits of the Consumer Credit Code not only to new borrowers under the defence service home loan arrangements but also to existing borrowers. I commend the bill to the Committee.

         —I also rise to support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) and, without wishing to be too repetitive, I intend to be equally brief. I support the bill on the same basis that it was supported by the previous speakers, notably the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). It was a fine piece of Labor reform to veterans' affairs legislation which was introduced by the former federal government in November of last year. The underlying thrust of the bill is to safeguard the interests of veterans and their families and to minimise any action needed to grant certain claims for pensions.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill does this by giving effect to two fundamental pieces of veterans' affairs legislation, one of which relates, as has been stated by previous speakers, to the amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918, which ensure that loan beneficiaries under this defence service homes scheme will have consumer rights similar, if not identical, to those of other borrowers. They will have those when all state and territory governments adopt the common Consumer Credit Code.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This amendment will also incorporate provisions of the code that are to be adopted by all state and territory governments throughout the course of this year and will give the defence service home beneficiaries rights under this code for matters not specified in the amending bill. Subsidised defence service home loans are available to veterans and other eligible people under a contractual arrangement, as has been alluded to by the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), between the Commonwealth and Westpac Banking Corporation. The bill identifies sections of that code that Westpac should not apply to such loans in order to preserve the scheme's benefits, and they are detailed in full in the bill.

          For example, one of those would include a veteran's age affecting his opportunity to get a loan elsewhere. That must be taken into account, for example, if and when the bank decides whether to provide the veteran with such a defence service home loan. As was put by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in his second reading speech, the concurrent operation of the Consumer Credit Code will not be limited, except for matters set out in the bill. This particular aspect of the legislation goes also to the question of interest charges on loans and, as has been quite clearly submitted to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that will be linked to daily balances instead of monthly balances.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In moving amongst members of the veterans community, I know that veterans fully support the concept of ongoing housing assistance. In a survey undertaken by the previous federal government throughout the course of last year, such assistance was rated particularly highly by all the veterans groups which were surveyed. I know that younger clients, and specifically serving members, were less likely at that time to rate the existing housing arrangements as good because it was their view that increased loan amounts and interest payment subsidies to veterans are the most important improvements. I urge the government to pursue those improvements as a matter of ongoing reform.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As put to me by veterans, subsidised loans for both home modification and rent assistance are currently important. They will, I am sure, remain important in the minds of veterans and perhaps become increasingly important over the course of the next five or 10 years, during which time subsidised loans—for example, for retirement village accommodation—and the extension of loans to cover other types of housing will also increase in importance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Equally briefly, the other aspect of veterans legislation to which this bill proposes amendment is that going to the issue of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, and it has been quite clearly put by both the member for Cunningham and the member for Fisher. The amendment to this legislation relates to the dependant of a veteran who dies from a war&amp;hyphen;caused disability becoming eligible for a pension without the need for the service relationship to be re&amp;hyphen;established. This, of course, will streamline the granting of a pension to a dependant of a veteran who dies from a war&amp;hyphen;caused injury or disease, and will eliminate the very time consuming and often stressful task of retracing a veteran's war service injury and illness in order to establish those links.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know that veterans are also very supportive of the pensions process operating under the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and they deem in general that it and the appeals process are fair. Some may consider from time to time that the appeals process is a little awkward to follow and perhaps difficult to understand—which may prevent some veterans from applying or from appealing against certain decisions. Once again, those veterans appeals processes may be a matter that the current federal government could undertake to investigate and assess. I know that those veterans who do apply, and who often subsequently submit appeals, do so on the basis that they may, for example, be motivated by more than one factor. While most veterans apply because of an increasing disability—and often the underlying basis of many appeals is that that disability is not recognised—another key motivation is a sense that they deserve and need more money to get by on.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, this piece of what is effectively Labor legislation is commended to the Committee on the basis that it is a necessary piece of reform. I congratulate both the much loved previous minister, Con Sciacca, and the current minister for proceeding to implement it. I know that, as I move about in the electorate of Isaacs, some of the clubs in that
         <break page="3485" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          electorate—including Mentone, Edithvale, Aspendale, Chelsea, Carrum and Cranbourne—provide a great service to veterans, young and old. It is on behalf of those veterans, members of those clubs—who fought so bravely in so many theatres of war around the world for the freedom of our great country, and with whom I recently remembered and commemorated the diggers who fought so heroically and so inspirationally 30 years ago during the tragic battle of Long Tan—that I support the bill. I know that those diggers would also urge me to support this bill. It is on that basis that I commend it to the Committee.

         —It is with pleasure that I speak in support of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1). I am sure its passage will be greeted with some relief by veterans throughout Australia. Schedule 1 of the bill ensures that there is greater equity for loan beneficiaries under the defence service homes scheme to have the same consumer rights as those enjoyed by the broader community. In the words of the explanatory memorandum to the legislation, `any potential conflict' between the Defence Services Homes Act 1918 and the consumer credit legislation will also be removed. With the agreement between the Commonwealth and the Westpac Banking Corporation, the bank will advance home loans to those deemed eligible under the Defence Services Homes Act 1918.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In a related development, all state and territory governments have agreed to enact legislation for a consumer credit code during 1996. This code applies to all credit provided in the course of business of a credit provider to a borrower who is an individual or strata corporation and if the credit is provided wholly or predominantly for personal, domestic or household purposes. The bill ensures that Westpac Banking Corporation's legal obligations under the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 largely comply with the requirements of the Consumer Credit Code.

       <para first-indent="16">
        These changes will come into effect from 1 November this year. After this time, people eligible for housing assistance under the defence services homes scheme will gain consumer rights comparable with those of other borrowers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Schedule 2 of the act is what I consider to be a very important piece of legislation that corrects some ambiguities of the 1986 Veterans' Entitlements Act. It will mean that the dependants of a veteran who has died from a disability already accepted as war&amp;hyphen;caused will be eligible for a pension without the relationship between the veteran's death and the war service having to be re&amp;hyphen;established. A claim for a pension by or for a dependant of a veteran who died from a war&amp;hyphen;caused injury or disease will be granted immediately, once the connection is identified, without reference to the statement of principles.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Because claims for dependant pensions have to be determined by the statement of principles and prepared by the repatriation medical authority, often with  additional investigation, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) has commented:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A veteran's death from a war&amp;hyphen;caused disability is now no guarantee that his or her dependants will have access to repatriation benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        He has also said that `this uncertainty is unacceptable' and that the changes brought about by this legislation `will reassure veterans and their families that financial support will continue to be available should a veteran die from a previously accepted, war&amp;hyphen;caused disability.' At a time of bereavement, obviously this will be a huge relief for the families involved.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The RSL has written to me stating that `this is a considerable win for the RSL and the veteran community.' As the RSL has also said, credit is due to Dr Allan Hawke, former secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and the former minister, Con Sciacca, who initiated this corrective action.

         I have had my attention drawn to a situation where the passing away of a veteran resulted in the war widows pension to the surviving dependant being held up and put in jeopardy until she submitted a new claim. This must have been a very stressful time for her. This legislation will ensure that such an unfortunate situation will not repeat itself.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As has already been said by other speakers in the Committee today, the veterans community is important to us. We were, of course, reminded of that very much last year during Australia Remembers. I do commend Con Sciacca, as others have done today, particularly for the part that he played in that commemoration. As the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) said, Con Sciacca did achieve a bipartisan approach. I found him to be a minister that one could approach in the corridor and say that some veteran needed some attention. He would say, `Put it in writing,' and the matter seemed to get fixed.

         So that was a good reminder last year. Last Sunday the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and I were at the same function where I was representing the minister—whom I am pleased to see has arrived in the Committee—at the unveiling and dedication of the Korea&amp;hyphen;South&amp;hyphen;East Asia memorial. Of course, that was a particularly important day for Vietnam veterans because the memorial was unveiled on the 30th anniversary of the battle of Long Tan when Australian soldiers displayed the same courage and heroism as others had displayed in previous wars.

That is doing something about the fact that there is no memorial to the ex&amp;hyphen;servicewomen in South Australia or certainly not in Adelaide. We are working on that now, Minister, not only with your cooperation, but with the cooperation of the state government and the Adelaide City Council. I think the veterans community enjoys bipartisan support. That is the way it should be. We all owe them a great deal. People from both sides of the chamber have taken part in this debate and I welcome the positive change it will bring to the lives of veterans and their families to whom this country owes a great debt.

        I would like to run through some of the issues that were raised during the debate, referring firstly to the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) and his contribution. Before dealing in detail with the contribution by the shadow minister, I would like to say that he accompanied me to Australia Remembers and Revisits
        <break page="3487" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Vietnam 30 Years On in Vietnam last week. He was certainly a valuable contributor to the commemoration program. I was pleased to see that the honourable member for Cunningham was able to be part of that very important and historic visit to Vietnam.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I will be presenting a report to the parliament in the next sitting on the visit to Vietnam, so I will not go into any great detail on that, but I thank the honourable member for Cunningham for his participation in what was indeed an historic and memorable commemoration in Vietnam.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The honourable member for Cunningham sought comments on budget items on page 3&amp;hyphen;126 with reference to the defence service home forward estimates jumping up and down. This really is quite normal under the circumstances and has quite a lot to do with the way the loans are now calculated. They used to be paid in advance and now will be paid in arrears. So that reflects the different method which this bill is going to allow to happen.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In some cases, also, loans are being paid out by veterans and obviously new ones are being taken out and changed around in that manner. That means that these payments will be reflected in the manner in which people are utilising the facility. I hope that gives the honourable member for Cunningham some understanding of why those figures do vary and are not consistent from year to year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The same applies to his second question relating to page 3&amp;hyphen;127, which refers to home acquisition assistance. There is obviously a flow&amp;hyphen;on effect from the way the interest subsidy used to be paid in advance and is now going to be in arrears. So there is a flow&amp;hyphen;on effect to that second question.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In terms of the decision to save two per cent across the board, the member for Cunningham asked whether it equalled a 10 per cent reduction in staffing and what impact it would have on veterans. I appreciate his comments in terms of the importance of the department's staff. I have certainly had—wherever I have been—wonderful support from the department's staff.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They do an excellent job and they are extremely well received by the veteran community, and that is a great credit to the department. Bureaucrats are often criticised by the general population. This is not the case with the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and I know that the veterans themselves have a very close association with the staff of the department.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Cunningham asked, `Does the decision to save two per cent across the board equate to a 10 per cent cut in staffing?' Well, whilst we are looking at doing things smarter and thinking smarter about the delivery of programs in the future, it is not all about cutting staff. It is certainly about cutting out unnecessary waste. It is also about improved technology, which can often lead to doing things better. It is often, in some cases, possible to buy a service rather than be a service deliverer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So, whilst the two per cent across&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;board savings are very important in terms of the context of the budget, there is not always a 10 per cent reduction in staff as the Community and Public Sector Union—I was thinking of that other group of unions that was bashing on the doors of Parliament House earlier this week—would have you believe. Let me assure the member for Cunningham that any savings are designed to create a more efficient department; they are not going to be at the expense of delivering the best possible service to the veterans to whom this nation owes a great debt of gratitude. It is a debt that I do not believe will ever adequately be repaid, but it is one that we must continue to honour. So let me assure the shadow minister of that.

         There is one little thing that I would say to the shadow minister—I see him walking into the Main Committee room. One of the things that I have been told by members of the veteran community is that they really do object to being referred to as `clients'. They really would like to be called `veterans' rather than `clients' and I am encouraging my department to use the word `veteran' rather than `client'. I know it is difficult at times. I know it is very difficult to describe people: are they `clients', `customers' or `veterans'? But it is one thing that I ask all members of parliament, on both sides, to look at where possible, as the use of `veteran' might be far more acceptable to this very deserving section of our Australian community.

         The member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) and the member for Cunningham both commended the previous minister on his work as Minister for Veterans' Affairs. On a number of occasions, when addressing ex&amp;hyphen;service organisations' annual meetings around this country, I have also commended the previous minister on the work he did in the portfolio. I will not go on any further now, but I thank them for those very sincere comments on the previous minister's work in this portfolio. They were reflected on both sides of the parliament. I think it reflects a genuine desire in the parliament to be as bipartisan as possible with the portfolio of Veterans' Affairs. That does not mean to say that we are not going to, from time to time, have some disagreement on issues. But I do note that both the member for Cunningham and the member for Fisher commended Con Sciacca on the work that he did in the portfolio.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, I want to acknowledge the work that all members in this House do for the veterans in their communities. I know that this nation is still in debt to the veterans, both young and old, for the manner in which they gave us this great freedom. This democracy we all enjoy came at a price. We must continue to support our veterans. I thank members on both sides of the House for their contributions.

       (1) and (2) Australia is able to grant extradition to countries to which the Extradition Act 1988 applies. Application of the Extradition Act to a country gives legal force in Australia to extradition arrangements concluded by Australia with another country. These arrangements are of different kinds, with bilateral treaties being only one example. Thus the Extradition Act may be applied to give effect to bilateral extradition treaties, various `less than treaty status' arrangements, British extradition treaties dating from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries inherited by Australia, and extradition obligations arising under multilateral conventions.

       Australia's extradition arrangements with Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam are governed by the Commonwealth Scheme for the Rendition of Fugitive Offenders, the London Scheme.

Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam are declared under the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Regulations to be extradition countries for the purposes of the Extradition Act. Australia's extradition laws were applied to Malaysia and Singapore on 1 May 1967 and to Brunei Darussalam on 3 May 1985.

       All extradition treaties and arrangements between Australia and other countries operate subject to Australia's Extradition Act 1988. The Extradition Act creates a mechanism for the processing of extradition requests in Australia. The Act sets out the matters that Australian courts have to consider before ruling on a person's eligibility for extradition. The Act also sets out the matters that the Attorney-General must consider in deciding whether a person is to be surrendered to another country. The Act contains all the internationally-accepted human rights safeguards that are now a part of modern extradition.

       (3) The question seeks information about extradition discussions initiated with other countries in the region. Extradition discussions with another country are aimed at establishing an extradition treaty with that country. It is not appropriate to disclose this due to the international practice that bilateral treaty negotiations are considered confidential between the parties until such time as a treaty is signed. This practice of not publicising bilateral treaty negotiations is recognised in the Government's recently announced policy on greater Parliamentary involvement in Australia's treaty&amp;hyphen;making processes.

        those having a religious basis to family law, view the Convention as inappropriate to their interests. Nevertheless, we have recently received indications that three of the countries listed above are positively disposed to the Convention and are likely to become parties once domestic legislation has been implemented, and others may become more disposed to the Convention if representations by posts are continued. The process of enactment of domestic legislation, followed in some cases by parliamentary approval of accession, may however cause further delays in those countries referred to above.

       The declaration made when Australia ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination was last considered in 1995. Withdrawal of the declaration is not possible at this stage. Article 4 (a) of the Convention contemplates the enactment of criminal offences for racial hatred and incitement to racial discrimination.

       The question of withdrawing or modifying the reservations made when Australia ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is considered every year when Australia's National Action Plan on human rights is updated. Paragraph (c) of the National Action Plan requires Australia to indicate human rights treaty reservations we intend to remove. In relation to the reservation to Articles 10 (2) and (3) of the Covenant, due to Australia's demographic and geographical features it is difficult to achieve the total segregration of accused and convicted prisoners, and children or juvenile prisoners from adult prisoners. Furthermore the Australian Government remains convinced that it is appropriate to allow the responsible authorities discretion to determine whether it is beneficial for a child or juvenile to be imprisoned with adults. However the Government is committed to achieving the goal of separation of accused and convicted prisoners. Given the above, there are no present intentions to withdraw or modify Australia's reservations.

       (1) Costs under the ANSTO contract with UKAEA Dounreay cover the spent fuel reprocessing, uranium recovery, cemented waste storage and a range of associated activities, and will total around $5.9 million. Further costs of $920,000 were incurred for the shipment, including ship hire and the use of State personnel. These costings are the best estimate available at this time given that many of the incoming bills involve payment in a foreign currency and are dependent on the exchange rate at the date of payment.

In the Public Environment Report, released in October 1995, ANSTO proposed the transfer of an initial shipment of spent nuclear fuel rods around June 1996. In early 1996, the UK authorities advised ANSTO that they required the proposed shipment to be sent as soon as possible for it to be included in their current reprocessing program. The shipment of 114 fuel rods left Sydney on 19 April 1996 and docked in Scotland on 16 June 1996.

      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (1) The Budget which we will deliver on 20 August will contain measures to bring the Budget back into balance over the next three years. The Government is not prepared to speculate about budget measures or their possible impact on staffing numbers and related savings.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (2) The answer to the honourable member's question is based on data from the Department of Finance, sourced from the Continuous Record of Personnel (CRP) as at December 1995, which is the most recent data available. The CRP data is derived from pay centre data which does not always reflect the actual work locations of APS employees. For example, some agencies pay state-based staff from an ACT pay centre, leading to an incorrect count of staff in different areas and a higher percentage of APS employees being counted against the ACT than is the case.
