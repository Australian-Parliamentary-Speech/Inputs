        The motion will be seconded by the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson). The motion on Cyprus I have just placed before the House this morning is a matter of considerable interest to all members. Last week the President of Cyprus, Mr Clerides, visited Australia and met with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) here in Canberra and with a number of ministers and members of both sides of the House in Sydney and Melbourne. I was very pleased to have the opportunity to talk with Mr Clerides and hear his views about the continuing problems in Cyprus 21 years after the invasion by Turkey in 1974.

         For the last 20 years I have taken a keen interest in a just resolution for the people of Cyprus and their struggle against the Turkish invaders. For Australia, Cyprus is not just a small island in the eastern Mediterranean; it is also the ancestral home of some 50,000 to 60,000 Cypriot Australians. As members may be aware, the Cypriot Australian community is the second largest Cypriot community outside of Cyprus itself.

         President Clerides's visit was an occasion for him to appraise the Cypriot community in Australia, and the wider community, of the current situation in Cyprus, particularly his proposal for demilitarisation of the island under the auspices of the UN. It was also an occasion to highlight the Cypriot problem in the Australian press. This is an issue in which Australia should not only be taking an interest but also leading the way because we have a unique knowledge of both communities, and also because time is running out.

         The world has ignored the calamity on Cyprus for too long. Old conflicts such as the Cold War and new conflicts such as the Gulf War and then Bosnia have distracted the attention of the United States and Europe. Some might say it was convenient for the United States to be so distracted, because of the strategic value of Turkey on the southern flank of the old Eastern bloc and as a staging post during the Gulf War.

         Over the last few years, particularly since the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the former Soviet Union, one would have thought there would have been greater international interest in dealing with the injustice on the island of Cyprus. If the Europeans and the Americans have forgotten Cyprus, Australia should not.

         It is my intention in the House today, in proposing this motion, to draw attention to the issue of Cyprus—to put it on the agenda for the Australian Parliament, and to have our government continue the fight for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus as the only legitimate authority on the island. After 21 years, it is time for the withdrawal of all foreign troops. It is time for a lasting political settlement. It is also time that Cyprus was ruled by Cypriots, for Cypriots. The Cypriot issue is the longest running sore in Europe. It is an absolute disgrace that the international community have allowed Turkey to occupy over a third of Cyprus for 21 years.

         Members would recall that in 1974, after a coup deposed the Makarios government, Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus above the so-called `Attila' or `Green' Line, running from Morphou to Famagusta. A puppet government was established, declaring itself to be the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus, which was recognised only by Turkey. In 1983, the TFSC unilaterally declared independence as the TRNC, or Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, but again was only recognised by Turkey and the declaration was condemned by the United Nations.

         Greek Cypriots were expelled to the south of Cyprus by the Turkish occupiers in the north. Over 150,000 Cypriots became refugees in their own country. Turkey then set about repopulating the north with people from Annatolia. An estimated 70,000 settlers were imported from Turkey to colonise the north, while it seems that 45,000 Turkish Cypriots have left the island. Over 1,600 people are considered to be `missing persons'. Over 35,000 Turkish troops are stationed in Cyprus. They are the statistics, and they are astounding for a nation the size of Cyprus with a population of around 730,000 people.

         Since 1968 successive UN Secretaries-General have been involved in convening intercommunal talks to find a solution. A so-called `set of ideas' was developed as a blueprint in 1992. The set of ideas suggests a framework for an agreement between the two communities. The constitution of Cyprus would be amended to provide for a bicommunal and bizonal federation.

         President Clerides, in 1993 and again in 1994, wrote to the UN Secretary-General proposing a negotiated settlement through demilitarisation but, due it seems to a lack of political will on the Turkish Cypriot side, there has been no progress in achieving this. In fact, a report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council in June this year noted `the excessive level of armaments and forces in Cyprus and the rate at which they are being strengthened are a cause of serious concern.' The Secretary-General went on to note `the lack of progress towards a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus' and called for a withdrawal of non-Cypriot forces, as described in the set of ideas. The same report noted that Cyprus is probably the most heavily militarised part of Europe. For a small country it is a disgraceful circumstance.

CHOGM also expressed full support for President Clerides's proposal for demilitarisation and called for the speedy withdrawal of Turkish forces and settlers, as well as the return of refugees and an accounting for missing persons.

         Last Wednesday, 15 November, was the 12th anniversary of the setting up of the rogue state of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The thin green line separating the north and south of the island is a very real dividing line. People have been forced out of their homes, and are not allowed to return. One of the saddest things about the occupation by Turkish troops in the north is the number of Turkish Cypriots who have now left the island. The Turkish Cypriot population on the island is probably the lowest it has ever been in the history of the Turkish people on the island.

         The city of Famagusta, one of the jewels in the Mediterranean, is deserted. Famagusta is a metaphor for this whole sorry issue. Founded in ancient times, it has seen many invasions and it has survived. But now it is barren and empty, like the resolve of Turkey to come to the table on this dispute. To stand on the hillside overlooking this ancient city and see it windswept and deserted overwhelms you with a great sense of sadness. Under Turkish control this jewel of the Mediterranean has gone to rack and ruin. That is something that anyone who goes to see that part of the world can only be saddened by. The emptiness of Famagusta contrasts markedly with the economic prosperity in the southern part of the island.

         A particular concern of mine for some time has been for Australians of Greek Cypriot origin who lost their property in northern Cyprus after the Turkish invasion in 1974. Last year in this House, I raised the question of these people's rights. The answer was that the Turkish Cypriot administration would accept property claims from third party states but not from people of Greek or Greek Cypriot origin. These people are Australian citizens, and they were citizens of this country prior to the invasion in 1974. They have made a claim as Australian citizens but have been rejected by the Turkish authorities. This is a disgraceful expropriation of their property.

         It is interesting to note that, after the Turkish invasion in 1974, people with Anglo-Saxon names who were British or American passport holders at the time of the invasion were not treated in the same cavalier manner. It was only if your name was a Greek name that you lost your property. My family came to this country three generations ago from Ireland. It would be the same as the British authorities in Northern Ireland, from where my grandfather came, saying that I could not inherit any property there because my name was Irish. It is just a disgraceful set of circumstances that no-one is willing to address. It should be addressed urgently.

         If the Turkish government wants to show some form of reasonableness in this issue, it should restore the property of these Australian citizens as a show of good faith to this country, which has provided a home to many people who have come here from Turkey. A small thing such as that—for the Turkish authorities, it is only a small thing—would be a very important part of these confidence building measures.

The Australian government has not sat on its hands, but we need to continue to press the case for Cyprus internationally.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, everyone thought that the world could turn its eyes to resolving some of these other ongoing issues, thus placing Cyprus high on the international agenda. Unfortunately, it nearly gets there, and then something else comes along to take it off the agenda. There is now a window of opportunity for the world to solve the injustice in Cyprus. It would be irresponsible and immoral for us to ignore the situation in Cyprus by leaving it to the slow processes of the UN to resolve.

Not only does one need to look at the current situation, which the gentleman expressed and described so accurately, but one also has to ask why this problem has been around for so long and why there is so much intransigence.

         As with so many of these international difficulties, whether it is Northern Ireland, Bosnia, or whatever, the history goes back a long way. The underlying reason why these situations do not get resolved is probably the fundamental lack of trust, often based on good reason on both sides, which means that people cannot come to the table and resolve the problem.

         Cyprus has a history of conquest and minority groups. Throughout the ages it has been a staging post in the centre of the Mediterranean. In fact, I stood in Famagusta when it was a thriving and prosperous city. If you look at Famagusta today and compare it to when I saw it 25 years ago or more, there is no question that it is an unsatisfactory and unacceptable situation. I agree with the honourable gentleman: we have to take every possible step to resolve those sorts of situations.

         My experience in Cyprus is not as current as that of the previous speaker. I lived in Cyprus for three years from 1968 to 1971. I was there as a member of the British air force—this was after the island had independence; as we all know, Britain retained some small territorial land there as sovereign territory—and worked at Episkopi but in fact lived in Limassol, which was in the republic. I travelled extensively through the island.

         Although the military action from Turkey had not taken place then, there were two clear parts of the island. You went across the green line to go from the Turkish part to the Greek part and vice versa. There were armed incidents on a regular basis, but this was before the major Turkish military action. Therefore, if you like, it was one of the better times in recent Cypriot history.

         Not only did I have the chance to travel and work there but I also had the opportunity to mix socially with Cypriots—I went to their weddings and I had Cypriots of both Greek and Turkish background working for me. At that stage, it seemed that there were an awful lot of problems that were going to take a long time to resolve because of the background.

         There have been many changes since, and I am told by a number of friends and colleagues who still maintain regular contacts and who have travelled there that I probably would not recognise much of the Cyprus that I knew. Particularly in the Limassol area, as I understand it, the economic development has been phenomenal. In Paphos, which was a little country town, you went to a restaurant to look at the pelicans. It was a quaint place, and I understand it is almost unrecognisable in terms of its development and so on.

         I acknowledge that I have not had recent contact with Cyprus, but it is important to understand that the background of this problem has its genesis from the days when I was in Cyprus and before. The problem very largely came to the fore after independence. When the island was divided in 1974, it was specifically triggered by the Greek directed coup d'etat. We now have this north-south divide, this Turkish-Greek divide. In 1983, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was proclaimed. Of course, that is recognised only by Turkey. It is appropriate that we do not recognise that.

         As I understand it, both halves of Cyprus operate under a democratic process, although they have slightly different structures, and both function as free economies. But the Greek Cypriots undoubtedly are more successful. The Turkish part of the island relies very heavily on Turkey. It is important for anybody who has not been to Cyprus to understand that roughly 78 per cent of the population is Greek Cypriot and 18 per cent is Turkish Cypriot.

          On the whole, things were fairly harmonious until about 1959 when British independence was achieved. In fact, there have been peacekeepers there since 1964. The United Nations Secretary-General, whoever it has happened to be, has been working pretty hard to resolve this problem on an ongoing basis, particularly since 1968.

        Originally, both communities of Turkey and Greece signed off on that principle some years ago, but recently it would be fair to say that the Turkish and the Turkish Cypriot communities have been moving increasingly to a position of looking for two sovereign states. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said fairly recently with some exasperation and frustration that he felt the Turkish Cypriots had shown a lack of cooperation and goodwill in resolving the problem.

         That problem had its generation a long time ago and has gone through several generations of people. It is based on issues that may seem remote to us today but which were very real to those who lived on the island. The situation was the same as that in Northern Ireland, where in my view one community which was in the majority treated the minority community as second-class citizens until that minority felt that it had no option but to resort to arms. I do not condone what the IRA has done, but what I am saying is that there were reasons why that pressure was applied.

         When I was in Cyprus and before, there was no question that those of the Turkish minority were treated in very many respects as second-class citizens. I remember talking to one of the leading Turkish Cypriots of the day when there had been a number of historical incidents. He said, `The next time there's a problem, we will go all the way; I would rather die than have this situation continue.' The reality was that it was manifest in all sorts of ways. The reality was that, if  you were a Turkish Cypriot, you were not allowed to build a house other than with mud bricks. As is the case in our country with Aboriginal people, there were little discriminations, little pinpricks, that daily caused the irritations.

         Very early on there was very significant Greek military power and the Turks felt threatened in the same way that today there is very substantial Turkish military power and the Greeks feel threatened. Today, one of the problems is that the Turkish side holds a larger percentage of the land than the population can possibly justify. There is the problem of refugees who have been driven out of the north and want to go back and there are issues of compensation, which the member from Watson so graphically described. There is the problem of European Union membership. Turkey, Greece and Cyprus itself are looking to attain European Union membership.

         It is very interesting that, whilst we condemn the idea of incorporation of part of Cyprus into mainland Turkey, which has certainly been on the agenda of some on the Turkish side, part of the agenda in my time there was enosis on the Greek side, which talked about incorporation of part or the whole of Cyprus into Greece. It is not just that today the Turks want to incorporate part of the island into mainland Turkey. Twenty-five years ago, frankly, the boot was on the other foot. It is because of that history that many of the Turks today feel threatened by some of the moves that are made, even if they are made in good faith.

The Greeks fear confederation of part of Cyprus with Turkey because they feel they will then be swamped. It is all about each side having a fear of being swamped by the other side.

         This requires the abolition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the end of the Greek desire for enosis. If Cyprus is to be viable, the two communities must look to each other and their common island and not to their pasts across the sea. This will be difficult because it is easier to love one's own family than to learn to love the stranger. Yet, if this is not done, Cyprus will have no future.

         The good news is that it actually can be done, and in Australia it has been done. The Australian government should not ignore our successful integration of formerly warring Greeks and Turks who have now become cooperative Australians. This transformation can be effective in Cyprus with goodwill and a genuine desire for peace. Recently, the President of Cyprus was in Australia. He received a big welcome and impressed everyone who met him. I was certainly impressed by him, especially by his evident desire for a true peace between the two communities on Cyprus.

         I am convinced that the opportunity now exists for a proper settlement of this problem on Cyprus. Recently, the Israelis and the Palestinians have begun to settle their problems. Now the Bosnians, the Serbs and the Croats are agreeing to settle their problems. In these circumstances, who can sensibly say that Cyprus is beyond solution? Each side of this dispute now has a very big burden to shoulder. Both sides must purge themselves from old hatreds and point scoring. They must learn to love the future, not the past. They must be motivated for the common good and not for their own factional good. This is a tall order for groups who are not normally inclined to compromise and cooperate.

         When we look at how this particular tragedy in Cyprus has unfolded, it essentially represents another use of naked power in aggression from one people against another. There is absolutely no excuse for the occupation of part of the island of Cyprus—part of the republic of Cyprus's sovereign territory—by the troops of another nation. Quite clearly, there is no excuse for the petition and the 21 years of scandal, in the sense of the lack of action on the part of the United Nations and, I might add, more recently on the part of the Commonwealth heads of government, notwithstanding their most recent statements.

         Bosnia has been mentioned as, I suppose, a correlation with the continuing tragedy in Cyprus. It is interesting to note that, in an article that I found during the debates and matters arising from the Bosnian crisis, a Serb spokesman said, `Well, the Turks have managed to get away with this in Cyprus for 20 years. Why shouldn't we?' That particular attitude is a significant one, because it reflects the type of results that you get when the institutions that are designed to ensure world peace and to oppose aggression, occupation and military domination fail in their objectives. Bosnia was a failure, but Cyprus has been a failure for 21 years. Bosnia was a failure for almost four years, but now we are, hopefully, at the dawn of a peaceful settlement.

         Cyprus still remains one of the great unresolved tragedies of Europe. Cyprus is an island in the Mediterranean Sea, but it is part of Europe. It has been culturally part of Europe since ancient times. There is no doubt, when we look at the recent history of Europe and the so-called sophistication of political developments in Europe—particularly the creation of the European Union and the greater integration of the nations of Europe within the European Union—that Cyprus is one of those remaining problems, remaining crises and remaining dilemmas that requires a solution as soon as possible in order to show that we do not and will not tolerate this type of militarist occupation. It is an illegal separation that is unrecognised and is intolerable under international law but remains in place. In other words, it is a defacto division of a sovereign nation through military aggression.

        That is a fine statement but, in relation to the Commonwealth, Cyprus has been one of the undying sources of discomfort because the Commonwealth has failed miserably to resolve the problems in Cyprus. In the first instance, as Cyprus was formerly a British colony, the Commonwealth had a responsibility to look at the problems in Cyprus. In particular, since 1974 the Commonwealth had a responsibility to take a far more resolute stand in opposing the occupation and separation of the island.

         The recent history of the island has been dominated by the division of the island since the Turkish military intervention in 1974. Since 1974 the southern part of the island has been under the territorial control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. The northern part is ruled by an autonomous Turkish Cypriot administration supported by the presence of Turkish troops. In 1983 that administration proclaimed itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus—TRNC—which is recognised only by Turkey.

         The other aspect of this tragedy that deserves discussion is the retardation of the economic prosperity of the island by occupation. It is clear from the statistics that if you compare the two sections of the islands—the occupied section and that which is controlled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus—you find there is a yawning chasm of economic development or differences between the two. At present the Republic of Cyprus is endeavouring to enter the European Union to be able to provide for its citizens a continuing increase in the standard of living and to be able to participate fully in the economic activity and the economic operations in Europe. Yet because of the occupation this process is being thwarted.

         The Republic of Cyprus has an average per capita income of more than $US11,000 and has had that for more than two years. Unemployment is running at below two per cent and it has a positive growth rate. Through this economic prosperity it has made itself eligible for membership of the European Union. Some 200,000 Greek Cypriots who formerly resided in the north—one-third of the Greek Cypriot population—have flooded into the south. In the section that is under occupation, the per capita income of its citizens is less than one-third of the per capita income of those who reside in the area that is administered by the government of the Republic of Cyprus.

         It is quite clear from the economic statistics—and these are not statistics brandished by the government as some sort of propaganda exercise; they are statistics from reputable sources—that one section is going into decline, and that is the northern section occupied by Turkish troops, and the southern section is buoyant and increasing in economic prosperity and obviously improving the standard of living of its citizens. In another sense, there is an added human rights tragedy here in that those people who reside under the occupation are being deprived of the benefits of economic prosperity and development. Apart from anything else that we can urge as Australians who value economic prosperity and the right to be able to live, work and enjoy the proceeds of a higher standard of living, this must be one of our central core objectives.

         Finally, I want to dwell on section 3 of the honourable member's motion, which applauds the contribution of Australian peacekeepers since 1964 in maintaining order and stability on the island. Australia has made a very significant contribution in an extraordinarily difficult situation. For 30 years Australian police have been a familiar sight in Cyprus. Prime Minister Menzies sent the first 40 Australian police to Cyprus in 1964. Former colleagues of mine in the Western Australian police force served in Cyprus. They served well the interests of their country and the interests of peace and trying to find a solution. It is interesting to note the ability of the Australian police to deal with the two sides in this equation. Many of the Greek Cypriots have relatives in Australia, so many of them have that sentimental and familiar contact with Australia. The Australian police are able to deal as fair traders with the Greek Cypriots. The Turkish people respect Australia's contribution, perhaps our bravery and our efforts at Gallipoli, and the reputation Australians have for being people of honour and courage. So both sides respect the contribution made by the Australian police contingent to Cyprus.

         —It is with pleasure that I stand to support the motion moved by the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay). I express my appreciation to him for bringing it forward. It is a detailed motion which covers very well the complexity and the breadth and depth of the Cyprus issue. It also proposes some constructive and positive initiatives. The cultural/religious/political clash or, if you like, the boundary dispute between the Turkish and European empires has gone on now for many centuries. The movement of Turks into Europe, the invasion of Europe by Turks and by the eastern cultures, goes back many centuries. We have seen edges and points of friction that have lasted now for many years. We are watching one of those being played out and replayed in the Balkans. In that context the role of Europe in and through Cyprus dates back to the earliest invasions and also was caught up heavily in the crusades, which are very much part of British history. Cyprus was a staging post and a key strategic centre for the Knights of St George and the various other crusaders who were involved in that struggle.

         Amongst the complexity of that conflict, Cyprus was a relatively minor issue. When one looks at the Middle East and the Jewish and Palestinian question and at the three-way clash in the Balkans, then Cyprus was always pushed into the background. In that context, the tragedy that developed with the Cold War meant that Cyprus became a part of yet another battle. So what had been the battle front of Islam versus Christianity, of East versus West, of the Turkish empire and the European continent became refocused to NATO versus the Eastern bloc. The importance of the Bosporus and the Black Sea became fundamental.

In a sense it is unfortunate that, opportunistically, the major powers have allowed this to occur.

         The fact that the so-called Republic of Northern Cyprus is recognised only by Turkey is indicative that the world does not agree with the situation there. It does not accept the Turkish forces' occupation of northern Cyprus and does not accept the settlement of Turkish citizens into Cyprus. Yet nothing seems to happen. One has to start wondering why that is. The answer becomes clear that in the international power plays that go on it was of more benefit to the West to allow Cyprus to be the centre of that kind of activity rather than to risk the withdrawal of Turkey from NATO and, hence, for the West to have no control over the Bosporus and the Black Sea, which was critical.

         I had the privilege in 1990 of representing this parliament as a sole representative at an IPU conference in Cyprus. Being in Cyprus, it was not surprising that there was some discussion about all this. The conference, amongst its other matters, decided to deal with the Mediterranean as an issue of special business. At that conference I moved an amendment to the motion that was being dealt with, an amendment along the lines of calling for the withdrawal of Turkish forces from Cyprus. That amendment was debated both in committee and in the plenary session. It was interesting to watch that debate and to watch which representatives disagreed with that concept whilst their own governments were notionally supporting that principle in the United Nations.

         The position of Cyprus has remained the same. In effect, the rest of the world's problems have subsided and the Cyprus question has now become paramount. A world that cannot solve a problem like that of Cyprus is not facing up to its issues. There is no justification whatsoever for the occupation of northern Cyprus by Turkish forces and there is no justification whatsoever for the settlement into Cyprus of citizens of Turkey. The Turkish Cypriots have a culture of their own. It is a Cypriot culture. The Greek Cypriots have their own culture. It is endemic and natural to them. I have no doubt that if it was not for the efforts of mainland Turkey there would not be an issue on Cyprus. I have no doubt that the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots are more than able to resolve their questions. In fact, we thought they had; and so did the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

         We thought that resolutions were being achieved. It was therefore really quite puzzling to find that Turkey seemed not to be willing to go ahead.

One wonders at times who is in control of Turkey and whether the Turkish military are prepared to allow the Cypriot question to be resolved. One wonders whether the Turkish military see a resolution of the Cyprus question as being a lessening of their influence in that country and whether that may change the focus on the Kurdish issue. What the world sees as a question within Cyprus may be a much more serious question within Turkey itself and where it is going. That is quite disturbing.

While ever the Turkish military are part of the Western bloc and NATO and are supported by the military of the Western world, that gives them both credibility and influence. I suspect that a resolution will not be achieved until we recognise that point, start talking about it and face it.

         The tragedy of Cyprus, the dispossessed people, the refugees, those who are missing and the tens of thousands of people in Australia of Cypriot origin does not need all that much retelling. We are all conscious of it. It is one issue that both sides of the House strongly agree on. We need to talk more about the desecration of cultural icons and monuments in northern Cyprus. We need to talk more about the treatment of some of the property that is still owned by non-residents of that partitioned country. We need to start talking much more about the human rights and the downstream rights of successive generations.

         I do not know how we will persuade the Turkish military and government to accept the logic and fairness of the withdrawal of their troops. Settling mainland Turkish people into Cyprus is not in the interests of Turkish Cypriots or anybody else or even of those settlers. Given that there have been decades of agreement in the world about the issue, it is hard to envisage how we will now deal with it, unless we upscale our language and understanding of it. Perhaps we have been too gentle and kind. Perhaps we have been too sensitive to those people in Australia of Turkish origin that we wish to respect and treat as Australians. We need to particularly focus on the real architect of the issue. I am now quite convinced that it is the Turkish military.

         The real tragedy was that, in 1990 when I was in Cyprus moving an amendment calling for the withdrawal of Turkish troops, Australia and Turkey had celebrated the 75th anniversary of Gallipoli just a few weeks earlier. Seventy-five years after that great tragedy and those great acts of heroism by both Turkish and Australian soldiers, that incredibly unusual bond between these two countries was being torn apart by their differences over a small and innocent country that had also been torn apart. It is indicative that our parliamentarians, our military and our representatives were visiting Turkey to celebrate the 75th anniversary but at the same time were arguing about the removal of Turkish forces from Cyprus.

         The proposal by the United States Congress, item 8 of the motion, `ultimate total demilitarisation of the Republic of Cyprus', is probably the best answer. The proposals for federation may be the most practical solution, but the fact is that the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots are both politically astute and very dedicated to that island and that island nation. I have no doubt that they are more than able to find a resolution. They need the will of the world behind them to call for the effective withdrawal of all forces and to assist in the resolution.

It has been a history of suffering and violation and its capacity to generate a further outbreak of violence has not been diminished. If such an outbreak were to occur, it would have a great potential to spread beyond the island itself and exacerbate the tensions between Greece and Turkey.

         The tragedy of Cyprus is not just a matter of international politics; it deeply involves an important component of the Australian population. Today, there are an estimated 50,000 Australians who trace their origins to Cyprus. Australia's multicultural society embraces the second largest Cypriot community outside the Republic of Cyprus itself. Of these, 40,000 are of Greek descent and 10,000 are of Turkish descent. It is important to register that Australians of Cypriot origin of both backgrounds have worked together harmoniously in Australia and made significant contributions to Australian society. They must all feel very deeply the wounds inflicted on their country of origin.

         It is fundamental that Turkey withdraw the 35,000 troops from the Turkish mainland that occupy the northern zone. The troops from Turkey are occupying Cyprus against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the population and the universal opinion of the international community. An act of force does not become acceptable merely because it is protracted. The United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his report to the UN Security Council in June, described the northern zone in Cyprus as `one of the most highly militarised areas in the world'. He emphasised that in the course of this year there has been a major upgrading of Turkish tanks, anti-aircraft weapons and howitzers.

         Military build-ups of this sort are antithetical to any genuine move for a resolution of differences. They contain within themselves the potential for an outbreak of armed conflict. They create counter-forces and arms races which exacerbate the sense of mutual distrust and antagonism. As the motion outlines, there are strong arguments for a total demilitarisation of the Republic of Cyprus. This would meet the security concerns of all the parties involved and would enhance the prospects for a peaceful and lasting resolution of the Cyprus dispute. It strikes me as being merely commonsense that, if any security guarantees are necessary, they should be supplied by international forces under the aegis of the United Nations.

In resolution 541 of 1983, the UN Security Council deplores the declaration of the Turkish Cypriot authorities of the purported secession of part of the Republic of Cyprus.

What I do find surprising coming from someone as vigorous and forthright as the member for Watson is that his usual straightforwardness and robustness—something that was forthcoming in his speech—was not actually manifest in the components of the motion itself. Perhaps the honourable member is stepping back from the past and trying to be a diplomat, but I should say that stepping out of character does not entirely suit him. In fairness to the honourable member, I should say that this was not characteristic in his speech, but the motion studiously avoids mentioning who has done what to whom.

         The plain fact that is not stated in the motion is that the onus does lie with the Turkish government. The Turkish government is the government that occupies Cyprus. The Turkish government is the government that has systematically acted in breach of United Nations resolutions. The Turkish government is the government that is building up foreign forces in Cyprus. The Turkish government is the government trying to assimilate the northern zone to the Turkish mainland and the Turkish government is the government that is denying return rights to 160,000 Greek Cypriots.

         It is undoubtedly true, as the motion states, that there is a need for all parties involved in the Cyprus question to demonstrate goodwill and a new resolve to work actively towards a lasting, peaceful political settlement. What also needs to be said, however, is that, while there are always rights and wrongs and always pre-existing tensions, irritations and triggers in every conflict, in truth and in justice, the history of Cyprus demonstrates to any reasonable person that the party on whom the overwhelming onus lies to work actively towards a lasting and peaceful political settlement and to demonstrate goodwill and a new resolve is the Turkish government. Not to recognise this is, I believe, an affront to the facts and a misplaced attempt at diplomatic politeness that threatens to defeat and undermine the purpose of the exercise.

         As already canvassed, the Republic of Cyprus first achieved its independence in 1960 from Britain after four or five years of both guerilla warfare and a campaign for independence, and also substantial debate and difficulties between the communities of Turkish and Greek origin on Cyprus about a constitution.

         It is interesting to note some of the elements of the original constitution of Cyprus which indicate the extent to which the two communities then were able to resolve their differences in order to establish a single political entity. Both the Greek and Turkish tongues were recognised in the constitution; it was provided that there be a flag of neutral design reflecting neither Greek nor Turkish origins; both communities had the right to celebrate the various national holidays of their parent communities; specific positions were accorded to the different communities in the political structure; the public service was specified to be composed of 70 per cent Greek origin and 30 per cent Turkish origin; the army was specified to have 60 per cent Greek origin and 40 per cent Turkish origin; and even the security forces and the police had similar arrangements.

         At that time the two communities, in spite of the background of achieving independence through guerilla warfare and some conflict, were able to resolve the difficulties and establish a basis for common operation.

The situation then unfolded, of course, whereby the Turkish invasion occurred and there was the establishment first of the federated state of Cyprus, not recognised by anybody other than the Turkish government, and then subsequently in 1983 the establishment of the self-styled Turkish Republic of North Cyprus, which occupies approximately 37 per cent of the area of Cyprus and includes within it about 180,000 people, of whom now only about 500 people are of Greek origin.

It could be, perhaps, broadly similar to the original arrangement that was introduced which does give reasonable recognition to the rights of the minority Turkish population but does not give them a veto or control over the entire affairs of the island.

         Recent developments have been of some significance in the dispute with respect to the future of Cyprus. The structure of so-called confidence building measures that were initially developed several years ago has waxed and waned as numerous attempts have been made to produce a resolution of the dispute through the offices of both the United Nations Secretary-General and the United States.

         A number of fairly minor concessions have been made by the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in recent times. In July 1994, the European Court of Justice in effect banned imports to the European Union from the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus because it did not recognise any form of health certificates that were provided other than those from the Republic of Cyprus. As a result of this, the line of the northern government, led by Mr Denktash, hardened significantly, and for a period there was an apparent rejection of the proposed bicommunal, bizonal federal solution. Part of the response from the Turks was to negotiate a bilateral foreign affairs and defence agreement with the Republic of Turkey.

         In October 1994, President Clerides of the Republic of Cyprus in direct discussions with the Turkish Cypriots offered to recognise some form of partial sovereignty for the Turkish Cypriot community in return for Turkish Cypriot support for Cyprus entering the European Union. I recently participated with other delegates in a trip to the European institutions and this issue was one of a number that we discussed with people in the European institutions. It is quite clear that Cyprus is well on the way to admission to the European Union.

Although most of the recent publicity in Australia on issues relating to the Greek community has tended to focus on Macedonia, he said that we should be wary of neglecting the importance of the Cyprus issue just because it has been a longstanding and ongoing issue.

         —The spread of those with associations with Cyprus through the Australian community has been quite remarkable. Although this motion has been moved by a city member, the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), throughout every country area of Australia—in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, as in mine—there are many who have their origins in the villages of Cyprus. Although Cyprus is a long way from us, the impact of the unfortunate continued conflict between the Turkish and Greek population there has an undoubted impact here in Australia. Very strong feelings are held, and there have been some very significant rallies and demonstrations around the point of view of the two opposing sides.

         I guess there are three things that I want to say about the general context of the situation and the reason that I support this motion. Indeed, I commend the Chief Government Whip for introducing it. The first is that it is very hard for a country like Australia so far away to resolve the differences that exist between the people of Cyprus. It is, of course, ultimately for them. We look towards the people within Cyprus being able to resolve their problems amicably, democratically and in a way that avoids conflict.

         Australia's commitments since 1964 of police detachments gives us a somewhat different perspective in one way from others. I think the way in which successive Australian police detachments have performed on that troubled island has been remarkable. They have come not just from the Australian Federal Police; they have come from the police forces around the Commonwealth. Having met numbers of them, both before their departure and after their return, I think Australia can be very proud both individually and collectively of the role that the police detachments have played.

         While Australia has this long-term commitment to peace in Cyprus, it does concern me that today there still seems to be so little progress towards final achievement. I have been one of those who has felt long since that it is probably more within the bailiwick of the European Union than anybody else that a resolution can be found; yet we saw in the outbreak of hostilities in the former Yugoslavia how inept and incompetent the Europeans were in anything that is within their own bailiwick.

         It is interesting that, since early this year, there have been discussions with Greece and Turkey to establish an EU Turkey customs union and to make sure that, as part of that, there is a timetable for future membership of the European Union for Cyprus. The establishment of a separate community in north Cyprus, and its maintenance by virtue of the military presence of the Turks, makes it absolutely critical that both the countries on the European mainland—Greece and Turkey—come to a rational agreement on the customs union that admits Turkey, as much as they make a decision regarding Cyprus.

         It is important that Cyprus has the capacity to become an independent member of the European Union. Hopefully, that may lead to an independent Cyprus without the military presence that has caused Cyprus so much anxiety and so much fear for future peace in the island. That is part of the thinking behind this motion. Paragraph 8 of the motion agrees with the United States Congress resolution calling for the total demilitarisation of Cyprus. That seems to be the way in which the Australian government should approach the subject. If the island were to be totally demilitarised it would not prejudice any separate entity that might be determined by the parties on the island.

         If the people of north Cyprus wish to retain a separate state, as they have at the moment, there is no reason why they cannot do so.

Hopefully, the rights of the minority Turkish population can be guaranteed by arrangements which avoid the presence of some sort of military deterrent. There is no doubt that if the island could be totally demilitarised the threat of significant military forces, which the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) mentioned, would be reduced.

         There are two other areas where action can follow. The European Union has the capacity to apply pressure to its members. I do not believe that the European Union can justly claim to have a responsible role in world affairs if it cannot attend to its own affairs. The divisions between various ethnic groups in the former Yugoslavia should not have been insurmountable if goodwill had prevailed and if discussions, rather than fighting, had been used as a vehicle to resolve conflict. Considering the resolution of the situation in the former Yugoslavia—which seems to have emerged from intervention by the United States administration under President Clinton—one might hope that a resolution might be achieved in Cyprus between the Turkish minority and the Greek majority.

         Whatever has happened in the past needs to be set aside. It may be that the types of peacekeeping operations to which the United Nations is committed, with American support, within the former Yugoslavia could be applied to Cyprus. I was a member of the government when Australian police were first committed to Cyprus. It is incredible that forces have been kept there from 1964 to 1995—31 years. Our bipartisan concern has always been that we should participate in peacekeeping operations wherever they might be. I have long felt that in many instances peacekeeping operations are better carried out by police than by armed forces.

         We do not want to be there forever. Australia has no long- or even short-term territorial ambitions. Our desire is to broker a peace. It seems to me that it would have been better if we had been able to train the people of Cyprus to undertake the peacekeeping role themselves. We need to consider the reasons why Australians still need to be in Cyprus after all this time. If there is no capacity to form a peacekeeping entity within Cyprus itself, perhaps the European Union or nations nearby could set up some sort of multinational peacekeeping police force.

         It seems to me that the Commonwealth may have a role to play. After all, Cyprus is a member of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has just returned from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Auckland. For all that many of us have been a little sceptical about the long-term relevance of the Commonwealth following the establishment of a democratic government in South Africa and the ending of apartheid, I am still doubtful whether, from the sorts of resolutions which I have seen coming from Auckland, the Commonwealth can really claim to be a viable and effective organisation merely on the basis of the exclusion of Nigeria from membership, on grounds which I totally endorse, and its condemnation of French nuclear testing in the Pacific. It would be far more meaningful if, as in Europe, so in the Commonwealth there could be a deliberate move within the countries which are members of the Commonwealth to ensure that one of the member countries complies with what we would see as an appropriate means to establish democratic rule.

         For that reason it is a pity that the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting did not adopt a motion akin to that which is before this House. Had the Commonwealth reaffirmed its total support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus as the only legitimate authority on the island, it might well have given the lead and perhaps the Commonwealth could have looked to ways by which from that it could have implemented other parts of this peace process towards which the motion before us is addressed. It could be that, instead of having just a United Nations police or a European police element, it might be a Commonwealth police element. After all, something similar was developed for Bougainville in order to ensure that the two warring sides there might be able to have peace talks. While I totally support the idea of maintaining Australian police in Cyprus, it seems to me that that is not a commitment that should be without some ultimate date of termination.

         I support the motion and commend the idea of resolution 939 of 1994 and the processes that the United Nations has set for resolution of the conflict. In so doing, let me say that I have always been concerned about the capacity of the United Nations to implement its decisions. So much depends on the major players, particularly the US, as to whether anything is achieved. Australia does have a capacity to get behind countries like the United States in implementing resolution 939, but the United Nations itself also has a responsibility. One would hope that the collective membership of the Security Council can adopt the resolution and proceed towards stopping the potential for continued outbreaks of fighting between the Turkish minority and the Greek majority on the island.

         I remain one of those who would hope that there can be a democratic solution to the troubles of this war torn republic. The motion before the House shows the good intent of the members of the Australian community as much as the members of the Australian parliament. One would hope that from it the Australian government might be able to play an even more significant role towards implementing peace between the two sides. Cyprus is an important country in the Mediterranean. It is a country which has long had an association with Australia. It was, like Australia, originally a British territory. When it achieved independence in 1959, everyone hoped that might allow it to develop freely and democratically but, as a number of speakers have said, after the assassination of Archbishop Makarios affairs there have been extraordinarily volatile. Peace does not prevail. There are many who doubt the good intentions of Turkey at this time and it is up to others to try to broker between Turkey and Greece to ensure that Cyprus can be a truly independent nation that can achieve its own sovereignty and territorial status and that the warring parties can be put at final arm's length through the demilitarisation which paragraph 7 of the motion suggests. I commend and support the motion.

I prevail on all members of this chamber, of the Senate and of the wider community who from time to time might give their attention to this question to maintain an honest, genuine and deliberately bipartisan attitude towards it.

         It was in 1960 that Cyprus became an independent republic. Its sovereignty and territorial integrity were guaranteed by a treaty that was signed by Britain, Turkey and Greece. In 1974, Northern Cyprus was invaded by Turkey. I know there was a lot of confusion, uncertainty, ambiguity and controversy about the circumstances that immediately preceded that invasion. I think that is of little concern today. The concern today should be to bring about an equitable, sensible, long-lasting and honourable solution to that terrible, tragic, continuing partition of an island one-seventh the size of Tasmania, with its top northern third separated off.

         Cyprus is an island in the Mediterranean, `Mediterranean' meaning the middle of the world. Cyprus was on the crossroads of the ancient world. It was subjected over the centuries to successive invasions and occupations. One would hope that the people of Cyprus—the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots—in today's contemporary world would have been able to find a sensible and honourable accommodation one with the other so that that little jewel in the Mediterranean could be looked on by the people of the world as one island, one people and one nation.

         Irrespective of whether it is a federated settlement or not, there is obviously a need for the demilitarisation of northern Cyprus and the withdrawal of the Turkish troops who occupy northern Cyprus. Those Cypriots who have been forced to leave their homes and who have had their property expropriated from them should be able to return in peace and with goodwill occupy their properties and live alongside those Turkish neighbours with whom they lived prior to 1974. There is a need for all of those things to be given consideration and for those questions to be resolved.

         We have a great and historic association with Cyprus and Cypriots. Like so many people from so many other countries and areas of the world, Australia has been able to welcome Turkish and Greek Cypriots into the bosom of the Australian community. They have been well accommodated. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Dr Andrew Theophanous, and his brother Theo, leader of the Labor Party in the upper house in Victoria, were both born in Cyprus.

         —I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the statement that was delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) yesterday in reporting on his participation in the APEC conference in Osaka, Japan, together with 17 other leading heads of government—presidents and prime ministers—representing all of the 18 member countries of APEC.

         The Prime Minister has also made the observation from time to time that prior to APEC there was no single forum where all those heads of government and heads of state could meet together. He has made the observation that, as a result of the APEC forum, they now know one another personally—they sit together, they talk together, they dine together, they laugh together, they address the same problems together.

         APEC is important because it has now provided a framework which will ensure our continuing and deeper integration into the dynamic region around us with all of the economic, political and strategic benefits which follow from that. It is of deep and long-term significance to Australia. In this context that is the important point. There are some people who have looked at the short-term objectives and have suggested with some legitimacy—and I do not want to diminish the genuineness and validity of their concerns—that the short-term objectives appear perhaps to be less than we would have preferred.

Sixty per cent of the world's GDP and half the world's trade is accounted for within the 18 countries of the Asia-Pacific region, of which Australia is one.

There have been many occasions when the Prime Minister personally and senior ministers in this government in their own areas of responsibility have taken the opportunity of bringing together many of the heads of state and heads of government in those countries. There has been a significant innovating force directed from this government.

In terms of integrity, in terms of a moral presence and in terms of the respect afforded any of those member countries, Australia stands tall. It is great to think that Australia does have an opportunity to make the significant contribution that it has been making. In his ministerial statement yesterday, the Prime Minister said:

        I agree with the Prime Minister. I am also conscious of some of the reservations which have been expressed by well-informed commentators about some of these shorter term objectives.

         What the leaders did at Osaka was to agree to draw up timetables for scrapping trade barriers ahead of next year's leaders summit in Manila. They also renewed the pledge that they made initially at Bogor in Indonesia last year that developed economies would dismantle all trade barriers by the year 2010. The 18 countries of the world which belong to the Asia-Pacific region, which produce 60 per cent of the world's wealth and which conduct 50 per cent of the world's trade, made a solemn declaration to abolish by the year 2010 all restrictions on trade. That was a historic decision if ever there was one. They said that the developing countries would reach that same objective one decade later—in 2020.

We live by trade. We must trade, and we cannot trade with countries that put up trade barriers against Australia. Our products have to be able to penetrate into those economies.

         Ninety-five years ago, this continent went through the experience of abolishing trade barriers between what were then the equivalent of six different countries. Then we called them colonies. Today we call them states of the Australian Commonwealth, states of the Australian federation. The world has gone a long way in the 95 years since we tore down those divisions between six countries that we called colonies, turned them into states and established the federation of Australia.

That is now the way the world is moving. What happened to this continent 95 years ago increasingly will happen to the global economy.

         Those barriers are coming down. What we have to do, of course, is manage the way in which they come down. I believe this government has done that admirably as seen by the fact that we have been able to tear away all of the constraints on the productive capacity of Australia and to go through all of that restructuring we have gone through, since 1983 in particular. Those people on the opposition side who purport to be the economic managers, for all of the time and times they were in government before 1983, did none of that.

         Australia is now better off. Australia has restructured its industry. Australia now is one of the highest growing countries of the OECD—one of the most affluent countries of the Western world. We have done that in a managed, sensible way. There have been no knee-jerk reactions. Of course there have been occasions on which we have had to dig our heels in, when the pressure has been on the government to reverse its position, to change its direction. It has been necessary for this government to ensure that the objectives it set for itself would be achieved.

         Some commentators have suggested that APEC will start to evolve like an OECD for the Asia-Pacific region. I understand what is meant by that, and I hope it does more than that. We do not want another OECD in the Asia-Pacific region. We want APEC out there pursuing the objectives that APEC has set for itself. When we do that, the whole of the Asia-Pacific region will be more viable, it will be more integrated, it will be more interdependent and, as a result, all of those other objectives that we so frequently set for ourselves will be better achieved.

I would say in passing that he miscasts the very wise leadership role that Jack McEwen gave to this country, particularly in pushing through the Australia-Japan trade treaty in 1957. I am sorry to say—as he is a good friend of mine—that he also ignored the role between Australia and New Zealand established by CER, the closer economic relations agreement, which was spearheaded by Doug Anthony when in government.

Japan's ability to lead APEC into the action phase came under question; ongoing spats between the USA and Japan and the USA and China on market access were a potential threat to the very fabric of APEC; and Malaysia's determination to elevate its East Asian economic caucus could also have been divisive.

         I welcome the initiatives outlined in the action agenda agreed to in Osaka. The agenda provides a blueprint for the future of APEC. I believe that if APEC is to be the pacemaker in global trade liberalisation, and indeed it is emerging as such, then it is important that the region's economies commit themselves to principles of comprehensiveness, world trade organisation consistency, comparability, non-discrimination, transparency, flexibility and cooperation. It is equally important that the region's liberalisation agenda be accompanied by a timetable to achieve the long-term goal of open trade and investment.

         We have visited many of APEC's attributes in the past, and we recognise that it is a need of this parliament to get the right balance with regard to assessing APEC, the future of APEC, the achievements thus far with APEC, and what the practical outcomes will be flowing from APEC. I know my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Thomson) has studied in detail aspects of this and will have more to say about this and the way that some of the outcomes of APEC have been presented one way at the international level, quite differently in Singapore and quite differently in Japan.

         In that context, I welcome the range of trade and investment facilitation initiatives—initiatives that will result in benefits flowing through to the business community. The removal of non-tariff barriers is particularly welcomed because I would argue that, while tariff reduction is a more explicit process, often tariff reductions are replaced by a more subtle form of market impediments well-known to members on both sides of the House. If we can arrive at undertakings that would see the abolition of those forms of barriers to trade, the region will benefit enormously by such streamlining.

         I make a similar observation in regard to standards and conformance. As the Prime Minister has said, the harmonisation of customs procedures will also be of considerable benefit to Australian business. While I share the Prime Minister's hopes for APEC in the future, from a regional perspective there are, I suggest, several outstanding issues which should not be forgotten, which should be placed in perspective at the outcome of the Osaka summit. Those issues will continue to challenge its development, and I think that process does temper the Prime Minister's optimism.

         While the vexed question of agriculture was resolved, and Japan's leadership remained intact and so on, I am concerned about the fragility of the very foundations of the APEC forum, especially in the context of disputation and working through disputation problems. The point I want to make is that, it seems to me, if there is to be substantive cooperation among Asia-Pacific governments as they move towards the ambitious target set at Bogor—2010, 2020—and ratified at Osaka, there will need to be a high degree of mutual respect and confidence.

         It has to be said, when we look back over the record of regional disputation, that that sense of trust does not yet fully exist. Progress has been made, but we are not by any means in the end game. To create the conditions in which serious practical cooperation on facilitating or liberalising trade and investment can be expected, all Asia-Pacific governments in my view will need to work together on at least two urgent issues: to create confidence about the capacity and willingness to accommodate China—obviously a very large player in the first half of the next century and obviously a very large player already today—in the world economy; and to change the way disputes about trade policies are dealt with by Asia-Pacific governments.

         It is undeniable that the frequency and severity of disputes about trade policy, and the practicalities of trade policy between the US and its major East Asian trading partners, have increased in recent years. There appears to be a growing tendency for the US to link trade policy with issues including labour rights, environmental policy and political matters such as the definition of human rights. Moreover, the USA seems to prefer to seek reform of trade policies it perceives to be unfair by threats of retaliation under section 301 of its own legislation, rather than using the dispute resolution mechanisms available elsewhere, most notably with the WTO. These tendencies, and the disputes arising from them, create uncertainty and, as emphasised strongly in the 1995 report of the APEC Eminent Persons Group, they are making it very difficult to achieve the degree of cooperation which will be needed for the APEC process to succeed.

I welcome the efforts made and some of the advisings given in this regard, but all of that has to be matched with micro-economic reform and further progress right here in Australia. All of that has to be matched with removal of the taxation structure impediments and other factors which militate against Australia being able to cut the mustard competitively at the international level and compete effectively across the wide spectrum of goods. I do not mean just primary industry goods but the many services which Australia today exports. Other manufactured goods, including Australian whitegoods, have a very tight situation to face with their export efforts and have a series of tariff concession applications raining in on them, which are administered in a hostile way too often by the Canberra bureaucracy.

Let us just review a little of the history of APEC, because I can assure you that we on this side of the House are extremely proud of the fact that APEC essentially is an Australian initiative—it is an Australian government initiative. APEC was inaugurated in January 1989 at the initiative of the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and the first meeting of 12 economies was held in Canberra in November 1989. In 1991 at APEC's third meeting in Seoul, the Republic of Korea was able to negotiate the entry of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan; in 1993 Mexico and Papua New Guinea joined; and at the Seattle meeting in 1993 Chile was accepted, joining in November 1994 and bringing the membership to its present level of 18 countries.

         APEC's share of world trade has risen from 36.2 per cent in 1980 to over 45 per cent in 1994. This is largely as a result of East Asia's strong export performance. In the five years to 1994, APEC exports grew at a trend rate of 9.6 per cent annually, and that compares with total world exports which have increased at an annual rate of five per cent. As I said previously, we are indeed fortunate that we are aligned, that we are a driving force, and that we are an industrial nation belonging to what is going to become the largest trade bloc in the world economy. As an initiator, of course, we stand to receive significant benefits.

         Australian beef is a classic example. As a beef producer, I am concerned that beef producers do not get a fair return for their product. When you go to Japan, you see that a product which may be selling for $7 or $8 a kilogram in Australia is selling for many times that amount in Japan. Yet the Australian producer is finding it extremely difficult to make a profit in producing that commodity. The profit is not being made by Australian companies; it is being made by the vertically integrated Japanese companies, which are engaged in growing, slaughtering, packaging and transporting, and in selling machinery. Australians have to accept the challenge. They have to say, `The market is there. It is not going to come to us. We have to go to it.'

Analysts expect that the APEC summit will produce a $40 billion boost to the Australian economy, creating over 500,000 new jobs in the next two decades. Trade liberalisation will contribute $25 billion; the cutting of red tape, through the cooperation that is engendered in the APEC agreement, will provide another $15 billion saving for Australians. Real income is expected to increase by 6.8 per cent, due to regional free trade by the year 2020.

I know that Goninans in Newcastle is a major player in the production of rolling stock, and there is no doubt that the APEC agreement is welcomed by them because it means that firms such as Goninans which are involved in heavy industry—and I know it also participates in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile—will receive benefits. There will be additional workers in both Newcastle and in the electorate of Lyne as a result of APEC.

         —As all previous speakers in the chamber have indicated, both sides of politics strongly support the APEC arrangements. Members opposite seem to have put a gloss on what has been achieved in reality. The honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne), who spoke a moment ago, has perhaps hit the nail on the head when he said that APEC offers great potential for Australia and we certainly hope that that potential comes to fruition.

         There has been over many years a period of dialogue. Many countries have had individual problems with some of the goals of APEC, and those discussions have resulted in bold declarations. We had Bogor last year and more recently we had Osaka. Unfortunately, as yet, we have not seen anything tangible to benefit the Australian economy from APEC. We continue to be offered more hope, and we welcome that hope, but we look forward to achievements of substance and positive tangible benefits to reward Australia and other countries participating in the APEC process for the taxpayers' dollars that have been spent on APEC to date.

It has been said that freer trade has been one-sided and that some Australian producers, particularly primary producers, have been disadvantaged. It is not contested by anyone that the Asia-Pacific region is indeed the fastest growing, the most dynamic, part of the world and we are fortunate to be geographically situated in this region.

These points were highlighted only yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition. We are not proud of these facts. They are a tragedy.

         Our merchandise trade surplus with the APEC region has actually declined, Mr Deputy Speaker—and I can see that you looked shocked at this—from $5.8 billion in 1990-91 to $1.8 billion in 1994-95. That is a reduction of $4 billion in four years, and one would hope that the government is going to look seriously at that major problem because we ought to be encouraging the growth of our trade into this region. The fact that our trade surplus has been cut back so dramatically, particularly at a time when we have such an ongoing trade deficit, is something that the government must look at.

         Last year, I was privileged to visit Singapore as part of a parliamentary delegation, and I was impressed to see that Australia had a very large proportion of dairy products being sold through supermarkets in Singapore. I am told that some 60 per cent of dairy products sold in Singapore comes from Australia but, of course, there should be more. When one looks through stores in Singapore, particularly supermarkets, one finds that we are not the food basket for Asia to the extent that we should be. Collectively, we as a community must do more to trade into this area. I know the government would certainly like to see our trade exports increase into East Asia, but the result has been that, over four years, our surplus has dropped by some $4 billion.

         The Bogor declaration was an important milestone. At that time, the APEC economies committed themselves to the goal of free and open trade in the Asia-Pacific by 2010—at the latest—by industrialised countries, and by 2020 by developing countries. Of course, we support this, 100 per cent. It is an ambitious aim. A lot of people talked about the Osaka summit this year and how certain countries wanted to opt out in relation to various areas, including agriculture, but I am pleased that an agreement was reached at Osaka to say, in effect, that there would be no backsliding and that the end dates of 2010 and 2020 would remain.

The APEC economies are very important to the world. For instance, the 18 APEC economies have some 60 per cent of the world's GDP and half of its trade.

It is interesting to note that Australia has been one of the most gung-ho countries talking about removing trade barriers.

         We believe that the declaration at Osaka, while certainly welcome, did not go as far as it should have. In fact, the government itself would have liked to have seen it go further. For instance, the Commonwealth wanted some quantitative measures and milestones to keep countries honest in delivering on their pledge, and a firm agreement ruling out any rises in protection. Other countries wanted more to be included in the final declaration, but those other countries were not successful either.

         —By any measure or understanding of Australia's best interests, APEC and the Osaka action agenda are irresistibly logical and irresistibly good. A small trading nation like Australia will not find an economy of scale on its domestic market of 17 million people sufficient to sustain all industries in all parts of the economy. Nor will such a small market ever produce sufficient private sector competition—the competition, continuous upgrading and innovation needed for a prosperous domestic economy.

         Australia's solution, Australia's future, is reflected in the APEC agenda: to continue to open our markets to international competition as the catalyst for dynamic industry upgrading; and to seek success and penetration on global markets, finding competitive advantages and an economy of scale beyond the limits of our small domestic market. This is, of course, the model and the formula for success that has been developed by small trading nations around the world since World War II, most notably Italy, Sweden and Switzerland in Europe and in Asia the Asian tigers, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.

         When it is all said and done, there is a clear difference in the trade and economic policies on the various sides of this parliament. The difference is this: the Labor Party wants to see Australia develop into much more than a quarry and a farm. The National and Liberal parties would limit us to this by not allowing our manufacturing and service industries to penetrate markets in the Asia-Pacific.

         We have seen, in recent decades, how the world has been breaking into trade groupings—most notably, the European Union and NAFTA. Australia, by culture and geography, has had no natural grouping to slide into, so we have had to make our way into APEC. We have had to bring together the Asia-Pacific as a new form of trade architecture and develop a new trade forum. We have made our way into the Asia-Pacific and APEC by virtue of leadership. The benefits of leadership, Labor leadership, Keating leadership, have brought together the Asia-Pacific as Australia's trade grouping in response to the way in which Europe and North America had been forming trade blocks.

         The Osaka achievements are essentially four-fold. The first is that the Osaka agreement, the Osaka achievement, confirms the Asia-Pacific grouping and does not allow any backsliding to a solely Asian economic and trade forum. It is the preference, of course, of Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, to have an Asian-only economic and trade grouping. I would have thought that the recognition by other Asian nations at APEC of the need for an Asian-Pacific focus signals the end of what has been known as the Asian values debate.

Asian values do have benefits for producing dynamic growth economies, but so too do other values and cultures. It is very significant that in Singapore they are now talking about the Pacific way, a flexible combination of Eastern and Western values and culture.

         The second achievement at Osaka was to keep agriculture in the cart, as part of the APEC agreement. This is a very difficult matter, and I am always interested in debates such as  this to hear and learn of the tension between globalism and localism. We have seen in recent decades economic and political power around the world gravitate towards global and local arenas. There are tensions in an issue like this because we have various speakers in this debate and in other forums talking about the benefits of global free trade, but they are sometimes not too comfortable when they have to deal with the local consequences of those economic relations and economic environment.

In Europe in particular—and I am sure this will be reflected ultimately in the Asia-Pacific—there is a change in public opinion. Why should manufacturing and service sector workers exposed to international competition, not receiving subsidies from government, see agriculture receive subsidies and protection?

         The fourth achievement of Osaka—and this is a marvel of modern government—is that APEC reflects a logical response to the globalisation of capital. I have previously quoted in the House the way in which the McKinsey organisation has projected that international investment will reach $83 trillion by the year 2000. It is sensible, given that dimension of investment and trade around the world and the mobility of capital, for governments to defend their interests and continue their countervailing role by cooperating together. If capital is globalising itself, the institutions of government and the decision making processes also need to act within a global framework. Economic power is shifting to the global arena and it is logical for political power to also move to that arena.

         Let us not just focus on the narrow band of the Osaka meeting that has just taken place and the results that have come out of that. There have been a number of meetings. Let us go back to the first meeting in Seattle in 1993. Last year, there was the Bogor meeting, out of which came the Bogor declaration, which basically set out the goals of the APEC group for trade liberalisation by the years 2010 and 2020. This year, the recently completed Osaka meeting put together an action agenda setting out the principles which will underpin, I suppose, the process of trade liberalisation and trade facilitation in the Asia-Pacific region, as we move towards those target dates that were established in Bogor.

         As some of the previous speakers have said, this is good and well. I think that all Australians should be committed to the process, if it delivers the benefits that have been spoken of so far and that it is supposed to deliver. Nobody would argue the fact that we are, and will be in the future, an integral part of this region. We are here. We should be involved in the trading bloc that is being established in this region.

         Conversely, we should have a look at what Australia's share of the world's trade and the world's GDP actually is. It is undeniable that Australia's share of East Asian imports has dropped 20 per cent in the last 10 years. Since 1983, we have lost some market share in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Brunei. Our merchandise trade surplus within the APEC region has declined from $5.8 billion in 1990-91 to $1.8 billion in 1994-95.

         We need to maintain perspective in this whole discussion.

Australia's share of that has been declining. We have to pay attention to and try to quell that declining involvement in the APEC area. To that end, what is being established and put in place should address that situation. It really is incumbent upon the members of the APEC group and this government and future governments involved in sitting around that table, whether it be the Prime Minister of the day or the trade minister of the day, to ensure that APEC creates confidence.

Domestic micro-economic reform in Australia has stalled. It has stalled and we have to crank it up if we are going to compete with these countries, because they do not work on that basis.

         Recently, the Leader of the Opposition and member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), in his speech to the Asia-Australian Institute, tried to sneak onto centre stage and dip his foot in the spotlight by saying it was a coalition initiative that provided the foundations for APEC—harking back to Malcolm Fraser's dalliances with the Japanese in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the debate today a lot of the coalition members have referred to that, with the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) touching on it less than 10 minutes ago.

         APEC was originally conceived in 1989—a long time after the member for Bennelong and his coalition at the time bit the political dust.

In saying that they could see into the future, I do not for a minute entertain the notion that those members of the Labor government in 1989 had supernatural powers—not quite.

Six years down the track, with all of the gains we have so far won for all Australians, perhaps it is time to spell out again, for their benefit, what the success of APEC and a strong APEC agreement means to the future of our country.

         I agree with the recent comments of the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) that most Australians have heard about APEC but that not many know what it means for Australian businesses, the Australian economy, or for the average Australian in terms of jobs and other opportunities. As with any major development involving our nation's economy or trade performance, there is a propensity for our economic boffins to take the reins and guide debate above the heads of ordinary Australians. The successes of APEC are just too important to let that happen.

         It would be a great tragedy for Australians to have APEC and all that it means slide by without demonstrating to them that the agreement is a defining moment in our nation's history. One of the features of the federal Labor government, during its 12 years in office, has been its direction of our foreign, trade and economic policies towards Asia. Australia's role in Asia has at times become a divisive issue; it has been championed, chastised and chattered about with increasing frequency. Some neighbours have at times questioned our motives and the commitment behind our intentions—quite rightly so, given this nation's chequered history in its dealings with the region. Others have welcomed our involvement in regional affairs with open arms.

         As our relationship with the Asia-Pacific region has strengthened, and in particular with Asia, it has meant that Australians have had to address extremely important issues related to our history, our heritage and our future. Throughout the history of Australia since white settlement, from colonial settlement through Federation, the two world wars and into the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, our nation has deferred to the power of the United Kingdom or the United States on most matters of international importance. By looking to take a leading role in Asia and committing ourselves wholeheartedly to APEC, Australia over the last 12 years has signalled to the world that its relationship with these two nations, and the way in which it sees itself, has now changed. I am sure that this will be a talking point for historians and social commentators for many years to come.

         During these discussions I will have to beg to differ. In my view, it is our emerging relationship with Asia—a region culturally, economically and socially different to ourselves—and specifically with APEC, which signals Australia's real coming of age. Achieving Federation during the dying groans of the British Empire, and beginning to trust our abilities at a time when the United States has once again turned its attention upon itself, we have finally become confident enough to stand on our own two feet by admitting our future lies with Asia. It promises great changes, great possibility and great challenges.

         A strong APEC agreement, and Australia's position in that agreement, does not only mean a flow-on of economic benefits, although this is one of the major results. It means that the changes that have been discussed so frequently concerning Australia's role with its traditional partners, the UK and the US, have finally and decisively begun to take shape. With it will come gradual changes to our society, our cultural life and the way that we see ourselves as a nation.

         I do not mean that Sydney will become Hong Kong or that Melbourne will become Jakarta. Australia will always remain Australia, but by organising APEC and ushering its members forward, cementing agreements, finalising objectives and orchestrating what will eventually become the greatest trading boom the world has ever seen Australia has suddenly stopped standing in the corner with its shoulders hunched like some awkward adolescent young boy waiting to be allowed to join in the conversation of the adults. Australia is now stepping forward confidently as a young adult, responsible and ready to work with our immediate partners. Apart from what APEC means for us historically, for our standing in the region or for our own self-confidence, it spells economic gains that at the moment seem potentially limitless.

         It has been mentioned before that 75 per cent of all Australia's exports now go to the region. It is perhaps more important to place that 75 per cent of exports into context with the rest of the region. One thing that needs to be impressed upon Australians is the economic enormity of the Asia-Pacific region. As our Prime Minister pointed out yesterday, the 18 APEC countries already account for 60 per cent of the world's GDP and half of its trade. More goods are now traded within the area, one country to another, than are traded within North America or the European Community. Sixty-six per cent of APEC countries' exports go to member states whereas in the European Community it is 61 per cent and in the North American free trade agreement it is 42 per cent. We are dealing with economic muscle power of an almost mind-boggling dimension. Better though than just contemplating it, we are actively harnessing that energy in great leaps and bounds.

         One of the agreements that makes APEC unique is that the leaders of APEC countries have now set themselves concrete objectives. Despite initial reservations from individual nations, the goals that have been set are achievable and I wager they will be achieved by those set dates. Those nations that have approached APEC's goals somewhat hesitatingly no doubt really know that the agreement is entirely within their best interest, just as it is in Australia's, to bring down tariff walls and to promote free trade.

         As the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) has stated in this House, while representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Trade, it is expected that APEC will increase income for all its members to the tune of some $993 billion when its combined effects flow through. That is $993 billion for everybody, and in particular the developing nations within APEC. The mind boggles at such a figure. As our minister pointed out, that is worth more than the Australian and South Korean economies combined, more than 10 times the size of the Malaysian economy and 1 1/2 times the size of China's economy—spread across all 18 APEC nations.

We are not going to reap the benefits at another country's expense and I believe the lesser developed nations that have joined in APEC can see that as well. Our APEC goals of promoting open markets throughout the region are fully consistent with our neighbours' desires to create growth and jobs for their own people. Open markets generate growth. It is as simple as that. Setting ourselves such clear objectives makes the job of harnessing the economic muscle power of the Asia-Pacific region so much easier.

         Talking about taking steps forward, I was particularly interested to hear the statement by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong, in the House yesterday in support of the Prime Minister's success in Osaka and, as such, his leadership in previous APEC meetings. I am pleased—and I am glad that the member for Bennelong is in the chamber—that the opposition now supports the government's handling of our involvement in APEC. Yet I must point out that, despite the honourable member's repeated assurances that his comments in no way begrudge the government's vision, the messages that his colleagues have been sending the Australian people over the previous few weeks in the lead-up to the APEC meeting have been contrary to this. I, like everybody else, have watched the evening news and read the newspapers over the last few weeks. Virtually all the members of the opposition who were discussing APEC have come out and said that they had hoped the Prime Minister would fail in Osaka, meaning they hoped Australia would fail. How courageous of them. How full of national pride they are.

         Yitzhak Rabin was a remarkable individual. His whole life was dominated by his absolute commitment to the state of Israel and to its people. From his birth in Jerusalem in 1922 he was at or near the centre of most events which created and shaped his country. His life was devoted first to the foundation of Israel, and then to ensuring its survival.

         For many years Mr Rabin expressed this commitment through his distinguished career as a soldier. He fought in the 1948 War of Independence, then served for more than 20 years as a member of the Israeli Defence Force. His military career culminated in his appointment as Chief of Staff of the IDF and its commander during the Six-Day War. After five years as Israel's ambassador to the United States, Mr Rabin returned to Israel in 1973 to enter politics. Just as his military career was driven by his unswerving commitment to Israel's security, so was his life as a political leader.

         Although that deep commitment never changed, its form did—and quite profoundly. During his second term as Prime Minister after 1992, Mr Rabin came to the view cautiously—almost reluctantly, but I believe irresistibly—that the cause to which he had committed his life, that is Israel's survival and security, was now best served by a sustained effort to negotiate a settlement with the Palestinians.

         This did not represent any change in his fundamental beliefs. But he had the imagination and the courage to recognise that military superiority alone could not deliver lasting security for Israel. And he understood that a change of approach of parallel importance was taking place among the Palestinian leadership as well.

         This represented a fundamental shift in policy for Israel and many Israelis, of course, were unsettled by it. Possibly only Rabin, with his unassailable reputation as a defender of Israel's security, could have carried most of the country with him in following this new path.

         The breakthrough came with the signature on 13 September 1993 of the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles. In that document, for the first time ever, Israel and the Palestinians recognised each other as part of the same neighbourhood and accepted the need to deal with each other as neighbours. That historic recognition was symbolised when Mr Rabin shook the hand of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat on the lawn at the White House in September 1993.

         That handshake was the beginning, not the end, of a process. Despite the intense political pressure Mr Rabin came under, pressure which went well beyond the normal and acceptable bounds of political debate, he remained determined to keep the peace process going. Under his leadership, the peace treaty with Jordan was signed in October 1994 and then the interim agreement with the Palestinians, just two months before his death. The worth and substance of Mr Rabin's achievements not just for Israel but for the Middle East and the world were recognised when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, together with Mr Shimon Peres and the PLO Chairman, Yasser Arafat.

         The great shock of Yitzhak Rabin's assassination was not so much that it happened, as shocking as that was, as violence in the politics of the Middle East is tragically common; it was that he was killed by another Israeli. At the core of Israel's existence has always been its role as a sanctuary for the Jewish people. His assassin has done more than rob us all of the life and potential of Yitzhak Rabin, he has cheated the Jewish people of the security of the belief to which so many Israelis had dedicated themselves, that Israel was a place where above all else human rights and human happiness were the foundations and strengths of the society.

The fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians could sit down together after all the murders, assassinations and assaults upon the state of Israel and all the other bitterness in the Middle East was really the stuff of which most of us a few years ago thought only dreams were made.

         In many ways, to me and many Australians, whatever their politics, Rabin symbolised the robust struggle of Israel from the time of her birth in 1948 as a separate sovereign Jewish state until the present. He was the commander in chief of the Israeli armed forces during the extraordinary victory that was won in the Six-Day War in 1967. He was the defence minister who gave the order for the Israeli commanders who recaptured those who had been taken hostage at Entebbe in Uganda by the Palestinians in 1976. He then entered domestic politics after a period of time as ambassador to the United States. After encountering some reverses in his first stint as Prime Minister, he spent a long period in Israeli politics, finally returning only a few years ago to deliver the finest hour of his political contribution to the country in which he was born and the country that he loved so much.

         —The death of Yitzhak Rabin by assassination is one of those great tragedies, one of those great shocks, of this century. Yitzhak Rabin did the hardest thing of all in politics: he moved his own people beyond the bounds of comfort to areas where they had to place their faith in their leader. It is an additional tragic burden that his death was by the hand of a man of the Jewish faith—a Jew whose testament includes the prophetic story in Zechariah 13:6, which I quote:

        The prophetic nature of Rabin's death is exemplified by his last words at that famous and now historic Tel Aviv peace rally, from which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) quoted in part. Yitzhak Rabin said:

       <para>
        The tragic irony of Rabin's death by assassination is almost overwhelming. Israelis had always assumed that they were safe amongst themselves. After all, the entire point to the formation of the state of Israel after World War II and the appalling Holocaust was a sense of security—security in a religious context and in a physical sense for those of the Jewish faith.

         Only a man of Rabin's qualities and background could have delivered a peace agreement with the Palestinians and the Jordanians. If you go to some of the places on either side of the Dead Sea you will see the warm peace between Israel and Jordan beginning to bear commercial fruit in a very practical way. Rabin was trusted as part of that peace process, perhaps more so because he was a former army chief of staff. He was a man whose demeanour—his simplicity of style—bespoke his strength and authority.

         There is a term used within the Jewish faith which has in part an Arabic background—`dugri'. `Dugri' describes behaviour which is that of substance, not of style. It exemplifies simplicity, directness and honesty. It conveys the placing of substance before style, of stripping away any pretence or deception. In short, it speaks of commonsense and direct speech.

         It is such an approach, an approach which exemplifies Yitzhak Rabin—his life, his times, his work and his contribution—which gave confidence to the people of Israel, confidence in his striking a peace accord with the Palestinians and the Jordanians and commencing the path of peace elsewhere in the Middle East with Syria and Lebanon. When the peace accord was struck between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, he said in an address to the Palestinian people:

        Yitzhak Rabin was a man who understood that at the end of the day there had to be a peace with Palestinians and Arabs more generally. He argued that it was completely wrong to the democratic tradition of the Jewish people to subjugate another people. Subjugation of Jews was, after all, the inspiration behind Zionism and the eventual formation of the Jewish state.

         One of the things that gave the signing of the peace accord so much power was the performance of Rabin. Other politicians—lesser politicians—may have tried to bask in the glory of that historic event, but it belonged essentially to Rabin. To those of us who watched it on the evening news, what we saw was Rabin performing a difficult and uncomfortable but necessary activity. It was the performance of a man who had `dugri'.

         It is all the more poignant that these terrible events actually occurred in the 50th year of the conclusion of hostilities in World War II. The really defining event of that war was the Holocaust. It was out of the Holocaust that came the international sentiment with the Jewish people that led to the creation of the state of Israel. The state of Israel was a matter of survival. That war also saw the beginning of Yitzhak Rabin's career as a soldier. He joined Jewish military organisations and then Palestine in the early part of the war. He then fought in the struggle to make real the United Nations creation of Israel immediately after that.

         What an extraordinary thing, and an indication of the quality of the man, that at a very young age he would be one of the principal negotiators for Israel on the separation of the forces.

It is impossible for us to understand or comprehend what being confronted daily with the horror of annihilation, and with the experience of it, does to a mind, particularly a military mind.

         —I join with my colleagues in expressing my deep condolences on the tragic assassination of Yitzhak Rabin—a great soldier, a peacemaker, and a man who I think will be remembered in that rare category of `statesman'. He was a man, born in Israel, who had a primary concern throughout all stages of his life for the security of Israel. Early in Israel's history he argued that security could only be obtained through strength. Of course, in that respect he was absolutely right. But his genius was also to recognise the changing environment of the Middle East and, therefore, to conclude that the long-term security of Israel could only come through negotiating peace. He achieved this goal, despite enormous domestic political opposition, and it must be remembered—and of course it will be because of the nature of his tragic death.

         Yitzhak Rabin was the classic Israeli Sabra—prickly on the outside but soft on the inside. Henry Kissinger said of him that he was that rare man who was not only tough but also educated and far-sighted. He took enormous risks for peace, and was always aware of those risks to his life. He was a leader who led by placing himself at risk rather than by placing others at risk. So his death cannot be allowed to give his assassin, and those who would comfort his assassin, the victory they want by derailing the peace process.

         Yitzhak Rabin obtained a special strength, and was probably the only person in Israel who had the strength at the time, to negotiate a peace process—which he did through what became known as the Oslo accords—because of the special trust that the people of Israel had in him. It is quite true, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) said earlier, that most of us first came to hear of Yitzhak Rabin during the Six-Day War. His capacity to manage and to win that war was an extraordinary achievement, and in terms of not just the stability of Israel but the stability of the world it was an absolutely vital victory.

         He was a man whom Israelis trusted to protect the security of Israel and a man whom they understood, through the difficult process of negotiating the Oslo accords, would never surrender the security of his country. It is probably true to say that he was the only person in Israel who could do that. Others may have wished to negotiate such accords, but the vast majority of the Israeli people would not have in those people the confidence that their security would always be guaranteed despite the negotiating process.

         Yitzhak Rabin initiated the Oslo talks and had the courage to pursue, sign and implement the Oslo agreement. He established relations with Jordan, the PLO and the Arab world in general, and the spring of 1995 saw Jordan and Israel exchange ambassadors for the first time. Even at the age of 73 he remained extremely active, beginning his working day at 6.30 a.m. and, very much to his credit, playing tennis regularly. Until the very moment of his death, he will have to be remembered as one of the truly great statesmen of the modern age.

         Yitzhak Rabin's initiatives have to be looked at in the context that, prior to them, there had been so much bitterness, so much hatred and so much conflict in the Middle East and that at one stage even the majority of the peoples of those nations were so afraid to make initiatives for peace. It was an enormous achievement to turn that around and to reach a situation in which there was so much optimism for peace.

         I can remember that in 1992 I had the privilege of leading a parliamentary delegation to the Middle East. In Israel, we were unable to meet with Mr Rabin but we met for quite some time with Mr Peres. At that time the new government had just been elected and had been in power for only a short time. There was discussion as to whether a man with Rabin's background—his military and general background in the armed forces—would be willing to really push the peace process.

         We asked that question of Mr Peres, and his response was very clear. He said, `Have faith in the Prime Minister of Israel. I know this man. Have faith in him.' I guess that faith was rewarded because soon after that particular meeting we saw big initiatives and, finally, we saw the Oslo declaration and all that other speakers have referred to in terms of the peace process.

         Let me say that bringing together sufficient sense in Israel that peace was possible was not an easy achievement.

He was able to reassure the people of Israel that whatever steps he was taking were steps that were not in any way going to compromise their security but were going to achieve a positive future for them.

I think everyone in the international community wishes him well in that. That small group of people who perpetrated this crime or who were behind this crime must not be allowed to succeed. There are extremists and people against peace in every nation and in every group. But, in the end, if humanity is to achieve something positive in this century, it has to achieve a resolution of this long conflict.

I share in the grief of the Australian Jewish community, of the people of Israel and, indeed, of most of the Australian community about what has occurred to this individual.

         After becoming Prime Minister of Israel in June 1992, he concentrated all of his efforts on bringing peace to the Middle East. It was a role perhaps that contrasted with his military career, which had in itself been distinguished. Rabin was the man behind the 1967 Six-Day War in which Israel seized territory from Syria, Egypt and Jordan. He was the man behind the June 1967 raid on Entebbe, Uganda, where commandos rescued more than 100 Israelis from a plane hijacked by Palestinians. This was the same man who shook hands with PLO leader Yasser Arafat in Washington in September 1993 and King Hussein of Jordan in July 1994 and who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Yasser Arafat just last year—1994.

         Under his guidance, the first Israeli-PLO agreement was signed, paving the way for autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza, and a formal peace treaty was signed with Jordan, ending a 46-year-old state of war. Just six days before his death, he and Arafat signed a further agreement expanding Palestinian autonomy. Rabin, at 73 years of age, was turning dreams of peace in the Middle East into reality—and he was central to that process. Without him, there would have been no secret talks in Oslo between Israel and Palestine, no meetings in Washington and no signing of peace accords.

The inspiration for that can be found in Mr Rabin's last public speech to 100,000 people at one of Tel Aviv's biggest peace rallies, on 4 November, the day of his death. He said:

         Sir Asher Joel, a very distinguished Jewish leader in our society, was a parliamentary colleague during my early days in politics. He was one of those who took me under his wing. From him I learnt not only of the extent to which the Jewish people have made a contribution to our society in Australia, but how a people who have suffered for so long and to such a great degree have contributed to making Israel the strong, solid, independent state that it is today. Yitzhak Rabin was the leader who gave them that momentum towards future peace which had been so long denied.

On my one and only visit to Israel I came across the Red Sea, through the Sinai, through the West Bank, through Tel Aviv and into Jerusalem.

         What has happened with the Oslo process, the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the change in US policy in the Middle East as a result of that—the fact that the United States and the Soviet Union, for that matter, no longer have client states there and dependence upon countries—is that the future of Rabin and Arafat obviously became massively intertwined. They both resisted forces and extremes—in the case of Arafat, Hamas—and other organisations financed, on many occasions, by countries that have deserted the PLO over many decades for their own self-interest and ironically, on the Israeli side, by religious zealots who in many cases do not even recognise the state of Israel and refuse to participate in its military exercises.

         That visit by Rabin and the comments of Leah Rabin in the weeks afterwards clearly drive home the immense importance of Rabin's role. He was a man who accomplished things that the Likud could never have accomplished, a man who was essentially there because he could be trusted by a wider spectrum in the electorate, a man who could force change that was very difficult. If there is one contribution that should be made it should be a commitment on a bipartisan basis in this country that Australia will continue to endorse strongly that peace process and will continue to give comfort and support to those forces that are facing massive challenges from extremists on either side.

         He was sent to the United States as ambassador as part of a grooming process, because there have been a series of Israeli leaders who had that experience. He came back and served two terms as Prime Minister of his country. Significantly, in the elections of June 1992 he was re-elected as Prime Minister because he was willing to `trade land for peace'.

         The 1967 war left Israel in a very strong geographic and military position in the Middle East, but it did not bring peace. By 1992 there was a growing perception that a deal had to be made with the Palestinian population. The concept of security in the past had been based on `creating facts'; build a cordon sanitaire around Israel was the only way to protect Israel. In that environment, where security was all important, it was Yitzhak Rabin, the former general, who had the courage of his convictions to take his country on a new course. He persisted with that right to the very moment of his death. Perhaps the greatest poignancy of that event is that we are all here today so many thousands of miles away from where the tragic event took place, but we in our own way share the pain and the suffering of the Israeli people.

         —The assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on Saturday, 4 November reminds us of the extreme fragility of public life and of the risks of exposure to the lone, deluded gunman convinced that he—it is rarely a she—can change the course of history by taking a life. If Hitler had been taken out in 1936 or 1937 it might have avoided World War 11 and the Holocaust. If the July 1944 attempt had succeeded, the terrible suffering of the last months of the war might have been shortened. But this would have been quite an exceptional case. As a general rule, assassination does not change the course of a historical process; it actually speeds it up. This is demonstrated by the murders of Lincoln, John Kennedy and many others.

         Yitzhak Rabin was a martyr to the peace process. His death guarantees that middle of the road Israelis realise that the cause of peace has to be worked for; it cannot be taken for granted and there must be resistance to every kind of fanaticism—the view that characterises difference in belief as enmity and threat, that terrible sense that people with different beliefs are your enemies and that they will kill you unless you seize the chance to kill them first.

         It was no secret that Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres had radically different approaches within the Israeli Labour Party. They were rivals for decades. Rabin's role as a general was critically important. He had been seen as a hardliner whose professional career was tied up with military action and physical survival. For Rabin, as an old soldier, to commit himself to the peace process was politically far more significant than was the commitment of Shimon Peres, who was seen as an archetypical civilian and, even worse, a diplomat. They worked together superbly on securing peace with security and justice.

         Last Thursday in Paris, at a 50th anniversary celebration of UNESCO, a ceremony that included 15 heads of state including President Chirac and President Mubarak, I heard Yasser Arafat pay a moving tribute to Yitzhak Rabin. It struck me then what terrible destruction could have been wreaked by a determined assassin. We must set ourselves very strongly against violence, intolerance and the arrogance of the individual who says, `I may not have a rational argument to make, but I speak with the authority of the gun in my pocket.' Rabin was a hero for peace and he deserves our deepest respect. We want to pass our respect and deep feelings to the government and people of Israel.

Prime Minister Rabin had displayed the greatest courage and daring in his pursuit of the peace process. He was a great leader and a visionary who had the clarity of sight needed to take advantage of the changes which had occurred in the international community since the collapse of the Soviet Union and since the Gulf War.

         He recognised that the old adversary of Israel, the PLO, had a genuine stake in the peace process. Rabin was so much a dedicated lover of peace that he was prepared to take risks to bring peace to reality. It was inevitable that the pursuit of peace would lead to a heightened political debate within Israel, with people of goodwill debating the merits of various steps and proposals. Israel, unlike the countries which predominate in the region, is a democracy—and democrats will debate.

         I became acutely aware in a personal sense of the difficulties and challenges of peace during my visit to Israel in June 1993. A man I am proud to call a friend, the former Israeli Ambassador to Australia, Yehuda Avner, who recently returned to Israel with a further mission to work with Rabin on the pursuit of peace, never made any secret of his view of the risks and the dangers of the process. In recent months, many Australian Jews, regardless of their sympathies with one side or the other of Israeli politics, watched with mounting concern the intensity and the virulence of language being used in Israel's domestic debates.

         The assassination of Rabin by a fanatic has the potential to bring a unity of purpose to the responsible leaders of Israel that, tragically, was hard to forge during his life, and has the potential to marginalise the extremist fringe. Rabbi John Levi, at the memorial service in Melbourne at the Synagogue of the Hebrew Congregation, made the point that never from the time of King David to the present day had such an assemblage of world leaders come together in Jerusalem—and they did so to honour a great leader who gave his life for peace.

Everyone was moved by the condolence speeches of Rabbi Freilich and Rabbi Bleefeld and by the condolence speech of the President of the Council of WA Jewry, Doron Ur.

It was all the more painful a tragedy that his assassin was a young Jewish man poisoned with the curse of the modern Middle East; that is, a malevolent and belligerent political fundamentalism. This form of malevolent behaviour usually manifests itself first in extreme political language.

It is a terrible fact that Yitzhak Rabin was, and still is in some perverted and evil quarters, the object of such extreme and hateful language. Not long before he was assassinated, his body was burned in effigy. He was called a Nazi, a traitor and a murderer by his more extreme political opponents.

One of the reasons I am over here is the Box Hill tax speech and our success in destroying it. And the same in 1990. And the same in 1993. They know who did them the damage in 1987. One thing about the professionalism of public life is that you know when you have been hurt and you know who hurt you. And he knows who hurt him, who kept him over there.

         Whatever the Leader of the Opposition thinks of Bob Hawke and Bill Kelty, they believed in at least one thing: that you could have a cooperative arrangement between the government and the work force. When that notion was first put about, it was in an economic crisis generated by this man. We had industrial disputation at record levels, we had 11 per cent inflation and the most strike-prone country we had ever seen. That is what we had. That was the legacy.

         One of the great pleasures I had in this parliament was with Bob Hawke doing those things: opening the Australian economy up; giving us the competitiveness we today enjoy; opening up the exchange markets; opening up the financial markets—all the things that this person said he wanted to do but never had the courage to do. He can sling off at Bob Hawke, but I went to a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting a week or so ago and Nelson Mandela was there, very much as a consequence of the policies of this government; had it been the policies of John Howard, he would not have been there.

The opposition's policy has been that, if you take the contract, you are entitled to more money than if you take the award.

That is where they stubbed their toes, and that is where the unions came in. Mr Speaker, on this side of the House we argue there should be no discrimination.

         So, in the election campaign, when you hear John Howard say, `We will give you a choice', you will know there will be no choice; you will know what he will have is a gutting of the commission, that there will be no support for unionists and, basically, they will be at the prey of individual companies—a la Victoria, a la Western Australia. Then, whenever you hear a Liberal Party leader say, as Richard Court said, `We won't be like Victoria', and then become just like Victoria, and when you hear the federal opposition say, `We won't be like Western Australia', let me assure you, Mr Speaker, they would be just like Western Australia. In other words, working people would cop the lot from the coalition as they gave them no choice and set up the conditions to hop into their wages.

         Mr Speaker, all this dispute has done is bring that into sharp relief. What it has made clear is that a Howard-led opposition will basically stab the commission in the stomach; it will remove it from the process; it will in fact favour discrimination in favour of contracts against awards; it will get the unions out of the sites, and then it will comply in pulling wages down. That is their policy, Mr Speaker, and the dispute served the purpose of at least exposing them.

         —The coalition's vote against the privatisation of Sydney airport and the other airports will be a defining moment in John Howard's leadership of the opposition. This is the person who has told us that the country needs more micro-economic reform. This is the person who has told us that the third runway in Sydney should have been built. This is the person who said, `All this scare talk about noise is an exaggeration. I have lived there.' This is the person who consistently pressed the government to build it. He is out there telling the business community that we need more micro-economic reform, and, in the principal micro-economic reform of airport services in this country—that is, the privatisation of them, their capital adequacy, the addition to capacity—he has held it hostage. For what reason? Because he has got a thin margin in his own seat—because of his own miserable seat.

But, at the first whiff of grapeshot, there he goes for the smother. But worse than that—displaying his weakness in the House—he then has the Senate vote against the measures, which has delayed the process of the privatisation and which, of course, will cost the budget an enormous amount of revenue next year.

         There was only one view here, and that was the view from the headland of Bennelong. The headland speech was a speech of political cowardice, a speech of political opportunism and was basically about trying to put a smokescreen over the fact that he stood for this change and now thinks that, because he did, he might lose his seat. This is a person who believes that he can become Prime Minister of Australia but who is transfixed upon holding his own seat. Apparently in his private conversation he is besotted by this fact that he might lose his own seat.

         That means on either end of the east-west runway, were the government to agree and turn over all the safety considerations, we would have many more people affected by the configuration of the airport runways at Mascot. There will be a huge increase in people affected by noise. He does not mind that, because he has given those electorates up. So, as far as he is concerned, they can cop the noise and the rest of us can cop the lack of safety from a runway intersecting with the flight paths of two parallel runways.

         Let us place this on the record: it is one thing to have an obscurantist view of these things after having advocated them; it is another thing to be completely destructive and wilful about it, by then using numbers in another chamber to up-end this process of privatisation in a way that robs the budget of the revenues it needs and that robs the airport process of the capital it needs to continue to expand. This has been done for one shabby and weak purpose only—to try to improve his vote in the seat of Bennelong. The view from the headland of Bennelong is what has promoted this shabby, paltry and unprincipled exercise in the hands of John Howard and the Senate. The people of New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Australia generally should note the fact that, whenever he talks about principle in public life or micro-economic reform or standing for things that matter, what he means is that he will stand only for that which is opportune.

In the end, I think the company realised that it was in the untenable position, having been exposed to the jurisdictional judgment of the arbitration commission and a full bench, of knowing that the notion of unequal work for equal pay was not sustainable. As a consequence, the commission's view prevailed and it ordered a return to work. The order was obeyed and the strike was settled.

         This makes even more important the presence of the commission in this structure and indicates why the Leader of the Opposition's view that he will stab it in the stomach will simply take it from the process and these workers would only be defended by industrial action and the country would return to the conflict model that it had when John Howard was the Treasurer—590 working days lost per thousand compared with 70 working days lost per thousand under this government.

         Under a coalition government without the commission this dispute would only be settled by raw power displayed by, on the one hand, the company, and the trade unions on the other. The government has an obligation and a duty to see that the economy functions properly and we were not going to see the country disadvantaged by either side in the dispute—not Comalco, CRA, the ACTU or the CFMEU. Quite properly, the Minister for Industrial Relations engaged the president of the arbitration commission at a time when it became very obvious that the company and the unions were not going to agree between themselves. The company was still pressing words in its four-point agreement around the question of unequal work for equal pay and the union would not abide that.

         As a consequence the dispute, which was likely to be settled earlier when the managing director was involved, broke down as other company functionaries had their tuppence worth in the resolution of it. When that was obvious, the Minister for Industrial Relations and myself didn't bother with any further conversations with the parties, but the minister appropriately spoke to the President of the Industrial Relations Commission, President O'Connor. She brought the compulsory conference on, and the dispute was settled. The process took over and the process delivered the industrial harmony that we have had for most of the last 13 years.

The proposals received very warm support on Sydney radio yesterday afternoon from none other than the Leader of the Opposition. I might say that this is the same Leader of the Opposition whose bombing raid on Sydney only this week involved the great private member's bill that allows for 24-hour uninterrupted operations on the east-west runway without a curfew—the same private member's bill that described the eastern approaches as the western approaches and the western approaches as the eastern approaches. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who this week, by using and abusing his numbers in the Senate in blocking the government's airport leasing legislation, has significantly delayed the construction of Badgerys Creek airport and thus denied relief for those living in the approaches to Sydney airport.

         But it is his latest effort yesterday that is absolutely the coup de grace. I can advise the House that Airservices Australia has analysed the FAIRA and TALOW proposals which the Leader of the Opposition yesterday described as `intelligently put together'. Indeed, he went further than that. He said they were being entertained by Airservices Australia at his instigation—that he had personally intervened and was ensuring that these proposals were going forward. Depending on the premise you start with, they may have been intelligently put together, but Airservices Australia have intelligently taken them apart. By holding them out as a solution, the only person who fails the intelligence test is the Leader of the Opposition.

         Let me deal first with the TALOW proposal which involves nose-to-nose southerly operations over Botany Bay at all times. That means a plane going out and a plane coming in directly towards each other. Real bright! This may well be a noble objective but, unfortunately, to operate it safely you have reduced the airport's movement rate to about 20. You get about 20 movements out of the airport using that configuration. Given that the peak demand is 65, and is rising at times to over 80 per hour, you can imagine what that means. You don't have to be a genius to work out that it means huge delays at Kingsford Smith airport.

         Then there is the FAIRA proposal which favours the confining of take-offs to the east and the west and landings from the south. Airservices Australia has released a statement, which I would be happy to table with the leave of the House. It has advised that, by confining take-offs to the one runway, we would not meet the movement rates that are required and it would involve a concentration of complex arrival and departure cross-overs in a small area to the east of the airport. Indeed, Airservices Australia categorically rejects the proposals and reaffirms its view that, from safety and capacity perspectives, parallel runway operations are the preferred operating environment at the airport and, wherever possible, airport operations are designed to avoid intersecting runways and reduce possible conflicts in air space around airports.

Is that the reason why today I have received from the union a copy of the state branch of the ACTU of South Australia's election strategy plan campaign, a document which outlines the trade unions' campaign strategy for the next election? Is the Prime Minister involved in these grubby plans, as indicated in the document, which the trade union bosses themselves have called `a campaign of fear and loathing'?

         —Yes—$7 million. I don't think we talk about honesty of politics, honesty of purpose or the rights of people to campaign when the opposition's supporters are all undeclared and hidden, and all we see are the raw numbers of $7 million—and we do not know what the contributions are for. At least with the trade unions, you know where they are coming from. They want the right to collectively bargain and they want the right to organise themselves on an enterprise bargaining basis with a safety net for those who cannot avail themselves of an increase under the enterprise bargaining system. That is the way we are seeing industrial relations develop.

         The Minister for Industrial Relations has told the House repeatedly about the level of coverage under the federal award. I think just on 60 per cent of all employees covered by a federal award are under an enterprise bargain. We are starting to see very strong productivity as a result of that enterprise bargaining system. That is one of the things that has kept the inflation rate down and has seen real wages and profits rise. So high productivity is being shared between profits and wages but is protecting the inflation rate. That is the way any sensible labour market should operate.

         But you opposite are about something different altogether. You want to get people to be just on their own, their single selves, dealing with a company or an employer and, if they do not like what is offered to them, they can get out. That is the model you want; you want the American model. The thing that has never seemed to dawn on you is that even though there have been falling real wages in America for years as the American Secretary of Labor lamented some months ago, the economy still has a two to 2 1/2 per cent speed limit. It has not improved the flexibility of the American economy. It has not added to its supply capacity whatsoever. As a consequence, all you have is an army of working poor.

         I gave the figures in the House recently. Seventy-five per cent of the increment of American wealth in the last decade went to the top three per cent of the population. That is the model they want. The model we want is one where there is an equitable division of the national wealth coming through a properly operating enterprise bargaining system. We have an accord; it is all out there in public. It has the safety nets, the dates and the amounts. Everything the government stands for is out there, written down in the documents for all the public to see and understand.

         That is what John Howard stands for. I have said it before and I will say it again. I cannot understand how a person who comes from such modest circumstances is so interested in belting into working Australians. I cannot understand why he is interested in ripping into the wages and conditions of ordinary Australians, who need this public process for decent wage determination and fairness and equity in the labour market. He has never stood for these things. The government has happily always stood for them. As a consequence, we have a far more cohesive society than the United States, Great Britain or other countries where these sort of policies of the opposition have been tried. As a consequence, we have low inflation, rising real wages and the lowest level of industrial disputes since 1940.

         It is that sort of model which Australia has really always needed. I am sure that many Australian companies and managers now understand how the model operates. They look and wince at the Comalcos of this world who are screwing the model up and putting the whole model at risk. What they all know quite obviously—they tell us—is that if the opposition were to govern Australia we would be back to industrial mayhem and falling real wages. They know what that means. There would not be strikes for a couple of days; you would have them for years all across the country. There would be thousands of Comalcos all across the country. It is a foretaste of what is to come from a coalition government.

         We now have organised companies whose specialist job is simply to run a clutch of radio stations.

         In the aggregated zones, we had monopolies with local country newspapers. The ownership of television stations is going to groups like Prime Television and others. We are now seeing a substantial diversification in the media. That diversification was threatened when some people thought that they could move beyond the 15 per cent level of ownership and own television and newspapers in the same city. The government supports the principle of media diversity. Last year, it proposed measures to buttress and strengthen the cross-media rules by placing on them an upper limit of 15 per cent in the Broadcasting Services Act.

         I am pleased to note that those measures were passed by the Senate on Tuesday, 21 November and will provide certainty to the issue of media ownership by setting in concrete that 15 per cent. But the opposition says that it believes in diversity of media ownership. Senator Alston has mouthed platitudes declaring that the principles underpinning media policy should be competition, plurality, diversity and the national interest. But what does he do? He votes against the 15 per cent limit which is put there to bring certainty to the cross-media limits, to guarantee the very plurality and diversity he is speaking of. The Leader of the Opposition in 1991 signed a petition which said:

It stands against the principles of competition, plurality, diversity and the national interest. It stands in favour of preference, as it always has. It was no accident under 23 years of coalition government that the

        I find it remarkable that the public accept the conduct of royal commissions as a means of obtaining evidence, bearing in mind that our forebears revolted against the Star Chamber, which was a standing royal commission of its day. Press and politicians alike seem quite anxious to call for royal commissions in all manner of activities, not pausing to consider that the powers of a royal commission are easily abused. Indeed, the public spectacle of witnesses squirming under questioning by the Commissioner or by his Assisting Council provides dramatic copy for the daily press to the delectation of many of its readers.

        What an apt description of this putrid commission in Western Australia. In the release of this, we had this question of the contact between the Western Australian government and the commission. When Richard Court was pressed on this question late in the afternoon of 21 November, he admitted that his consultant, Richard Elliott, met commission staff prior to the start of public hearings, despite his earlier blanket denials and his claim on 9 May that the royal commission was completely independent of the government. It should be noted that page 12 of the royal commission's report says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commission did not conduct any private hearings.
       </para>
       <para>
        This turns out to be untrue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The commission refused to disclose to Dr Lawrence's lawyers any details of communications as to the subject matter of the inquiry from Court or anyone on his behalf; the government; the Liberal or National parties; Richard Elliott; or Barbara Campbell. This is the important point:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Attempts by Dr Lawrence's lawyers to cross-examine Court on contact between his staff and the commission were curtailed by Commissioner Marks on the objection of Counsel Assisting.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, when Dr Lawrence's counsel attempted to ask Premier Richard Court in this commission whether there had been contact between his staff and the commission, the questions were curtailed by the commissioner. Richard Court said earlier:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A number of officers from the Ministry of the Premier and Cabinet, including members of the Premier's staff, have had discussions with officers of the royal commission. Such discussions ranged from housekeeping matters relating to the administrative arrangements of the royal commission, through to interviews conducted by investigators, responding to requests for information and appearing before the commission under subpoena. Given the number of people involved and the frequency of contact with officers of the commission both by telephone and in person, it is not possible to identify all such discussions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Would some appropriate questioning in the commission by counsel not have been a way of eliciting what advice had gone to the commission, what role there had been and whether Mr Court's political staff had briefed the royal commission before the hearings began? This allegation had been repeated, of course, in the federal parliament on 21 November and 22 November. In the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         West Australian
        </emphasis>
        on 21 November Mr Court denied there had been any liaison between his office and Mr Marks or Ms Vanstone in the lead-up. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Dr Lawrence should stop making false claims.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 6PR he was asked by Mr Sattler:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        So are you saying she just made this up too?

       </para>
       <para>
        But, when pressed, he had to say that his consultant, Richard Elliott, had met commission staff prior to the start of the public hearings. This gives you some idea of why Sir Garfield Barwick made the reference he did. Then in the documents attached to the commission we find that the royal commissioner wrote to the Clerk of Journals of the House of Commons `to secure some authority about the status of rulings made by the President of the Western Australian Legislative Council'. He wrote to the Clerk of Journals. He did not make a reference to Australian parliamentary practice. The response was:

        What a glum set of replies from the Clerk of Journals in the House of Commons to this lackey of the Western Australian government, who was not prepared to consult Australian parliamentary practice but wanted some authority for the rulings of the Western Australian president of the upper house. When the Western Australian clerk of the upper house gave his testimony and said that it would have been highly improper for Dr Lawrence or any other member of parliament to stop a petitioner petitioning the chamber, that was completely ignored in the weight of evidence by this hired gun of a commissioner.

         The reason why Sir Garfield Barwick made those remarks is because of the way these things are conducted. The reason the Clerk of Journals of the committee of privileges said, `Royal commissions for investigative purposes are no longer the fashion in the UK' is for that very same point. They are simply a cat's paw of the executive. That is why they are used. What has happened here is this royal commission's terms of reference were restrictive, which Mr Marks admits himself.

        No, you see, because between the time I asked the first question on the week prior to that on Tuesday, 24 November, when I asked the second series of questions relating to the same subject, I'd spoken to Penny Easton who reiterated the information she had with respect to the $200,000 payment was in fact correct. So that's why I put the questions again, and she was quite adamant about it and I recalled her being quite adamant in her very gentle fashion, that the information she received and passed on to me was right.

         It is a disgrace. It is one of the low points of Australian public life. Never before has the viciousness of the coalition been expressed against an individual person. And now, Mr Speaker, they want to deny paying the fees for her representation in the process. Mr Speaker, this is the opposition at its worst. This is the Liberal Party at its worst.

         —In particular, if you compare what happened to key economic trends under this government with those that occurred when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country, one sees absolutely startling differences in the outcomes. Let us take economic growth. The average rate of economic growth during the period when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer was 2.6 per cent per annum and, under this government, it has been 3 1/2 per cent per annum. That 0.9 per cent might not sound like much to start with but, year after year, over 12 years, 0.9 per cent becomes a hell of a lot of additional GDP. In fact, it is worth $50 billion more.

         When we look at employment, the rate of employment growth under the previous government whilst the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer was 0.8 per cent per annum. Under us, it has been 2.3 per cent—almost three times the rate of employment growth. What does that mean in terms of additional jobs? It means that we have 1.3 million more jobs today than if we had had the rate of employment growth under the previous Treasurer. That means that if we had not had those additional jobs, the unemployment rate today would be 23 per cent if we continued the 0.8 per cent rate of employment growth under the previous government. So one can see a spectacular change in employment outcomes, and Australia is far better off in employment respects under this government.

If Mr Howard's rate of inflation had continued since 1983, prices today would be 70 per cent higher—not 17 but 70 per cent higher—today than they actually are.

It is 12 months since I first raised the issue of your government's complicity in the Victorian City Link project through the provision of tax concessions on infrastructure bonds. You have belatedly weighed into the issue, accusing Jeff Kennett of being uncivilised—I do not disagree with that—and of herding and funnelling people into tollways in the interests of his mates. He has responded by asking you to put up or shut up. Can you now confirm that your government will withhold tax concessions for this disastrous project? Furthermore, will you give an unequivocal undertaking to apply the same conditions to the state ALP's equally outrageous freeway widening proposal? Finally, if you are vehemently opposed to tollways, why are you prepared to fund them?

These are the things that are purely an accountant's view of budgetary responsibilities without any sense of the big picture and without any sense of the obligations to a community which a government takes on upon its election. That seems to be completely misunderstood in Victoria.

The extension of Adelaide airport is what South Australians had been wanting and crying out for years for. But just when the dream is about to become a reality, the Leader of the Opposition snatches it away. We have seen today Dean Brown trying desperately to cover for John Howard, but privately he has been devastated by this decision. He has every right to be devastated.

         From the Commonwealth's point of view, we are not able to enter into any major contract commitments until the budgetary provisions are secured via the leasing process—that, after all, is where the money comes from.

         Since the leasing of the airports has been blocked, the total of $44 million that has been allocated for this project from the leasing proceeds is not available until that legislation goes through the parliament—until the Senate pass it. There is no hope of that happening, by the look of things, until after the next election. And if John Howard controls the Senate after the next election, it will never go through; just as we will never get a second airport for Sydney because it is funded in exactly the same way.

        I believe that the standing orders should be suspended for one very simple reason: today the government has followed a very deliberate pattern of filibustering its way through question time. Everybody here, everybody in the press gallery, and anybody throughout Australia who follows politics, knows very well that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has not been present at question time for the last four weeks. This is his first appearance in parliament for four weeks. What does he do? He sets out on a deliberate pattern of filibustering the government's way through question time—of deliberately giving excessively and unnecessarily long answers, thinking that at the end of the day either the opposition will lose interest in moving a censure motion or all those who report the news—particularly on commercial television at 5 and 6 o'clock—will think it is too late to cover anything at all to do with a censure motion.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This is another aspect of the lengths to which the government will go to deny accountability before the parliament. It must be absolutely unprecedented for a Prime Minister to walk out while a censure motion is being moved against him. That man—the Neville Chamberlain of Australian industrial relations: good old peace in our lunch time—had the nerve to say in question time that the Liberal Party defiled and opposed every great institution in Australia. The ultimate democratic institution of Australia is the parliament of Australia, and the House of Representatives, I thought, more than any other place, was, in the eyes of the Labor Party, the great clearing house of public conflict in Australia. The Prime Minister himself has said, `It all ends up here. This is where you've got to stand up and be counted. This is where your mettle is demonstrated.'

They orchestrated dorothy dixers and, at the end of the day, when the opposition moved a censure motion, in a quite unprecedented fashion the Prime Minister walked out.

The television cameras of the living rooms of Australia are not trained on us at the moment, but they will be trained on that debate. Paul Keating can skulk out of parliament this afternoon, he can run from accountability before the bar of public opinion and he can run away from the fact that he did not have the guts to do to Carmen Lawrence what Gough Whitlam had the guts to do to Rex Connor, what Bob Hawke had the guts to do to John Brown, and what any decent postwar Prime Minister would have had the guts to do to somebody who had been publicly discredited as a public liar not only before the parliament of Western Australia but also before the National Press Club.

He wimps out of the House. He runs out of the parliament saying, `Oh, I'll do it on Monday.' I can tell the Prime Minister that we certainly will do it on Monday. I tell you what, we'll do it on Tuesday. Oh, we can't do it on Tuesday because that is his rostered day off. That is right, he has to have a little rest on Tuesday. He also has to have a nice little rest on Wednesday so that he can get his strength up for Thursday to answer a few questions. When there is a censure motion he will run out of the House again.

There was no conspiracy between Richard Court and Jim McGinty and Ian Taylor and Eric Ripper and John Kobelke and Keith Wilson and Pam Beggs and Judith Watson and all the other people, totalling 14.

He admitted today that Jim McGinty had told him months ago, before the royal commission was set up, that she was wrong and that everybody else who was present was going to give testimony to that effect. What did he then do? Firstly, he concealed that knowledge from the Australian public. Maybe they had the meeting at Kirribilli House; they probably did. He concealed the information from the Australian public. Then, with the knowledge that she was wrong, 14 to 15, he set about traducing the reputation of Kenneth Marks.

         —I rise to second the motion and point out to the House that this is the moment, at this stage of the parliamentary sitting week, when the House should put aside all other business to discuss the censure motion laid down by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). Why? Because at the bar of the parliament no-one is above that, not the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and not even the former member for Canberra. Remember Ros Kelly? The Prime Minister had to twist and turn and defend and twist and turn and defend; yet, at the end of the day, there was no choice for the member for Canberra. She had to resign. She was ultimately pushed, shoved, resigned, sacked out of that portfolio because she had failed in her duties to the parliament, failed in her duties and responsibilities as a minister of the Crown, failed with regard to the conduct of her portfolio. She was held accountable to this parliament in a way which I cheerfully remind this government this day, this moment. They might like to reflect on the fact as they go into this weekend interruption to the sittings and contemplate all that they might try to produce in defence of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) next week.

         But it was not only the member for Canberra. It was under the prime ministership of Mr Keating that none other than the member for Maribyrnong, Mr Alan Griffiths, likewise took action on a particular Sunday to resign because he recognised that there were matters to be investigated. He recognised that it was the proper course of action. He recognised the due ethic which should apply in a parliamentary sense. So it was that he fell on his sword and departed his ministerial portfolio under the prime ministership of Mr Keating.

         The point is very clear cut: there is no more serious and important motion to be put before the House than that of censure. Suspension and censure should take priority and should be taken on by the government right now, this Thursday, at 4.40 p.m., even after an extensive and extended question time. It goes to the issue of the integrity of the Minister for Human Services and Health. As the Leader of the Opposition has correctly said, the evidence that flowed from eight former ministers and from senior staffers was not the product of members of the Liberal or National parties, nor was it the product of liaison, consultation, request or approach in any other way from anybody on this side of politics. It was the cold-hearted action, on reflection, of each of the individuals involved.

         I salute one in particular of those individuals. I salute again today Carmel Lawrence's deputy in the Western Australian state parliament, Ian Taylor. That deputy had to wrestle with his conscience and with his political mates. He holds the difficult seat of Kalgoorlie. He came down to Perth and decided, at the end of the day, that he would put his hand up and give evidence that the recollections of the Minister for Human Services and Health were wrong. I know that Ian Taylor is in political opposition to me. I do not know him well. On flights to Perth and back you end up sitting next to a wide range of people and on one occasion I was seated next to him.

         What is the basis of the censure motion that you want to move? It is about the failure of the Prime Minister to disclose that he had been told by the Western Australian Labor leader that his minister's claims were wrong. The answer was obviously pointed out to you during question time. You clearly are not flexible, because I thought that you would have changed the terms of reference of your censure motion lickety-split after you were presented with the answer by the Prime Minister at that time. He made amply clear that he had been informed by the minister at the time that there were differing recollections of that set of events.

I thought you would have looked at them before you extended the ultimate arm of credibility to this royal commission. What you have had revealed to you today were persistent denials by the Western Australian Premier—it was a level of denial which caused questions not to be able to be asked before the royal commission about the briefing he may have received from his staff—that have now been overturned.

         Recollect the surprise when one contrary witness after another—there was very little capacity to test them—was lined up against Carmen Lawrence in that royal commission. A few people scratched their heads and said, `Hang on a tick. Is there a bit of due process here and connivance between the royal commission and any part of the political process in Western Australia?' Isn't that a bit of a surprise? At the time, it was said that there was no connivance between the Premier's office and the political process and the royal commission.

         Yesterday, the Premier of Western Australia had to face up to his differing recollections. Previously, he had allowed slide the view that of course he had had nothing to do with advising the royal commission. His political office stood pure in it. Any communications had been purely about administrative matters and purely between officials of the relevant department and the royal commission. He says that political office was not involved. His chief political operator, Richard Elliott, made so many phone calls that the commission could not count them. The commission has a bit of a recollection problem. It cannot even recall the number of phone calls between the political office of the Premier and the royal commission, and therefore cannot detail them. Bully for them.

         You can have that log rolling operation in Western Australia, but do not expect us to respect it. Do not expect us to respect it when that lying, misleading and deceit from the Premier of Western Australia is the basis on which this royal commission was set up. When very relevant questioning on that point was issued by counsel for Dr Lawrence, it was shut off. There was not one word about it. They could not proceed down that road. This situation in relation to the affairs of the Eastons and the Campbells had been like a cricket match as far as the opposition was concerned. It was two or three years before the matters were finally raised by somebody on the Labor side of the House.

The two parties then go before the commission, which they refused to do before, the case is put before the commission, the national strike is called off and the resolution is put forward.

         The motion also states that the Prime Minister has an inability to insist on the truth from those around him. I could go into detail on that through the opposition. All I need to do is refer to Senator Macdonald's famous quote, the first instance of a detailed revelation of Liberal Party internal planning. What is it? Liberal Party internal planning reveals it has a whole set of propositions up. It says it will make much of them for all these public works but will never do any of them. It will mislead the Australian people on its intent, and John Howard says, `I don't have a liar behind me.' I suppose it is literally true, he is in the stink.

         —Last week in the Marks royal commission in Perth we heard of the untruthful behaviour of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) arising from the so-called Penny Easton affair. This week we heard debate in this place on government proposals to fund the minister's substantial legal fees associated with that royal commission. Only in the last hour we have debated the minister's credibility.

         Regrettably, I have to report another dimension to that lack of credibility of the minister involving a recent case of medical treatment of one of my constituents. It is clear to my constituent that Dr Lawrence's untruthful behaviour revealed by Commissioner Marks is now matched by the ideologically driven attitude of her office and her department to the health problems of ordinary battlers.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Consistently, in debates in this place and in her public utterances, Dr Lawrence has set out to play down the merits of private health insurance, to beat up the infallibility of Medicare and the public health system, to put many doctors in a collective category as excessive chargers of their services or to bag the avaricious nature of the AMA. Dr Lawrence's office in particular has a persistence for politics over portfolio, and my constituent's problem proves the point.

         Last week I was faced both with a practical example of some of the serious shortcomings of Dr Lawrence's present health system and with the political emphasis of Dr Lawrence's office and her department rather than with their genuine interest in the health care problems of a distraught local housewife threatening suicide. The lady involved, who was diagnosed with degenerative spondylosis over five years ago, has been forced to pay nearly $90,000 out of her own pocket in that time to meet hospital and medical bills, despite medical insurance. More expense is likely, possibly in the order of $15,000 of personal liability, as a result of further operations in the near future.

         To meet these financial commitments, she and her average income police sergeant husband have been forced into bank loans and further financial stress. Personal family relationships are at a breaking point. The extent of their financial liability results from a combination of factors, such as the unrealistic schedule fees determined by the government under Medicare arrangements, the increasing gap between Medicare refunds and consultancy or service charges, the outpatient inadequacies of Medicare arrangements and the unfortunate tendency of some doctors to charge substantially above the schedule fee or AMA recommended level—although in this case I have to say that the specialist concerned is continuing to carry the lady's large debt.

         However, it is the negative attitude of Dr Lawrence's office and her department to the specific problem that has caused deep despair to this couple, who came to see me only last week. When my electorate office phoned Dr Lawrence's Canberra office early last week seeking urgent advice in light of the lady's suicidal tendencies, her staff were just not interested. `If she is a private patient, we can't help,' was the general reaction, and they referred my office to the department.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Although the department conceded that it was one of the worst cases brought to their attention, the blame was shifted quickly to ideological criticisms of private health insurance and the lack of Commonwealth power over doctors' fees. In a nutshell, the simplistic, unhelpful attitude was: the lady would have been better off as a public patient where the problem would not have arisen. This is patently untrue, as Queensland public hospital queues will attest.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         A very disturbing additional dimension to the problem was a suggestion that the couple might separate so that the lady could claim the invalid pension. So much for the government's infallible Medicare arrangements and its unequivocal social awareness. Clearly, there is a big difference between the Commonwealth paying the legal fees of Dr Lawrence and a genuine desire to assist this desperate lady—and many like her—under Medicare arrangements which remain inadequate.

         My concern is for the lady's welfare, as indeed it is incumbent on Dr Lawrence to be just as concerned.

         —Some 12 to 14 months ago, I, along with a number of my colleagues from Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales, joined together to form the fair share task force to fight for an increase in tertiary places for Queensland. It is well known to this House that Queensland had not been getting its fair allocation of tertiary places and that universities in western Sydney and in Western Australia had also not been getting their fair share of places allocated by federal funds. So we formed the fair share task force and took our case to the federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean.

         The minister was very responsive to our case and understood that there was a need for a redress in the balance of distribution of places. He undertook to do what he could in the budget to try to find the extra funding for those tertiary places. We spent some months working with the minister to try to find ways in which we could find those additional tertiary places. It was a great joy to Queenslanders, particularly those Queensland families that have young people leaving year 12 this year, to find that in the budget the federal government was able to find measures to achieve additional funding so that Queensland could get an additional 4,200 extra places. What that extra allocation meant was that Queensland students were going to get their fair share and that young Queenslanders were going to get the opportunity to go to university and to achieve their full potential.

         It now appears that all of that has been placed in jeopardy. Liberal and National Party members and senators have worked to try to stop this from happening. I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that I will be going out and about throughout my electorate and the state of Queensland telling the young people that the members of the Liberal and National parties in Queensland do not want them to have a place in higher education. Those members have worked in this parliament to stop young people from going to university. This is their commitment to higher education. This is how they demonstrate their commitment to young people. They are trying to starve the universities of funds.

Liberal Party and National Party senators should hang their heads in shame. I will be making sure that the Liberal Senate team going into the 1996 election—Senator Herron and Senator Ian Macdonald—are made to account for the way in which they have acted in relation to this legislation.

         How can members of the Liberal and National parties dare to look year 12 students in their electorates in the face? I went and visited every year 12 student in my electorate and I committed myself to work to get extra university places. I will continue to do that. Members of the Liberal and National parties have no credibility and no integrity when it comes to caring about young people and families when they are willing to act in such a disgraceful and destructive way. They have cut funds that will provide for extra university places in Queensland. It is an absolute shame. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame.

The bill has already been through this House. There is a real risk that the bill will not be processed before Christmas.

         It will deny a major industry in my electorate the opportunity to effectively retail and make available to Australians the therapeutic goods that it manufactures. The company affected is the Brauer company which has a processing factory in the Barossa Valley. The Brauer family came to the Barossa Valley as part of the German settlement movement in the 1840s. The Brauers were associated with pharmaceutical goods production and processing in the Barossa Valley. In 1972 they went into production of their own homeopathic medicines.

         The Brauers have been at the cutting edge of homoeopathic research and the retailing of homoeopathic goods across Australia and, in 1987, were the recipients of the Lady Cilento Award for the production of homoeopathic medicines. They are now in the situation of having several new products that they wish to list, that they have indicated they have been processing and that they wish to market. The products have met all the various standards that are required by Australian legislation. The fact that the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill is still waiting, unprocessed through the Senate, means that they cannot list these new products on the marketplace. As a result, their managing director, Mr Mark Wuttke, tells me that since 1 July this year he has had to place four full-time people out of the work force, two other jobs are currently at risk and they estimate they have lost over $150,000 in sales.

         The absurdity of this is that the legislation is not legislation that the opposition has opposed. It is legislation that the government has introduced and the opposition supports it. But it has not received the necessary prior rating in the processing of legislation through the Senate for me or this company to feel confident that it will be passed by the end of next week. If it does not become law, the losses that the company is currently sustaining will continue. That would be absurd when there is nothing that the company is doing that is counter to the law and there is nothing that the opposition has done that has frustrated the government in this exercise. It is urgent that those managing government business in the Senate recognise that this legislation ought to have prior treatment in the interests of not only this company but also all those involved in pharmaceutical goods manufacture and the manufacture of homoeopathic medicines across Australia.

         —This evening I would like to speak about one of the most successful initiatives ever initiated by any government in Australia. I refer to the national aged care system that operates in this country, whereby licensed beds for nursing homes and hostels are issued by the Department of Human Services and Health and those positions are subsidised. By the issue of this seeding capital and the guarantee that there will be a bed available for a frail aged person, if this is correctly managed it can become a major business, a major employer, in many country towns.

         A little over a week ago I had the pleasure of attending the annual general meeting of the Dungog Nursing Home. This is a 20-bed hostel and a 20-bed nursing home complex. It was built in 1989. At that time I was serving as a councillor on Dungog Shire Council. It was built with the aid of a $1 million grant from the federal government. Today that nursing home-hostel not only provides top quality accommodation for 40 frail aged people but also provides 38 jobs in a small rural town. It has accumulated property and has assets worth $3 million. The phenomenal success that this organisation has enjoyed has resulted in its acquiring land and building eight self-care units, with another four to be constructed. As a result of being given $1 million five years ago, this organisation now has three tiers of aged care available and employs people at the same time.

In five short years I am sure the whole committee believe that their plan has succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.

Assisting the full-time staff are people enrolled in the local skillshare projects. I know that there is an opinion held by some members opposite that these training programs often only play at training and do not lead to a real job, but in this case they are definitely providing a major service to members of the community and they will lead to jobs because this is an expanding industry. Some of these staff provide tuition to these students.

         The nursing home has also been involved in many other community projects such as Greening Australia in conjunction with the LEAP project involving school children and the long-term unemployed. This pattern of aged care is repeated in many towns. I am sure that representatives here from rural and regional electorates know exactly what I am talking about because it is repeated there and it is very successful. In the electorate of Paterson we have outstanding community support in towns such as Gloucester, Stroud, Bulahdelah, Hawkesnest, Maitland, Tenilba Bay and Nelson Bay. All of these places have nursing homes, hostels or both. Each is subsidised by the federal government, each providing quality accommodation and care and, more importantly, creating jobs.

The subsidy we give is compensated by the jobs that are created and these are often in towns where traditional industries have disappeared and where the opportunity for job creation is minimal. I would urge all members of this House to support this great system.

         —I rise to speak in the adjournment debate tonight to voice my concern for the 4,500 newsagents of Australia who I believe are subject to attack because of, perhaps, an aberration in the application of our new competition policy. I believe that while we must have competition—there is no doubt about that—it has to be leavened with a degree of sanity. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which is the old Trade Practices Commission—still chaired by professor Allan Fels, by the way—appears to be too focused on the theory of competition rather than the reality. I do not think they can see the wood for the trees. While they obviously want to get a better deal for consumers—and so does everybody in this place—we have to be concerned about the fabric and the structure which provide that service to the consumers. That fabric and structure involves the 4,500 newsagents operating around Australia.

         We have to be concerned about what might occur, which would be the removal of the delivery monopoly and other benefits enjoyed by newsagents. Instead of bringing about a better system for the sale and delivery of newspapers and magazines, removing, revoking or modifying the current authorisations could leave both newsagencies and public arrangements in disarray. The Trade Practices Commission, I believe, needs to finalise its very longwinded decisions as quickly as possible. It is worth noting that the Fraser government was quoted in the newspapers as saying at that time, which was in 1978-79, that the widespread availability of newspapers and magazines and the low cost home delivery service were the principal public benefit. The point I want to make is that there are public benefits from the current newsagent system. It has certainly worked very successfully in the distribution of newspapers throughout this country.

         The coalition has a very clear perspective on where it stands on this issue. The coalition and I support the continuation of the current system of distribution for newspapers and magazines, with one accredited newsagent for a particular territory. The fact is that the newsagents' network in this country, together with the 25,000 subagents, provides an excellent public service.

         If people are as concerned as the coalition and I about preserving small business, we should realise that putting the products at newsagents increasingly into the Woolworths and the Coles is not going to help small business; it is going to destroy it. It is certainly going to provide a situation where individual small businesses will be pushed out. I can even envisage a situation where there is a major shopping complex with perhaps even 80 shops and if things go the way they seem to be going—it is drawing a long bow—you could end up with Coles at one end, Woolworths at the other end and absolutely nothing in between. I do not think that is appropriate; it is total madness.

         Australia's 4,500 newsagents are located in every significant shopping area right across Australia. They provide face to face service to more than one million customers every day. They represent one of the last bastions of major successful family business enterprise and employ in excess of 20,000 staff. A great many of them are youngsters. If we are concerned about youth unemployment we should remember that businesses like newsagencies do employ young Australians. That, to me, is very important.

         The sector turns over more than $3 billion annually and holds the investment hopes of thousands of Australians who have their life savings in their businesses. If they are to be destroyed, I believe there must be compensation. If the authorisation does have to change, there must be compensation for loss of income and the purchase of goodwill to be included in that authorisation. I support the need for compensation and the purchase of the goodwill. If the axe falls on newsagencies, they should not be treated unfairly but I believe the axe should not fall and the system should be left as it is. It works well and it is for the public benefit. It benefits the people of Australia.

         You then have to look at the affairs of Sergeant Waghorn and Detective Christmass, two officers in the drug squad. They were sent to interview a person who had actually sent Homebake to someone in Carnarvon who had died as a result. This person was interviewed, his premises were searched and he was found to have in his possession the manufacturing equipment. He was clearly in some sort of trouble. This man made a statement and it went to court. In court, the man, Mr O'Halloran, defended himself. It was only natural that he should seek every avenue open to him, and I certainly do not deny him that right. He threw doubt on the validity of the signatures that were on every page of the statement.

         It was in evidence that Sergeant Waghorn had said to him on several occasions, `Will you sign this again?' This matter was raised in the court and it was decided by the magistrate that there had to be some study into whether it was his signature or not. The experts simply could not agree so the guy was acquitted.

         Then, Christmass and Waghorn were once again ex officio indicted by the DPP. They went to the preliminary hearing and it was thrown out. So, once again, they were ex officio indicted and it went to court. This dragged on for two years. When it went to court, O'Halloran, who by this time had got himself off heroin, decided that the honourable thing to do would be to go forward and say, `It was my signature. In all probability I did sign it.'

         The DPP knew this all the time yet it refused to call him as a witness. Had he been called as a witness there would have been no case. The DPP is duty bound to call all the evidence, and it failed to do this. It was prepared to put these two police officers through two years of sheer hell. It cost the families of the officers dearly. In my view, those two officers were doing a great job for the community and were unmercifully harassed.

         The common factors in all this harassment are the Director of Public Prosecutions, John McKechnie, and the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Les Ayton. They are the common factors through all these things, and this is just a handful of matters. I have literally many cases here where the same sort of thing has applied. There has to be some real look at what is happening to justice in Western Australia. If there was ever a need for an inquiry, it is for an additional inquiry into the administration of justice in Western Australia. Such an inquiry is long overdue. If we are to return some dignity and some sense of cohesion and purpose to the police force, we must have an inquiry. Many people in the police force want it. By and large, the police are honourable people.

        I find that rather interesting because the first sign of this development was early in 1994 when a site office was put on site to sell these stores. As a result of that site office being there and my picking up literature that showed there were some 650 stalls, I came into this place on 28 February and in a grievance debate said:

         There will be some 650 stalls at this market site. The total area of the site at the airport will be 27 acres. It will have a car park for some 2,400 cars. Three acres of buildings will accommodate 650 stallholders.

        I went on to say that there were four chambers of commerce in the area which were not supportive of the development. I also said that there was a proposed $216 million expansion at the Southland shopping centre. It would involve massive planning requirements which had not been taken into consideration throughout this process, which was a money grab for market stalls on the side. I also said in my speech that the Victorian Minister for Planning, Mr Rob MacLellan, had threatened to cut road services to the Moorabbin airport—that is nothing light, is it?—if the airport proceeded to hold markets on the site. I said:

        We can go on and on about this process. It just amazes me. In fact, I suspect what we ought to be calling the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) is the fireman for the minister. He is going around prior to the election putting out the fires that exist with some of these developments. We need to remember that there are no planning processes. We do not know anything until the contract is signed, so there is no opportunity for people to complain.

         I raised these issues in this house of parliament. We have had people going out to the site to put out the fire and saying, `Look, if only we'd known something about this, we would have dealt with it. If somebody in the state or local government area had said something, we would have dealt with it.' I came into this federal parliament and said that the local government authorities were upset, that the chambers of commerce were upset and that the state government minister had raised the issue. But we have this cheap exercise on the part of the government. They have gone into the area saying, `Look, if we'd been aware of it, we would have done something about it.'

        The Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1995 proposes amendments in the light of a recent court decision that has jeopardised the viability of the voluntary administration scheme under part 5.3A of the Corporations Law, which commenced operation in June 1993.

         Part 5.3A of the Corporations Law provides a regime for companies to enter voluntary administration as an alternative to liquidation. It is an extremely popular method of dealing with companies in financial difficulty. The scheme allows a company in financial difficulty to enter into a deed of company arrangement with its creditors. This enables the company to continue trading for a period with a view to producing some return for creditors, rather than being wound up immediately.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The advantage of taking this course from a creditor's perspective is that if the company is allowed to continue operating its business, there is a likelihood that a better return to creditors will be obtained than if the company is liquidated immediately. The mechanism also serves to avoid the costs and delays often associated with liquidations.

         Statistics published by the Australian Securities Commission and industry bodies show that the voluntary administration scheme is an increasingly popular means of dealing with corporate financial difficulties. In a significant proportion of cases, companies enter into deeds of company arrangements with their creditors, rather than proceeding directly to winding up, in an effort to save the company or at least its business.

         In some cases, after a period of trading under a deed of company arrangement, it will become apparent that the continued trading of the company will not be successful.

         —The Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1995 is designed to overcome a recent decision of Cohen J in the New South Wales Supreme Court in Re Crawford House Pty Ltd. The decision highlights an unintended anomaly with the voluntary administration provisions of the Corporations Law and adversely affects creditors who deal with a company controlled by directors as distinct from an administrator while under voluntary administration.

         In regard to the background to these administrative provisions, the provisions of the Corporations Law entitled `Administration of a company's affairs with the view to executing a deed of company arrangement', part 5.3A, commenced operation on 23 June 1993. The objects of this part are to provide for an insolvent company to be administered so that the chances of the company continuing in existence are maximised; and, if it is not possible for the company to continue, for a better return to creditors than would result from an immediate winding up.

         Before this part, generally speaking, the only remedy available to a company in trouble was to have it wound up. Other options of a scheme of arrangement or official management, requiring 100 per cent return, were cumbersome and costly. There was, therefore, very little prospect of a potentially viable business being able to continue in existence.

         The Corporate Law Reform Act 1992 inserted a new part 53.A, a scheme for voluntary administration of a company which is in financial difficulties. Through the agreement with creditors, the company can continue to trade under external supervision of the administrator in the hope that it might ultimately trade out of its difficulties. The means by which this is done is under a deed of company arrangement. This has obvious advantages for the directors, shareholders and creditors of the company. It also means that the company can continue to employ people and contribute to the national economy.

         Debts incurred during the operation of the arrangement were thought to be ranked in priority over other unsecured creditors in any winding up. The purpose was to provide an incentive or reward for dealing with a company in difficulties and give it a second chance. Under deeds of company arrangement, it is possible for the creditors to resolve that the administrator not be involved in the carrying out of the business, but the directors of the company be responsible. It was incorrectly assumed by many that the priority in ranking would attract to the debts irrespective of whether the administrator or the directors were carrying out the day-to-day running of the company. However, the Crawford House case held that, due to technical deficiency in the legislation, if debts were incurred by the directors of the company in lieu of the administrator, the debts not only do not rank at all but are not provable.

         In the Crawford House case, this bill before the parliament is needed to overcome this decision. On 13 December 1993, Mr Dean Willcocks was appointed administrator of Crawford House Press Pty Ltd. At that time, the company had creditors whose debts totalled $1,344,299. By 23 December 1993, a creditors meeting had resolved that the administrator should cease to be involved in the actual carrying on of the business of the company, but that the administrator should have certain powers should the company default on the arrangement. It was assumed that the company would continue in business and that the company and not the administrator would incur such debts as were necessary for carrying on the business.

        In relation to the issue of priority of debt incurred by administrators, under the existing legislation, debts incurred prior to a company entering into a deed of company arrangement can be proved in a winding up. However, if a company subsequently enters into a deed of arrangement, then debts incurred by the administrator during the period after the deed has been entered into take priority in any subsequent litigation.

         On the issue of priority and provability of directors' debts, if under a deed the directors of a company are responsible for running the day-to-day affairs of the company then the decision of Crawford House means that not only are debts incurred by the directors without priority but they are not even admissible to prove in any subsequent winding-up. This is because section 513B of the Corporations Law provides a number of alternative dates for the commencement of a winding-up.

         Where, as in the case of Crawford House, the company was under a deed of company arrangement immediately prior to the resolution to wind up the company being passed, the winding-up is taken to have commenced on the day the deed began. The winding up therefore refers back to this earlier date. This earlier date is defined as the relevant date in the Corporations Law. Debts are provable if incurred before the relevant date. For the purposes of admissibility of debts, the date of the deed of company arrangement and the date of liquidation are no longer different dates. The date of liquidation becomes the date the deed of company arrangement was entered into.

         In relation to an exception for administrators, there is, however, a mechanism whereby debts incurred between the commencement of the administration and the winding-up can be proved and have priority. This mechanism is granted to the administrator. After all, the legislation makes the date of liquidation relate back to the date the administration commenced. Any dates incurred after the liquidation cannot be proved. This means debts incurred in an administration would ordinarily, without an exception being provided, neither have priority nor be provable, because they would have been debts incurred after the date of liquidation. Section 556 provides a suitable mechanism by spelling out that a relevant authority has priority during that time, and defining the administration as a relevant authority.

         The government is proposing to amend section 553 of the Corporations Law, which deals with debts or claims that are provable in a winding-up. Its amendment seeks to ensure that all such debts or claims incurred by the directors of the company will be provable. It is important to recognise that the government's bill will not give priority to debts incurred by the directors of the company under a deed of company arrangement. The government's proposal therefore will not reward those creditors who deal with directors of a company rather than an administrator, under a deed of company arrangement.

         What will happen is that, even though the debts are incurred after the relevant date, the time for which such new creditors will be able to prove will be extended to the date of termination of the deed of company arrangement. It is simply seeking to ensure that, where the existing creditors choose to allow the directors to run the company, the debts incurred while under the arrangement are at least provable. They are not seeking to give those debts any priority over other existing unsecured creditors. It treats them as normal unsecured creditors.

         This will have the effect of discouraging creditors from dealing with a company under an arrangement if the directors are in charge.

This is a clear policy decision to create an incentive for existing creditors to allow a costly administrator to take charge of the daily affairs of the company. It creates a disincentive for the creditors, who are after all the ones who have the most to lose, to choose the less expensive option of allowing the directors to run the day-to-day affairs of the company.

Since it is the creditors who have the most to lose, it seems appropriate to allow them to make a choice as to whether an administrator or directors should have the day-to-day running of the company under an arrangement. There should not be an incentive to choose an administrator over the directors. In order to give them an unfettered choice, there should be a reward for all creditors dealing with a company in difficulties and giving it a second chance, irrespective of whether the directors or the administrator have the day-to-day running of the company.

All debts, irrespective of whether the administrator or the directors had the day-to-day running of the company, would then get priority.

         —This amendment is not surprising. In order to speak to the amendment let me go into a little background. The Corporations Law Amendment Bill has been brought on with some urgency, which is understandable because of what was described by Justice Cohen in the New South Wales Supreme Court decision of Re Crawford House Pty Ltd as a loophole. That decision was handed down as recently as 13 June 1995 and His Honour said of the loophole that it is not satisfactory that the position should be left as it is and that it requires urgent legislative amendment.

         In order to understand what His Honour was concerned about, a little further background may assist. An administrator was appointed to the company, Crawford House Pty Ltd, in December 1993. At a creditors meeting it was resolved that the company should enter into a deed of company arrangement in the form approved by the creditors. A clause of the deed provided that the administrator should cease carrying on the company's business and instead the company itself was to continue in business and pay money to the administrator for the purpose of his making distributions in a prescribed manner.

         The company continued to trade, but not very successfully. A meeting of creditors was held in June 1994 at which it was resolved to terminate the deed of company arrangement and wind up the company. During the period from December 1993 to June 1994 when the company was trading under the deed of company arrangement, additional debts of over $38,000 were incurred. The liquidator sought the court's directions as to whether the creditors in question were unsecured creditors, creditors as part of the costs of the winding up or not creditors at all.

         The relevant provisions of the Corporations Law were quite new. They were introduced by the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992, which commenced in part in February and in part in June of 1993. The law provides that where—immediately before a voluntary winding-up resolution is passed—a company is under administration, the winding-up is taken to have commenced on the day on which the administration began. In the Crawford House case, the date of commencement of the winding-up was the day when the administration began: namely, a date in December 1993.

         A problem arises, because the Corporations Law also provides that the debts which are admissible to prove against a company that is winding up are all debts the circumstances giving rise to which occurred before the day on which the winding-up began.

        The law provides that the voluntary administration provisions of the Corporations Law serve two purposes. The first is to maximise the chances of the company's continuing in existence.

         Before the Crawford House decision, it was thought that debts incurred during the operation of a deed of company arrangement ranked in priority to other unsecured creditors in any winding-up. The reason for this is that such creditors should have an incentive or reward for dealing with the company in difficulties and, in so doing, giving it a second chance. The Crawford House case has made it clear that these creditors do not have any such priority. However, the result is otherwise where the administrator, rather than the directors, is carrying out the day-to-day running of the company.

         As my colleague the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has said, the effect of this is to discourage creditors from dealing with the company under a deed of company arrangement if the directors, rather than an administrator, are in charge. If an administrator is in charge under the deed of company arrangement, the debts incurred during the period of the deed of company arrangement will rank in priority to other unsecured creditors. The effect of this, as the member for Berowra has explained, will clearly provide a disincentive for those creditors considering extending further credit to the company to help it continue to trade.

         If the creditors want to ensure that the increase in their debts will be protected by a priority ranking, they will need to appoint an administrator to run the company, rather than allow the directors to control the day-to-day management of the company. The disadvantage of this is that the less expensive option is likely to be having the directors run the company. In order that the creditors have a real choice as to whether they appoint an administrator to run the business or allow the company directors to continue running the business, all trade debts incurred under a deed of company arrangement should have the same priority ranking.

         It is important that this anomaly in the legislation is rectified, and the bill will do that. There is, I should mention also, retrospective application of the bill. This is in order to validate the actions of a liquidator who has recognised a debt which, according to the Crawford House case, should have been rejected by the liquidator. The retrospectivity will date back to the commencement in June 1993 of the voluntary administration scheme provisions of the Corporations Law. This retrospectivity would be objectionable if someone had arranged their affairs in reliance on the debts not being provable. Such a person or company would be seeking to take advantage of the loophole in the legislation to avoid paying a properly incurred debt. Such a person or company cannot expect the protection of this parliament for that purpose.

         Retrospective legislation as a class is invidious, and there are few exceptions. Since the retrospective element of this bill is designed to ensure that a particular group of creditors will have the right to prove for their debts in the winding up of the debtor company, it is difficult to see the disadvantage of that provision. Obviously, the preferable course would be for the government to have got its legislation right the first time round.

         The coalition, as the member for Berowra has pointed out, does not oppose this bill, but is of the view that all debts incurred by a company under a deed of company arrangement should have a priority ranking over the unsecured debts. To that end, I support the amendment moved by the member for Berowra.

         The Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1995 seeks to overturn the decision in the New South Wales Supreme Court case Re Crawford House Press Pty Ltd. Indeed, the justice in that case, Mr Justice Cohen, indicated that the law clearly had an unintended consequence and as a result recommended amendment of the law. Consequently we have this bill currently before the chamber.

         The law as it previously existed adversely affected creditors who deal with a company while it is under voluntary administration. The coalition, as is usual with bills of this nature, has consulted widely in the Australian community. We have spoken to the attorneys-general, the Law Council of Australia, the Insolvency Practitioners Association, various law societies, bar associations, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. Consequently, the amendment which is being moved by the honourable member for Berowra, I suppose one could say, is the result of the collective wisdom of all of those groups, who see that there is a need to amend the legislation but who believe that the legislation should be improved as a result of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra.

         As I said, in the case Re Crawford House Press Pty Ltd there clearly was highlighted an unintended consequence of the legislation which is currently law in this nation. Because of an anomaly in a section of the Corporations Law, the Crawford House Press case held that, if debts are incurred by the directors of a company in lieu of the administrator, the debts not only do not rank at all but are not provable. As a result of the legislation which the court case proved to be flawed, debts of $38,118 could not be proven and the creditors were forced to take their case to court.

Mr Taylor pointed out that the 1993 reforms had been very well utilised, that more than 1,200 companies had entered into voluntary administration and that more than half of those had entered a deed of company arrangement with their creditors.

         —I thank the members of the opposition for the constructive way they have approached this issue. The government is well aware of the issue concerning the appropriate priority which should be given to post-deed creditors in a winding-up. That is the issue of whether those creditors should rank ahead of those creditors who are parties to the deed of arrangement. We do not propose at this time to accept the amendment. This is a complex issue which needs more detailed consideration, and not in the context of a bill which is designed to overcome an anomaly which requires an urgent response. This bill is not intended to make any substantive changes to the way in which the law operates.

         Of course, the government has always intended the voluntary administration scheme, which only commenced operation in 1993, to be reviewed after a couple of years. The review is intended to commence during next year and will take into account any recommendations of the Legal Committee of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, which I understand will be considering various technical aspects with regard to the operation of the voluntary administration scheme. I give an undertaking on behalf of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) that the question of the appropriate priority that should be given to post-deed creditors when dealing with a company will also be considered as part of that wider review, and that that will be done as a process of full and open consultation.

I do not accept the proposition that the opposition's amendments reflect some form of collective wisdom which has been distilled in that process.

         In any case, there will obviously need to be persuasive reasons to give post-deed creditors a special priority, especially as this may result in pre-deed creditors being less inclined to enter into a deed in the first place. In particular, there is a real risk that pre-deed creditors would be much more likely to liquidate a company rather than to lose their priority. Another undesirable aspect of the opposition amendment is that it appears to give post-deed creditors priority over employee entitlements, and that would obviously be an undesirable result.

         I do not understand, in the context of the background of this, the need to proceed with the amendment. I see the fact that the consequences have not been fully thought through and may, in the view of some, undermine seriously the validity or the viability of the voluntary administration scheme. There will be a policy debate, which of course will be addressed to this next year, as part of that larger review. The policy on priority of debts is a very serious issue, and the government does not accept that it should be changed in a fundamental way in a `minutes to midnight' amendment to a bill which simply seeks to correct an anomaly.

         —I thank the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) for the explanation. It may not surprise the minister that we will persist with our amendment, as these matters were the subject of some discussion. It is our view that the amendment that we propose addresses situations which could well require this protection now, and the government's remedy really only provides for an administrator to have this protection rather than for situations in which creditors have agreed to the administration being continued with the directors who have the experience, know the business and may be better placed, because of the nature of the circumstances in which the administration is occurring, to continue the management of the business. Those directors have the experience and background and are better placed to be able to trade the company out of what might have been a difficulty that arose because of a one-off situation.

         One can imagine a situation where a person has a major debt to a company and where, for one reason or another totally unrelated to the management of the business, the particular debt is one which affects the viability of the corporation because of the failure of that third party. It does not reflect upon the competency of those who were actually running the corporation. Yet the government's amendment, as we have said, will put the creditors in a situation where they cannot exercise a judgment as to whether, in the particular administration, the choice ought to be in favour of the directors continuing to run the operation. If in further examination some difficulties were raised—we do not think they would be—the matter could be addressed again. The government's proposal means that there may well be numbers of people in the same situation that we found with Crawford House that their measure will not cover or address.
